3
00:00:46,593 --> 00:00:49,528
Long ago,
our galaxy was ruled

4
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,803
by an alien race
called the Eridians

5
00:00:52,905 --> 00:00:54,631
whose power and technology

6
00:00:54,733 --> 00:00:56,702
were far beyond
human comprehension.

7
00:01:01,377 --> 00:01:03,808
Though they disappeared
ages ago,

8
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:07,248
they left behind fragments
of their technology,

9
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,952
scraps that became
the foundation

10
00:01:10,054 --> 00:01:11,519
for all human advancement.

11
00:01:13,389 --> 00:01:15,759
But the Eridians'
greatest secrets

12
00:01:15,861 --> 00:01:17,894
were hidden in a vault

13
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:20,198
located on the planet Pandora.

14
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,263
The once peaceful world
was overrun by corporations,

15
00:01:27,365 --> 00:01:28,767
criminals,

16
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:30,734
- and treasure seekers...
-Guns, guns, guns!

17
00:01:30,837 --> 00:01:32,667
...fighting
and killing one another

18
00:01:32,769 --> 00:01:34,311
for a chance to find the vault.

19
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:40,416
But it remained hidden.

20
00:01:42,748 --> 00:01:45,957
Then, amidst
the clouds of chaos,

21
00:01:46,059 --> 00:01:47,984
a glimmer of hope
shone through.

22
00:01:48,925 --> 00:01:50,228
A prophecy.

23
00:01:50,862 --> 00:01:52,261
That one day,

24
00:01:52,364 --> 00:01:55,693
a daughter of Eridia
would open the vault

25
00:01:55,796 --> 00:01:58,797
and restore order
to the broken planet.

26
00:02:01,068 --> 00:02:02,436
Yeah.

27
00:02:02,538 --> 00:02:05,207
That sounds like
some wacko B.S., right?

28
00:02:05,309 --> 00:02:07,179
Well, I thought so too,
until...

29
00:02:08,609 --> 00:02:09,907
this mess happened.

30
00:02:14,887 --> 00:02:15,652
There he is!

31
00:02:15,754 --> 00:02:16,749
Stop!

32
00:02:33,432 --> 00:02:34,905
God damn!

33
00:02:35,007 --> 00:02:36,874
There's no air holes in there.

34
00:02:36,976 --> 00:02:39,178
What a stupid helmet.

35
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,511
Tina.

36
00:02:41,613 --> 00:02:42,610
Hey.

37
00:02:45,586 --> 00:02:46,851
I'm Roland.

38
00:02:46,953 --> 00:02:48,346
Yeah. There's been some, uh...

39
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,716
There's been some trouble.

40
00:02:50,514 --> 00:02:51,890
And Atlas,

41
00:02:51,992 --> 00:02:53,456
he sent me
to bring you to safety.

42
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:56,926
- My dad sent you?
- That's right.

43
00:02:57,028 --> 00:02:58,422
His shortest soldier?

44
00:02:58,524 --> 00:03:00,030
Yeah, his shortest soldier

45
00:03:00,132 --> 00:03:02,158
to save his least
funny daughter.

46
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,934
Code three security breach.

47
00:03:04,036 --> 00:03:05,729
The station is in lockdown.

48
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:07,938
All personnel
must shelter in place.

49
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,240
- Okay, let's go.
- Hey, hey, hey!

50
00:03:10,343 --> 00:03:12,073
- Let's slow down.
-Target in sight!

51
00:03:19,643 --> 00:03:20,978
Come on. Come on.

52
00:03:21,853 --> 00:03:22,587
Stop!

53
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:25,257
Stay down!

54
00:03:29,686 --> 00:03:31,555
- Oh, God.
- No, no!

55
00:03:31,657 --> 00:03:32,891
Catch.

56
00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:37,392
Fake stormtrooper-ass bitch.

57
00:03:37,495 --> 00:03:38,697
Come here.

58
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,561
Code three security breach.

59
00:03:39,663 --> 00:03:40,630
Come on. Come on.

60
00:03:40,732 --> 00:03:42,030
The station is now in lockdown.

61
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:43,774
Wait, I changed my mind.
Take me back to my cell.

62
00:03:43,876 --> 00:03:45,541
- Please.
- Come on.

63
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,081
Holy shit!
One of the Psychos got out.

64
00:03:51,183 --> 00:03:52,915
It's time to go insane!

65
00:03:56,013 --> 00:03:58,714
You're in my spot.

66
00:03:58,816 --> 00:04:00,591
Put him down. Put him down.

67
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:07,563
Hey, easy.

68
00:04:08,197 --> 00:04:09,463
What do you, uh...

69
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:10,698
What do you say
me and you be friends?

70
00:04:11,705 --> 00:04:12,669
Shit.

71
00:04:13,938 --> 00:04:15,307
Sorry, Knoxx.

72
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,541
My girl.

73
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,947
Krieg,
what's up, man?

74
00:04:24,049 --> 00:04:24,778
You want some pancakes?

75
00:04:25,853 --> 00:04:27,918
My girl broken.

76
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,321
It's Krieg, right?

77
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,082
Yeah.

78
00:04:33,921 --> 00:04:35,591
What do you say you help me
get her outta here?

79
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,330
Yeah.

80
00:04:47,907 --> 00:04:49,273
Of course,

81
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,142
we can't all be
the daughter of Eridia,

82
00:04:51,244 --> 00:04:54,003
skipping down
the path of destiny.

83
00:04:54,105 --> 00:04:57,039
Some of us
have to work for a living.

84
00:04:57,142 --> 00:04:58,641
You don't have
to do this, you know.

85
00:04:58,743 --> 00:05:01,012
I mean, I can pay you.

86
00:05:01,114 --> 00:05:03,654
Yeah, whatever's in my wallet
right now, it's yours.

87
00:05:03,756 --> 00:05:05,179
Okay?

88
00:05:05,282 --> 00:05:07,718
Shut up
or I'll break your other arm.

89
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,858
Oh, no,
one arm's good.

90
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,186
That's fine.

91
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:22,770
-'Sup?
- Sorry.

92
00:05:26,847 --> 00:05:29,179
- Quinn.
- Lilith.

93
00:05:29,281 --> 00:05:31,183
We do have other seats,
you know.

94
00:05:31,285 --> 00:05:32,879
Then he won't have
any trouble finding one.

95
00:05:34,018 --> 00:05:35,019
Uh, not tonight.

96
00:05:35,121 --> 00:05:36,753
Top shelf.

97
00:05:38,952 --> 00:05:41,016
Not sure how top
you think the shelves are.

98
00:05:41,118 --> 00:05:43,692
Eh, buy your kid
some dance lessons.

99
00:05:45,832 --> 00:05:47,223
Hot date?

100
00:05:47,325 --> 00:05:49,660
You remember that heist down
in Lectra City last month?

101
00:05:49,762 --> 00:05:51,226
Yeah, a couple of guards died.

102
00:05:51,328 --> 00:05:53,369
Yeah, well, this sad sack
was the trigger man.

103
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:54,531
Listen, I never meant
to shoot anyone.

104
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:56,735
I was...

105
00:05:56,837 --> 00:05:58,476
I'm getting too old
for this shit.

106
00:06:00,177 --> 00:06:01,675
Bounty hunting? Uh.

107
00:06:01,777 --> 00:06:04,075
It's for the young and stupid.
Am I right?

108
00:06:05,383 --> 00:06:06,783
You really want me
to answer that?

109
00:06:06,886 --> 00:06:07,784
I do not.

110
00:06:07,886 --> 00:06:08,882
Lilith.

111
00:06:11,156 --> 00:06:12,554
Piss off.

112
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:15,022
I heard you were quite
the crusty old...

113
00:06:17,964 --> 00:06:19,891
Wait. Wait, wait.

114
00:06:19,993 --> 00:06:22,929
We, uh, maybe got off
on the wrong foot.

115
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:25,195
You see, um...

116
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:30,734
I represent a very wealthy man

117
00:06:30,836 --> 00:06:32,810
who has a contract for you.

118
00:06:32,912 --> 00:06:34,076
I've got a job.

119
00:06:34,178 --> 00:06:35,574
Maybe next month.

120
00:06:35,676 --> 00:06:37,212
You collect on that scum

121
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,146
dead or alive, right?

122
00:06:39,248 --> 00:06:41,150
Hey.

123
00:06:41,252 --> 00:06:42,113
Not in here, big boy.

124
00:06:43,386 --> 00:06:45,051
We don't want any trouble.

125
00:06:45,153 --> 00:06:49,056
It's just, uh, our employer
is, uh, not one for waiting.

126
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,187
Who is?

127
00:07:06,773 --> 00:07:09,181
Are you with these assholes?

128
00:07:09,283 --> 00:07:10,948
Or are you just a fan
of violence?

129
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,611
These gentlemen work

130
00:07:12,713 --> 00:07:15,784
or should I say "worked" for me?

131
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,921
I'll get Kimber
to clean this up.

132
00:07:21,752 --> 00:07:22,593
Thanks, Quinn.

133
00:07:27,424 --> 00:07:29,796
That was impressive.

134
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:32,697
I warned them
not to underestimate you.

135
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:35,268
My name is Deukalian Atlas.

136
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,972
And, uh...

137
00:07:37,075 --> 00:07:38,009
Hold on.

138
00:07:38,111 --> 00:07:39,835
This is...

139
00:07:39,937 --> 00:07:41,880
This is rather awkward.

140
00:07:41,982 --> 00:07:43,341
Hey, you there.

141
00:07:43,444 --> 00:07:44,673
Fat boy.

142
00:07:44,775 --> 00:07:47,275
Put me on.

143
00:07:47,378 --> 00:07:50,621
But she just
killed Frank and Wes.

144
00:07:50,723 --> 00:07:53,316
But she would never
shoot a man of your caliber.

145
00:07:54,995 --> 00:07:55,758
Mm.

146
00:08:05,434 --> 00:08:06,697
As I was saying...

147
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:08,396
Start walking.

148
00:08:08,498 --> 00:08:10,140
My name is Deukalian Atlas.

149
00:08:10,242 --> 00:08:11,207
President of the...

150
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:12,973
The Atlas Corporation?

151
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,007
Clue's in the name.

152
00:08:16,109 --> 00:08:19,049
Look, uh, this has been
a really long day.

153
00:08:19,151 --> 00:08:21,251
Can we just skip to,

154
00:08:21,353 --> 00:08:23,020
I don't know, whatever this is?

155
00:08:23,122 --> 00:08:24,353
Of course.

156
00:08:24,455 --> 00:08:26,355
My daughter has been kidnapped,

157
00:08:26,457 --> 00:08:27,818
and I need her returned to me.

158
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,155
Bounty hunter, not babysitter.

159
00:08:31,257 --> 00:08:33,823
Haven't you got some
toy soldiers you can send?

160
00:08:33,925 --> 00:08:36,391
Yes, the Crimson Lance.

161
00:08:36,493 --> 00:08:38,861
Unfortunately, the kidnapper
is one of them.

162
00:08:38,963 --> 00:08:40,702
I need an outsider.

163
00:08:40,804 --> 00:08:42,506
Someone who knows
how to handle a planet

164
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:44,703
full of Psychos, skags,
and vault hunters

165
00:08:44,805 --> 00:08:46,276
like they were born there.

166
00:08:46,378 --> 00:08:49,378
Your daughter's on Pandora?

167
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,446
Thoughts and prayers.

168
00:08:51,548 --> 00:08:52,614
But you couldn't pay me enough

169
00:08:52,716 --> 00:08:54,283
to set foot
on that shithole again.

170
00:08:54,385 --> 00:08:56,018
Are you sure about that?

171
00:08:57,285 --> 00:08:58,714
Oh.

172
00:08:58,816 --> 00:09:00,524
Maybe you could.

173
00:09:00,627 --> 00:09:03,386
Okay, I'll start
when my current contract ends.

174
00:09:08,691 --> 00:09:10,063
Seems like you're free
to start immediately.

175
00:09:12,865 --> 00:09:14,166
Give her the beacon.

176
00:09:17,171 --> 00:09:19,410
Activate this device
when you find my daughter

177
00:09:19,512 --> 00:09:21,545
and my people
will retrieve her.

178
00:09:21,647 --> 00:09:24,380
You haven't disappointed
so far, Lilith.

179
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:26,277
I advise you not to start.

180
00:09:28,153 --> 00:09:29,016
Sorry.

181
00:09:34,027 --> 00:09:35,385
Oh, shit.

182
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:57,481
Thank you for
flying Atlas transport pods.

183
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,112
You've arrived
at your destination.

184
00:09:59,877 --> 00:10:01,345
Pandora.

185
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:03,350
Let me tell you
everything you need to know

186
00:10:03,452 --> 00:10:04,722
about Pandora.

187
00:10:09,195 --> 00:10:10,855
It's a shithole.

188
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,790
I should know. I'm from here.

189
00:10:12,892 --> 00:10:14,589
God, I hate this planet.

190
00:10:15,268 --> 00:10:17,158
It's the kind of place

191
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,594
you don't ever wanna return to.

192
00:10:21,099 --> 00:10:24,300
So, the sooner I find the girl,

193
00:10:24,403 --> 00:10:27,272
the sooner I can
get the hell outta here.

194
00:10:30,277 --> 00:10:32,714
The soldier had hijacked
one of Atlas' shuttles

195
00:10:32,816 --> 00:10:35,319
and crash-landed here
months ago.

196
00:10:35,422 --> 00:10:37,178
There wasn't much left of it.

197
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,522
It'd been stripped for parts

198
00:10:38,624 --> 00:10:42,286
and vandalized
by vault hunters.

199
00:10:42,388 --> 00:10:45,219
No way to know
if he and Tina even survived.

200
00:10:45,321 --> 00:10:47,289
Wanna know if you've seen her.

201
00:10:47,391 --> 00:10:48,798
But then I spoke
to some locals.

202
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,866
Scavenger kids
barely scraping out a living.

203
00:10:52,968 --> 00:10:54,536
They told me
Tina and the soldier

204
00:10:54,638 --> 00:10:55,869
had passed through weeks ago

205
00:10:55,971 --> 00:10:58,641
heading north
towards Fyrestone.

206
00:10:58,743 --> 00:11:01,078
Then I ran
into some other locals.

207
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,546
Run!

208
00:11:02,648 --> 00:11:04,782
Psychos.
Murderous gangs.

209
00:11:14,618 --> 00:11:16,558
It was time to catch a ride
and head north.

210
00:11:20,432 --> 00:11:22,231
Hello, vault hunter.

211
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,424
Need a ride?

212
00:11:23,526 --> 00:11:24,894
Yeah, I'm not
a vault hunter, but...

213
00:11:24,996 --> 00:11:26,568
Then welcome aboard.

214
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,605
People inside, bags up top.

215
00:11:28,707 --> 00:11:30,872
Don't need
any explosives going pop.

216
00:11:30,974 --> 00:11:33,376
That is a mess to clean up,
believe me.

217
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:42,549
Hello, passenger.

218
00:11:42,651 --> 00:11:44,151
My name is Marcus.

219
00:11:45,015 --> 00:11:46,049
But of course,

220
00:11:46,151 --> 00:11:48,359
you're not here for small talk.

221
00:11:48,461 --> 00:11:51,196
You are here to find the vault.

222
00:11:51,298 --> 00:11:52,262
Uh, you can stop there.

223
00:11:52,364 --> 00:11:53,362
Not a vault hunter.

224
00:11:53,464 --> 00:11:54,331
Just need a ride.

225
00:11:54,433 --> 00:11:56,433
If you say so.

226
00:12:01,201 --> 00:12:04,441
Well, hello,
brave vault hunter.

227
00:12:04,543 --> 00:12:06,776
So, you've come in search

228
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:09,940
of the secret lost vault
of the Eridians,

229
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:13,741
right here on Pandora!

230
00:12:13,843 --> 00:12:16,618
Do you want to be rich
beyond your wildest dreams?

231
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,547
First, you must find the keys,

232
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:21,458
then the vault itself,
but it won't be easy.

233
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,392
Could you turn this shit off?

234
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:24,457
Not a vault hunter.

235
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,060
No can do.

236
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:29,262
This bus is for transporting
vault hunters, so...

237
00:12:29,364 --> 00:12:32,398
Will you be
the one to find the vault?

238
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,264
Ancient alien treasure filled
with high-tech secrets...

239
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:38,233
Pandora is a dangerous place,

240
00:12:38,335 --> 00:12:40,504
so you need superior firepower.

241
00:12:40,606 --> 00:12:42,644
Prepare yourself
with one of Marcus' munitions.

242
00:12:42,747 --> 00:12:45,273
Next stop, Fyrestone,

243
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,448
where all vault hunters begin.

244
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,516
Uh, no.

245
00:12:48,618 --> 00:12:51,248
Really, I am not...

246
00:12:54,094 --> 00:12:54,826
Thanks.

247
00:12:55,725 --> 00:12:57,662
Good luck, vault hunter.

248
00:12:57,764 --> 00:13:00,361
I hope you find
what you're searching for.

249
00:13:57,184 --> 00:13:58,888
Two weeks on the trail,

250
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,958
and it was as cold
as Pandora's moons.

251
00:14:02,454 --> 00:14:05,259
Tina and the soldier
were long gone.

252
00:14:05,361 --> 00:14:09,197
I needed a miracle,
but I got something else.

253
00:14:22,848 --> 00:14:25,350
My eye!

254
00:14:25,452 --> 00:14:27,451
You shot me in my eye!

255
00:14:27,553 --> 00:14:28,750
You blinded me for life!

256
00:14:28,852 --> 00:14:30,717
How will I manage to survive?

257
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:32,550
I'm just kidding!

258
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:35,584
I was designed to withstand
all kinds of violent acts,

259
00:14:35,686 --> 00:14:38,529
even completely
unjustified ones like yours.

260
00:14:38,631 --> 00:14:40,124
Now, I bet you're wondering,

261
00:14:40,226 --> 00:14:42,090
what's the deal with this thing?

262
00:14:42,192 --> 00:14:43,258
Uh, no, I'm not.

263
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,692
I'm programmed for humor,

264
00:14:44,794 --> 00:14:46,533
so I will process that
as "witty banter."

265
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:47,604
Beat it.

266
00:14:47,706 --> 00:14:50,633
I'm a Hyperion brand CL4P-TP,

267
00:14:50,735 --> 00:14:53,268
possibly the last of my kind
still in service.

268
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,407
But you can call me...

269
00:14:55,238 --> 00:14:56,440
Whoopsie! Ha!

270
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:58,541
You accidentally shot me
in the face again.

271
00:14:58,643 --> 00:15:00,382
As I was saying,
you can call me Claptrap.

272
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,452
You know,
I can do this all night,

273
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:04,755
so piss off.

274
00:15:04,857 --> 00:15:05,822
Believe me,
I wish I could

275
00:15:05,924 --> 00:15:07,151
based on what little
I've experienced

276
00:15:07,253 --> 00:15:09,460
of your horrendous personality.

277
00:15:09,562 --> 00:15:11,252
But I have no choice.

278
00:15:11,354 --> 00:15:12,759
What do you mean?

279
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:14,265
Did Atlas send you?

280
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:15,798
Atlas? Yuck!

281
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,264
I don't work
for the competition.

282
00:15:17,366 --> 00:15:19,570
No, I've been lying dormant
under a garbage heap

283
00:15:19,672 --> 00:15:21,739
for... calculating... 36 years!

284
00:15:21,841 --> 00:15:23,803
But the moment
you landed on Pandora,

285
00:15:23,905 --> 00:15:25,604
I was reactivated

286
00:15:25,706 --> 00:15:28,271
because I've been programmed
to help you upon your return!

287
00:15:28,373 --> 00:15:29,445
No one knew I was coming here.

288
00:15:29,547 --> 00:15:31,239
Not even me.

289
00:15:31,341 --> 00:15:32,415
Who programmed you?

290
00:15:32,517 --> 00:15:33,951
I don't know!

291
00:15:34,053 --> 00:15:35,776
Which is a shame,
because you're an awful person

292
00:15:35,878 --> 00:15:37,812
and I'd love to know
who to blame for this.

293
00:15:37,914 --> 00:15:40,281
Since I don't, I have
no choice but to serve you

294
00:15:40,383 --> 00:15:41,957
until you're dead.

295
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:43,925
Did that sound like a threat?
Sorry.

296
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:46,354
Anyway, as long as
you're not dead,

297
00:15:46,456 --> 00:15:47,630
- I'm here to help.
- Oh.

298
00:15:47,732 --> 00:15:49,266
And I have many skills.

299
00:15:49,369 --> 00:15:51,160
Balancing.

300
00:15:51,262 --> 00:15:52,536
Turning in circles.

301
00:15:52,638 --> 00:15:54,266
I don't need a partner.

302
00:15:54,368 --> 00:15:56,540
Uh, I can also access
the ECHOnet.

303
00:15:56,642 --> 00:15:58,708
Did you say "ECHOnet"?

304
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,271
Can you use it to find someone?

305
00:16:00,373 --> 00:16:01,808
Of course.
Just show me a picture.

306
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,308
I'll hack and search

307
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,179
its slowly dying
visual banks for matches

308
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:07,383
and find your target's
last known location.

309
00:16:07,486 --> 00:16:08,643
Find her.

310
00:16:08,745 --> 00:16:10,553
She was last seen
outside Fyrestone.

311
00:16:10,655 --> 00:16:13,550
Accessing network.

Your target was last recorded

321
00:16:29,504 --> 00:16:31,740
near an abandoned quarry
in the Tundra Express!

322
00:16:31,842 --> 00:16:33,978
It's only 132 days on foot

323
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,876
with a 98% chance of being
eaten by a Craw maggot!

324
00:16:36,978 --> 00:16:39,309
I like those odds!

325
00:16:39,411 --> 00:16:40,645
We're gonna need some wheels.

326
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:46,249
That's the Crimson Lance,
Atlas' private army.

327
00:16:46,351 --> 00:16:47,690
What are they doing here?

328
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:49,684
Oh, just a guess here.

329
00:16:49,786 --> 00:16:52,525
Exactly the same thing
you're doing.

330
00:16:52,627 --> 00:16:55,559
And the Lance
teaming up with the Psychos?

331
00:16:55,661 --> 00:16:57,099
It seems like Atlas will hire

332
00:16:57,201 --> 00:16:59,034
just about anyone
to find his daughter.

333
00:16:59,136 --> 00:17:01,468
Concentrating.
Sorry.

334
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:06,402
Huh. The Lance are leaving.

335
00:17:06,504 --> 00:17:07,877
I guess they didn't find her.

336
00:17:07,979 --> 00:17:09,745
No more Mommy!

337
00:17:09,847 --> 00:17:11,973
Free lunch! Hot delivery!

338
00:17:14,513 --> 00:17:16,186
Huh?

339
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:27,257
That was so out of character
to save those children.

340
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,697
Well, I needed a ride.

341
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,099
For a second there,

342
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:32,099
I thought you weren't
a horrible person.

343
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:34,730
Phew! The world
makes sense again.

344
00:17:34,832 --> 00:17:36,473
Now, there's only room
for one up front,

345
00:17:36,575 --> 00:17:37,773
but worry not.

346
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,671
I can sit on your lap.

347
00:17:42,382 --> 00:17:43,441
Lilith!

348
00:17:43,543 --> 00:17:45,743
You accidentally locked me
in the back!

349
00:17:46,551 --> 00:17:48,614
Lilith!

350
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,782
Please drain my battery.

351
00:18:19,884 --> 00:18:20,913
Put me back to sleep.

352
00:18:21,015 --> 00:18:22,687
I won't tell.

353
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:23,919
You said you wanted to help.

354
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:25,648
I said I'm programmed to help.

355
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,757
What I want to do
is wipe my memory,

356
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:29,785
you horrendous she-devil.

357
00:18:29,888 --> 00:18:31,954
Are you sure these
are the right coordinates?

358
00:18:32,056 --> 00:18:34,631
Yes. This is the last known
location of your quarry.

359
00:18:34,733 --> 00:18:37,364
Get it?

360
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:38,829
But it looks like
she's long gone by now.

361
00:18:41,969 --> 00:18:43,064
Does it?

362
00:19:14,405 --> 00:19:16,768
You know, it's quite
a menagerie you've got here.

363
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:21,971
You could start
your own Pandoran zoo.

364
00:19:28,578 --> 00:19:30,111
You must be Tina.

365
00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:34,852
Name's Lilith.

366
00:19:37,862 --> 00:19:39,725
So, that soldier...

367
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,757
who brought you here,

368
00:19:41,859 --> 00:19:43,058
is he playing
hide-and-seek, too?

369
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:45,528
He left me.

370
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,897
I haven't seen him in days.

371
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:49,837
Well, I'm here to take you home

372
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,373
to your father.

373
00:19:52,475 --> 00:19:55,405
Yeah, he seems like
a real, uh, sweetheart.

374
00:19:55,507 --> 00:19:56,945
What? My daddy?

375
00:19:57,047 --> 00:19:58,878
I get to see my daddy?

376
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,376
Really?

377
00:20:00,478 --> 00:20:01,579
I've been so afraid.

378
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:02,852
- Yeah.
-I've been scared.

379
00:20:02,954 --> 00:20:04,288
Speaking of your daddy...

380
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,685
The noises outside
really freaked me out.

381
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,047
I've just gotta let him know
that I got you safe...

382
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:08,020
I should probably
get my stuff.

383
00:20:08,122 --> 00:20:09,091
Shit.

384
00:20:09,193 --> 00:20:11,952
I really love my daddy.

385
00:20:12,054 --> 00:20:14,791
He's such a nurturing
parental figure.

386
00:20:14,893 --> 00:20:16,663
Sure, I'll have to take
your word for it.

387
00:20:21,531 --> 00:20:22,763
Miss Lilith,

388
00:20:22,865 --> 00:20:24,869
can you grab my Badonkadonk?

389
00:20:26,074 --> 00:20:27,509
Your what now?

390
00:20:36,084 --> 00:20:37,453
You little...

391
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,764
I love it
when bounty hunters drop by.

392
00:20:46,866 --> 00:20:48,590
Time to make it rain...

393
00:20:48,692 --> 00:20:49,766
with your body parts.

394
00:20:59,569 --> 00:21:01,109
Hey.

395
00:21:01,211 --> 00:21:02,907
You still alive down there?

396
00:21:05,842 --> 00:21:08,776
She seems deranged.

397
00:21:08,878 --> 00:21:10,453
You two have a lot in common.

398
00:21:13,192 --> 00:21:14,787
Only she's smaller,
nicer, cuter.

399
00:21:16,195 --> 00:21:17,825
Hope that wasn't
something important.

400
00:21:17,928 --> 00:21:19,657
Fix this.

401
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:21,659
Because, whoo, it's toast.

402
00:21:23,892 --> 00:21:25,160
Where'd you go?

403
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,162
Tina.

404
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:31,934
Look, I... I'm here to save you.

405
00:21:32,036 --> 00:21:33,843
Do I look like
I need saving?

406
00:21:33,945 --> 00:21:35,706
'Cause I'm up here

407
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:37,538
and you're all hiding
under a car.

408
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,839
Like a bitch!

409
00:21:38,941 --> 00:21:40,874
You get down here right now.

410
00:21:40,976 --> 00:21:43,788
Oh, Krieg!

411
00:21:47,585 --> 00:21:49,456
This fancy-ass woman

412
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,659
just pointed a gun
at your best friend.

413
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:55,866
I will lick
your spine clean.

414
00:21:55,968 --> 00:21:58,001
Holed up with Psychos?

415
00:21:58,103 --> 00:22:01,069
He only used to be a Psycho.

416
00:22:01,171 --> 00:22:03,202
Now he's my big brother!

417
00:22:03,304 --> 00:22:04,870
How sweet.

418
00:22:04,972 --> 00:22:06,204
One of you kill the other,
I'm gonna go get a coffee.

419
00:22:16,187 --> 00:22:17,979
Tell her what she's won, Krieg.

420
00:22:18,081 --> 00:22:19,951
You've walked
the wrong dog.

421
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:23,719
Shoot him in the face.

422
00:22:23,821 --> 00:22:24,725
Shoot him in the face again.

423
00:22:27,663 --> 00:22:29,028
It's not working.
Forget it. Abort. Go!

424
00:22:29,131 --> 00:22:30,192
Run, run!

425
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,757
Mine's bigger.

426
00:22:57,697 --> 00:22:58,429
Listen.

427
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,724
I was sent by your father.

428
00:23:01,826 --> 00:23:03,398
Well, that's strange.

429
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,098
Because I don't
have a father, lady.

430
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:08,696
I know this planet
can mess with your mind.

431
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:09,906
My mind is awesome.

432
00:23:10,008 --> 00:23:11,804
My mind's so cool.

433
00:23:11,906 --> 00:23:15,068
Listen, I don't wanna be here.
Nothing personal.

434
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,277
So, if you could
just come with me,

435
00:23:16,379 --> 00:23:17,278
and you could talk to your dad

436
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,944
and you guys can sort it out,

437
00:23:19,046 --> 00:23:20,011
family style. And I can...

438
00:23:27,858 --> 00:23:30,285
Nice work, lady.
You led 'em straight to me.

439
00:23:30,387 --> 00:23:34,091
So, Atlas sent
someone new to find the girl.

440
00:23:34,193 --> 00:23:37,092
Never would have thought
it was a scumbag vault hunter.

441
00:23:37,194 --> 00:23:39,635
Actually, I'm not
a scumbag vault hunter.

442
00:23:39,737 --> 00:23:42,133
Actually,
she's a scumbag bounty hunter.

443
00:23:42,235 --> 00:23:44,272
You know, it's not
my fault you suck at your job,

444
00:23:44,374 --> 00:23:46,100
whoever you are. Who are you?

445
00:23:46,202 --> 00:23:48,243
Commander Knoxx
of the Crimson Lance.

446
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:49,944
And I'm taking the girl with me.

447
00:23:50,047 --> 00:23:51,178
Oh, yeah?

448
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,307
You and what army?

449
00:23:53,283 --> 00:23:54,749
The one right behind me.

450
00:23:58,684 --> 00:23:59,782
Move, move.

451
00:23:59,884 --> 00:24:01,090
Charlie team, right side.

452
00:24:01,192 --> 00:24:02,757
On your lead, with me!

453
00:24:04,721 --> 00:24:05,687
Stay behind me.

454
00:24:05,789 --> 00:24:07,129
- I'll go.
- Wait.

455
00:24:07,231 --> 00:24:08,859
And if you're both nice,

456
00:24:08,961 --> 00:24:11,227
I'll put in a good word
with Daddy.

457
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,163
Sounds good to me.

458
00:24:14,071 --> 00:24:15,701
Sergeant Russo,

459
00:24:15,803 --> 00:24:17,272
bring me a neurocollar
for the girl.

460
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:18,865
Copy that, Commander.

461
00:24:18,967 --> 00:24:20,935
A collar?

462
00:24:21,037 --> 00:24:22,310
I love new jewelry.

463
00:24:22,412 --> 00:24:24,581
Yeah, I got you a gift, too.

464
00:24:26,115 --> 00:24:27,111
Catch.

465
00:24:28,715 --> 00:24:30,119
Will you be my friend?

466
00:24:30,221 --> 00:24:31,016
Oh, shit!

467
00:24:31,957 --> 00:24:33,183
Yes!

468
00:24:40,461 --> 00:24:41,994
- Come on!
- Hey!

469
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,723
Oh, shit!

470
00:25:05,825 --> 00:25:06,887
Tina!

471
00:25:13,124 --> 00:25:14,488
Stop.
She's coming with me.

472
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,036
I leave you alone
for 10 minutes...

473
00:25:24,834 --> 00:25:25,834
Get in the car.

474
00:25:25,936 --> 00:25:27,077
It's okay. He's with me.

475
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:28,243
I wish I wasn't.

476
00:25:28,345 --> 00:25:29,877
Get in the car!

477
00:25:32,049 --> 00:25:33,215
Go, go!

478
00:25:40,523 --> 00:25:42,223
Lilith, wait for me!

479
00:25:42,325 --> 00:25:43,191
What did I tell you?

480
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:45,227
Minimal explosions.

481
00:25:45,329 --> 00:25:47,097
No, I said no explosions!

482
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:48,363
Who the hell are you?

483
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:50,257
This is Lilith. My dad sent her.

484
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:52,799
Oh. She's a scumbag
bounty hunter.

485
00:25:52,901 --> 00:25:55,362
No, I am a high-end
bounty hunter, pal.

486
00:25:55,464 --> 00:25:56,901
-No.
- And letting kids get shot at

487
00:25:57,003 --> 00:25:58,272
was not part
of my job description.

488
00:25:58,374 --> 00:25:59,407
Oh, I bet it wasn't.

489
00:25:59,509 --> 00:26:01,369
Lilith. Lilith.

490
00:26:01,471 --> 00:26:03,979
You inadvertently left
your best friend behind!

491
00:26:04,081 --> 00:26:05,715
To die!

492
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,048
Lilith!

493
00:26:16,194 --> 00:26:17,595
Move, move, move!

494
00:26:20,389 --> 00:26:21,264
Hey!
No pressure or anything

495
00:26:21,366 --> 00:26:23,060
but I'd love to come inside,

496
00:26:23,163 --> 00:26:24,735
- if you get a chance.
- What are you doing?

497
00:26:24,837 --> 00:26:27,468
Just hoping you can
reach out and scoop me up.

498
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:28,606
You don't have to stop, just...

499
00:26:29,941 --> 00:26:31,274
Hey!

500
00:26:31,376 --> 00:26:32,901
Go easy on the merchandise.

501
00:26:33,003 --> 00:26:34,403
Here they come!

502
00:26:38,475 --> 00:26:41,149
All units,
you are now weapons free!

503
00:26:41,251 --> 00:26:42,543
Take them down!

504
00:26:49,888 --> 00:26:51,156
Damn it! You know what?

505
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:53,290
You drive.

506
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:07,968
You programmed to steer?

507
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:08,811
Who, me?

508
00:27:16,047 --> 00:27:17,511
Who's driving the damn truck?

509
00:27:17,613 --> 00:27:19,389
♪ Driving, driving, driving ♪

510
00:27:19,491 --> 00:27:20,587
♪ I'm so good at driving ♪

511
00:27:20,689 --> 00:27:21,949
♪ I'm a robot driver ♪

512
00:27:30,998 --> 00:27:32,393
Locking on target, ma'am.

513
00:27:32,496 --> 00:27:34,133
We got a problem!

514
00:27:35,505 --> 00:27:36,300
Brace for impact!

515
00:27:38,343 --> 00:27:39,474
Holy underwear!

516
00:27:45,483 --> 00:27:47,443
I told you to drive. Damn it.

517
00:27:55,959 --> 00:27:58,729
Bandit one, four,
up on the right. Cut 'em off.

518
00:28:02,465 --> 00:28:03,459
They got us pinned.

519
00:28:05,503 --> 00:28:07,702
Not yet they don't. Hold on.

520
00:28:18,014 --> 00:28:19,882
- Brace yourselves.
-What are you doing?

521
00:28:33,531 --> 00:28:35,491
That was a terrible idea

522
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,266
but it worked.

523
00:28:37,368 --> 00:28:38,428
Mm, maybe.

524
00:28:40,062 --> 00:28:41,068
Where are we?

525
00:28:42,702 --> 00:28:44,170
Pisswash gully.

526
00:28:47,645 --> 00:28:49,610
What's that smell? Ugh.

527
00:28:49,712 --> 00:28:51,247
- Put the window up.
- Why?

528
00:28:51,349 --> 00:28:52,481
Put the window up!

529
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:54,280
What is that smell?

530
00:28:54,382 --> 00:28:55,818
What is this "smell"
thing everyone talks about?

531
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,545
- Listen to what I just said!
- I don't want to!

532
00:28:57,647 --> 00:28:59,121
- Roll the window up!
- Don't tell me what to...

533
00:29:04,054 --> 00:29:05,955
It's in my mouth!

534
00:29:06,057 --> 00:29:07,593
Sardine showers.

535
00:29:07,695 --> 00:29:09,259
It's pee. It's pee.

536
00:29:09,362 --> 00:29:11,800
Now I got pee
all in the middle of my truck.

537
00:29:11,902 --> 00:29:13,598
Correction.
It's 67% urine...

538
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,262
14% fecal...

539
00:29:25,109 --> 00:29:26,740
- Oh!
-Look out!

540
00:29:30,454 --> 00:29:31,481
Oh, God!

541
00:29:33,358 --> 00:29:34,589
Don't nobody move.

542
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:35,421
I'm not about to die in this...

543
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:36,653
Shut up.

544
00:29:41,133 --> 00:29:42,228
Okay.

545
00:29:43,566 --> 00:29:44,798
Is that...

546
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,126
This don't look so good.

547
00:29:46,228 --> 00:29:46,969
Yes, it is.

548
00:29:49,234 --> 00:29:50,533
That thing looks angry!

549
00:29:50,635 --> 00:29:52,139
- Do you wanna press reverse?
-Or hungry.

550
00:29:54,474 --> 00:29:55,609
Oh, my God. It's gonna kill us.
It's gonna kill us.

551
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:56,677
Wait a second.

552
00:29:56,779 --> 00:29:58,275
Do you want me to press reverse?

553
00:29:58,377 --> 00:29:59,348
No, I don't
want you to do nothing!

554
00:30:03,587 --> 00:30:04,822
Oh, my God!

555
00:30:08,824 --> 00:30:10,091
Your friends are back.

556
00:30:14,423 --> 00:30:16,564
Roland, don't be stupid.

557
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:18,125
Just give us the girl.

558
00:30:20,431 --> 00:30:23,368
Everybody, buckle up.
I got a plan.

559
00:30:25,643 --> 00:30:26,635
Somebody hold me!

560
00:30:28,338 --> 00:30:29,605
Seriously, I have no seat belt!

561
00:30:30,813 --> 00:30:33,180
Roland, what are you doing?

562
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,447
- Go, go, go!
-Hold on!

563
00:30:41,352 --> 00:30:42,387
- Hold it!
-No, no, no!

564
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,673
Shit.

565
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:00,911
Feels like we blew a tire.

566
00:31:01,678 --> 00:31:03,677
You call that a plan?

567
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,415
It worked, didn't it?

568
00:31:05,517 --> 00:31:06,477
Feel free to applaud.

569
00:31:11,348 --> 00:31:12,751
Yay for not dying!

570
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,112
Nothing.

571
00:31:39,512 --> 00:31:41,718
- You stay here and keep watch.
-Okay.

572
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,651
But it's you
they don't seem to trust.

573
00:31:43,753 --> 00:31:45,615
And who can blame them?

574
00:31:45,717 --> 00:31:48,090
♪ Scanning, scanning, scanning
Scanning ♪

575
00:31:55,898 --> 00:31:58,430
They should be after us by now.

576
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,497
Stingrays won't pursue
without ground support.

577
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:06,168
Knoxx'll wait on reinforcements.

578
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,439
Let it down, big guy.

579
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:11,440
Before you added kidnapping
to your resume

580
00:32:11,542 --> 00:32:13,348
you were an officer
in Crimson Lance.

581
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:14,784
Right?

582
00:32:14,886 --> 00:32:17,147
Roland didn't kidnap me.
He saved me.

583
00:32:17,249 --> 00:32:18,620
Saved you from what?

584
00:32:18,722 --> 00:32:20,318
A life of ease and plenty?

585
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,459
My daddy thinks
I'm the daughter of Eridia.

586
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:24,185
I can open the vault.

587
00:32:24,287 --> 00:32:25,287
The vault?

588
00:32:25,389 --> 00:32:26,997
That's what this shit is about?

589
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,328
You stole her for yourself.

590
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:33,330
Now, do you know
how many people have died

591
00:32:33,432 --> 00:32:34,337
looking for that hole
in the dirt?

592
00:32:34,439 --> 00:32:36,165
Well, I do.

593
00:32:36,267 --> 00:32:37,599
My mother was one of them.

594
00:32:37,701 --> 00:32:39,675
We have something they don't,
baby girl.

595
00:32:39,777 --> 00:32:41,173
Oh, let me guess. What? Spirit?

596
00:32:41,275 --> 00:32:43,145
Can-do attitude?
The power of friendship?

597
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:45,477
A conscience.

598
00:32:46,442 --> 00:32:47,642
Whatever's in that vault,

599
00:32:47,745 --> 00:32:48,852
a man like Atlas
can never get his hands on it.

600
00:32:48,954 --> 00:32:50,317
- All right, Roland, calm down.
-No!

601
00:32:50,419 --> 00:32:52,683
She's a scumbag bounty hunter
who works for Atlas.

602
00:32:52,785 --> 00:32:55,215
What, and you think your band
of merry heroes can stop him?

603
00:32:55,317 --> 00:32:56,519
Oh, we can try.

604
00:32:56,622 --> 00:32:58,388
We just can't watch our backs
while doing it.

605
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,353
So, do me a favor.
Take your weapon.

606
00:33:00,455 --> 00:33:01,796
Toss it over here.

607
00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:03,562
Grab some supplies, take a walk.

608
00:33:03,664 --> 00:33:07,162
You know, when Atlas finds out
about that party back there,

609
00:33:07,264 --> 00:33:08,434
I'm as good as dead.

610
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:10,436
So, like it or not...

611
00:33:11,775 --> 00:33:12,867
we're on the same side.

612
00:33:22,151 --> 00:33:25,415
A side without an army,
I might add.

613
00:33:25,517 --> 00:33:28,252
So, I hope
you got a better plan than

614
00:33:28,354 --> 00:33:30,291
driving down
a thresher's gullet.

615
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:32,695
No.

616
00:33:32,797 --> 00:33:33,657
But I know someone who does.

617
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,891
A scientist, a vault expert.

618
00:33:36,993 --> 00:33:39,900
It was her idea to break
Tina out and collect the keys.

619
00:33:40,002 --> 00:33:41,669
One key down, two more to go.

620
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:43,634
And, of course, me.

621
00:33:44,509 --> 00:33:45,740
Load up.

622
00:33:45,842 --> 00:33:47,708
Next stop, Sanctuary City.

623
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:48,608
All right!

624
00:33:48,711 --> 00:33:49,841
Road trip!

625
00:33:54,478 --> 00:33:55,349
All right, mask up.

626
00:33:56,722 --> 00:33:57,846
We wanna keep a low profile.

627
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,725
Market clear.

628
00:34:03,827 --> 00:34:04,927
Copy that.

629
00:34:05,063 --> 00:34:06,528
Oh, this place
sure has changed,

630
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,121
for the worse.

631
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:08,923
Back off. Back off!
Heading to Gate 23.

632
00:34:10,502 --> 00:34:11,865
Oh, my.

633
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,295
Who's this handsome devil?

634
00:34:13,397 --> 00:34:14,335
He's a badass killer.

635
00:34:15,733 --> 00:34:18,807
And the reward's
just gone up to 150 grand.

636
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:19,908
Looks like you're not

637
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:21,634
the only one
that's special, kid.

638
00:34:21,736 --> 00:34:23,771
Cannibal frog convention!

639
00:34:23,874 --> 00:34:25,546
Okay, so we're here.

640
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:26,641
Now what?

641
00:34:26,743 --> 00:34:27,783
I need
to locate my contact.

642
00:34:27,885 --> 00:34:29,284
Moxxi will know how to find her.

643
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:30,918
Moxxi?

644
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,248
Yeah. You know her?

645
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,546
Yeah, kind of.

646
00:34:33,648 --> 00:34:35,048
I mean, it's been a while.

647
00:34:35,184 --> 00:34:36,384
Would you be a doll
and hold this? Thank you.

648
00:34:36,486 --> 00:34:38,619
Kriegy! Give me a ride.

649
00:34:38,721 --> 00:34:40,160
Hey.

650
00:34:40,262 --> 00:34:41,597
We're trying to stay low-key.

651
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:43,395
Hey. Did you find

652
00:34:43,497 --> 00:34:45,966
what you were looking for
in Fyrestone?

653
00:34:46,068 --> 00:34:47,495
Never seen you before, stranger.

654
00:34:47,597 --> 00:34:50,904
Nice try, Miss Vladof Infinity.

655
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,899
I never forget a gun.

656
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:56,438
What are you up to now,
Not-A-Vault-Hunter?

657
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,611
She's vault hunting.

658
00:34:58,913 --> 00:35:00,584
I knew it.

659
00:35:00,686 --> 00:35:01,415
I told you, I knew it.

660
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,862
Well, well, well.

661
00:35:13,964 --> 00:35:15,965
Look what the skag dragged in.

662
00:35:16,067 --> 00:35:17,563
-Hey, Mox.
- Get on in there.

663
00:35:18,594 --> 00:35:21,171
Oh, you are most welcome.

664
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:30,845
Milkshake for
my little sugarplum,

665
00:35:30,947 --> 00:35:32,947
and drinks for my friends.

666
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:35,542
I got something to show you.

667
00:35:35,644 --> 00:35:37,653
Everyone, come over here.

668
00:35:37,755 --> 00:35:39,852
Step into my office.

669
00:35:39,954 --> 00:35:40,982
Roland?

670
00:35:42,927 --> 00:35:44,755
- Roland.
-I got it.

671
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,389
Excuse me.

672
00:35:48,491 --> 00:35:49,492
I knew it was you.

673
00:35:49,594 --> 00:35:51,660
- Oh, my God.
-Hey, Larry.

674
00:35:51,762 --> 00:35:53,702
You probably
don't remember me, but

675
00:35:53,804 --> 00:35:55,865
I sure remember you.

676
00:35:57,436 --> 00:35:58,906
Your mama was a good woman.

677
00:35:59,008 --> 00:36:02,036
Yeah, well, wouldn't know.

678
00:36:03,644 --> 00:36:06,183
All right. So,
where is this, uh, scientist?

679
00:36:08,018 --> 00:36:09,545
So, this is where you're headed.

680
00:36:09,647 --> 00:36:11,744
You go all the way
up those stairs

681
00:36:11,846 --> 00:36:14,022
and right there is the elevator.

682
00:36:14,124 --> 00:36:15,724
-Mm-hm.
- Push the button.

683
00:36:15,826 --> 00:36:17,018
Passcode's "ECHO."

684
00:36:17,861 --> 00:36:18,822
- ECHO?
- ECHO.

685
00:36:20,823 --> 00:36:22,496
You sure it's safe
to stay there?

686
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:25,562
Yeah, as long as this one here
don't blow up the joint.

687
00:36:25,664 --> 00:36:27,661
How's that milkshake there,
sugar pie?

688
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,400
Listen.

689
00:36:31,502 --> 00:36:32,638
For whatever it's worth...

690
00:36:33,936 --> 00:36:37,170
I'm real happy
that you came back home.

691
00:36:37,272 --> 00:36:40,116
And I hope that you know
how much your mama loved you.

692
00:36:40,218 --> 00:36:42,577
She always told me
how special you were.

693
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:44,012
You know, I appreciate the help.

694
00:36:45,154 --> 00:36:46,080
Let's just leave it at that.

695
00:36:49,022 --> 00:36:50,357
Right.

696
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:51,589
When they were chasing you,
I was like,

697
00:36:51,691 --> 00:36:52,622
"Hey, don't shoot that guy.
He's my roomie."

698
00:36:52,724 --> 00:36:54,625
- You... You said that?
- Yeah, man.

699
00:36:54,727 --> 00:36:56,827
Hey, you see
your bounty went up?

700
00:36:57,726 --> 00:36:58,700
- My?
- Your bounty.

701
00:36:58,802 --> 00:37:00,133
Get outta here.

702
00:37:00,235 --> 00:37:01,694
Knoxx is on the warpath, stud.

703
00:37:01,796 --> 00:37:03,371
What'd you do to her, man?

704
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:05,637
Man, I kind of... kind of
ghosted her, you know?

705
00:37:05,739 --> 00:37:08,071
Yeah, you did, man.
You ghosted all of us, man.

706
00:37:10,681 --> 00:37:11,413
Yeah.

707
00:37:13,174 --> 00:37:14,950
Anyway, man,
it was really good to see you.

708
00:37:15,052 --> 00:37:16,318
And, you know, you can trust me.

709
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:19,418
We're friends, man.
I'm not gonna tell a soul.

710
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,755
Oh, Larry,
I'm not worried about you.

711
00:37:20,857 --> 00:37:22,089
You're my guy.

712
00:37:22,191 --> 00:37:24,755
You're my main man.

713
00:37:24,857 --> 00:37:26,791
I got a feeling you're not
going to tell anybody.

714
00:37:32,093 --> 00:37:33,630
Is he going to be okay?

715
00:37:33,732 --> 00:37:35,667
Well, he'll have
a hell of a hangover.

716
00:37:35,769 --> 00:37:38,669
Ooh, who knew electricity
provoked defecation?

717
00:37:38,771 --> 00:37:40,233
Hey.

718
00:37:42,113 --> 00:37:42,975
Y'all better
hustle out the back.

719
00:37:43,077 --> 00:37:44,078
Go out this way.

720
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,940
I got these guys. Go on. Go on.

721
00:37:46,042 --> 00:37:48,780
- Claptrap, let's go.
- Go on. Go on. Go on.

722
00:37:48,882 --> 00:37:52,616
Your buddy boy here just drank
about 10 shots too many

723
00:37:52,718 --> 00:37:55,023
then he dropped
like a sack of potatoes.

724
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:57,357
I think you forgot me.

725
00:37:57,459 --> 00:38:01,463
Mm. And a tip
is always appreciated.

726
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,101
All right.

727
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,637
This looks like it.

728
00:38:12,072 --> 00:38:13,310
ECHO.

729
00:38:18,914 --> 00:38:19,910
ECHO?

730
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,050
Sure that's the password?

731
00:38:22,152 --> 00:38:24,420
Maybe you gotta echo the "ECHO."

732
00:38:25,152 --> 00:38:26,888
ECHO. ECHO.

733
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,083
All right.

734
00:38:31,055 --> 00:38:33,162
You fools would literally
be dead without me.

735
00:38:33,264 --> 00:38:34,896
- You need me.
-Here we go.

736
00:38:34,998 --> 00:38:36,727
Come on, Claptrap.

737
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,197
Where are we going?
Up.

738
00:38:47,102 --> 00:38:48,672
So, you trust
this woman?

739
00:38:48,774 --> 00:38:51,011
She's a xeno-archaeologist,
all right?

740
00:38:51,113 --> 00:38:52,841
She's a little odd.

741
00:38:52,943 --> 00:38:54,709
But she knows everything
about the vault.

742
00:38:54,811 --> 00:38:57,151
So, if she says something weird,

743
00:38:57,253 --> 00:38:58,649
don't let it get to you, okay?

744
00:38:58,751 --> 00:39:00,989
I am 10
to the 100th power

745
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:02,722
impressed with this place.

746
00:39:03,919 --> 00:39:05,885
Cool.

747
00:39:05,987 --> 00:39:07,862
Oh! I see you have the girl.

748
00:39:07,964 --> 00:39:09,264
That's right.

749
00:39:09,366 --> 00:39:10,829
Did you find
a vault key, too?

750
00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:13,934
Hi, I'm Tina.

751
00:39:14,036 --> 00:39:15,328
The special one.

752
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:16,967
Huh.

753
00:39:19,877 --> 00:39:20,872
Tannis.

754
00:39:31,854 --> 00:39:32,587
Oh.

755
00:39:33,858 --> 00:39:35,315
Hello, Lilith.

756
00:39:37,395 --> 00:39:38,989
Okay, good.
So you guys know each other.

757
00:39:39,897 --> 00:39:40,925
Unfortunately.

758
00:39:42,033 --> 00:39:43,664
I'm not staying here.

759
00:39:44,802 --> 00:39:45,767
What?

760
00:39:45,869 --> 00:39:47,533
Okay.

761
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,362
But you all smell
like thresher urine.

762
00:39:49,464 --> 00:39:51,869
And your wanted poster
just went up all over town.

763
00:39:51,971 --> 00:39:54,805
So, I suggest that you all
settle in and clean up.

764
00:39:54,907 --> 00:39:57,144
Now, the electroshower
is right over there.

765
00:39:57,246 --> 00:39:58,480
Ooh, shower.

766
00:39:58,582 --> 00:40:00,448
Hey, kids,
we're out of here. Let's go.

767
00:40:00,551 --> 00:40:02,108
Lilith? Hey, I get it.
There's history here.

768
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:03,712
I don't even need
to know what it is.

769
00:40:03,814 --> 00:40:05,247
The point is that she's right.

770
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:06,781
If there's a poster of me,
that means there's one of you.

771
00:40:06,883 --> 00:40:08,082
They're looking for all of us.

772
00:40:08,218 --> 00:40:08,957
I hate to say it,
but we don't have a choice.

773
00:40:09,059 --> 00:40:10,086
We gotta sit tight.

774
00:40:12,053 --> 00:40:13,721
Lilith, we don't have a choice.

775
00:40:13,823 --> 00:40:15,230
What is happening, Tannis?

776
00:40:15,332 --> 00:40:16,956
-Electroshower.
- Wait.

777
00:40:17,058 --> 00:40:18,801
Wait, guys.

778
00:40:20,195 --> 00:40:22,364
-Time to shower.
- Claptrap.

779
00:40:22,466 --> 00:40:23,906
♪ It's time for showering
Showering, time for some... ♪

780
00:40:24,008 --> 00:40:25,240
That's not... No.

781
00:40:25,342 --> 00:40:27,367
Claptrap.

782
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,511
Rebooting.

783
00:40:31,613 --> 00:40:32,746
Everybody,
just settle down, please.

784
00:40:33,742 --> 00:40:34,781
Settle down.

785
00:40:35,779 --> 00:40:37,011
Hey, hey! Settle down.

786
00:40:37,113 --> 00:40:38,244
Square root of 929,000...

787
00:40:38,413 --> 00:40:40,088
I am basing my assumption
that you're upset

788
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,323
on your body language.

789
00:40:42,425 --> 00:40:44,560
Perceptive as ever, I see.

790
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:49,730
Because of your mother?

791
00:40:50,431 --> 00:40:52,799
Uh, no, because of you.

792
00:40:54,071 --> 00:40:55,505
She trusted you...

793
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:58,970
to take care of me.

794
00:41:00,144 --> 00:41:01,478
But you ran back here

795
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:05,977
to chase after that mystical
Eridian vault bullshit.

796
00:41:07,251 --> 00:41:08,947
I left you with tradespeople.

797
00:41:10,315 --> 00:41:11,882
Oh.

798
00:41:11,984 --> 00:41:14,055
Yes. You mean
the murderers and thieves

799
00:41:14,157 --> 00:41:15,448
on the mining ship.

800
00:41:16,293 --> 00:41:17,824
It's what your mother wanted.

801
00:41:19,089 --> 00:41:21,029
She wanted me
to learn how to kill

802
00:41:21,131 --> 00:41:22,359
by the age of 10?

803
00:41:22,461 --> 00:41:24,290
How to survive.

804
00:41:24,392 --> 00:41:26,366
I had to come back here
to finish her work.

805
00:41:26,468 --> 00:41:28,230
She believed the Eridian vault

806
00:41:28,332 --> 00:41:30,571
had the power to change things
for the better and...

807
00:41:30,673 --> 00:41:33,334
She traded her daughter
for a waste of time.

808
00:41:50,995 --> 00:41:52,155
Go back inside.

809
00:41:53,195 --> 00:41:54,223
It's not safe.

810
00:41:55,298 --> 00:41:56,566
I can look after myself.

811
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,063
Told you I'm special.

812
00:42:00,136 --> 00:42:01,230
Aren't we all?

813
00:42:02,137 --> 00:42:03,369
Yeah.

814
00:42:03,471 --> 00:42:04,840
They made me that way.

815
00:42:04,943 --> 00:42:06,070
Made you?

816
00:42:07,276 --> 00:42:08,501
What do you mean?

817
00:42:11,139 --> 00:42:12,914
Your father is Deukalian Atlas,

818
00:42:13,017 --> 00:42:14,247
isn't he?

819
00:42:14,349 --> 00:42:16,284
Yes and no.

820
00:42:16,386 --> 00:42:19,118
Not a "yes or no" question.

821
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,590
He's...

822
00:42:22,025 --> 00:42:22,922
my...

823
00:42:25,028 --> 00:42:26,728
creator.

824
00:42:28,292 --> 00:42:32,633
Atlas is bananapants obsessed
with the vault.

825
00:42:32,736 --> 00:42:36,569
He says only a daughter
of Eridia can open it.

826
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:38,102
He found a piece
of the vault key,

827
00:42:40,034 --> 00:42:41,802
and on that piece

828
00:42:41,904 --> 00:42:44,009
was a tiny bit...

829
00:42:44,983 --> 00:42:45,948
of blood.

830
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:47,716
Eridian blood.

831
00:42:49,253 --> 00:42:50,450
He cloned an Eridian.

832
00:42:50,552 --> 00:42:52,952
And guess who that Eridian is?

833
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:56,087
Hmm. Is her name Tina?

834
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:57,792
Boom.

835
00:42:59,163 --> 00:43:01,153
But it's all good.

836
00:43:01,255 --> 00:43:04,466
I don't care I grew up in a lab.

837
00:43:04,568 --> 00:43:06,961
I never wanted
a mother or a father.

838
00:43:07,063 --> 00:43:10,436
He created you to open a vault.

839
00:43:10,538 --> 00:43:12,770
God, what an asshole.

840
00:43:12,872 --> 00:43:14,710
That's an understatement.

841
00:43:16,173 --> 00:43:18,807
He'll use whatever
technology's inside

842
00:43:18,909 --> 00:43:20,408
and make superweapons.

843
00:43:21,385 --> 00:43:23,752
The dude's got major issues.

844
00:43:25,554 --> 00:43:27,954
I'm just a product to Atlas.

845
00:43:29,225 --> 00:43:30,183
If he gets me,

846
00:43:30,285 --> 00:43:32,057
he's gonna make me
open the vault.

847
00:43:33,765 --> 00:43:35,995
Then he's just gonna lock me up
into another secret lab

848
00:43:37,026 --> 00:43:37,931
and do more experiments.

849
00:43:39,637 --> 00:43:41,104
And if you saw
the things they did

850
00:43:41,206 --> 00:43:42,204
to the other clones...

851
00:43:42,306 --> 00:43:43,805
He's not gonna find you.

852
00:43:57,288 --> 00:43:59,117
Yo! Whassup?

853
00:44:00,057 --> 00:44:01,355
Yeah!

854
00:44:01,457 --> 00:44:03,292
Hey, there, sugar chips.

855
00:44:03,394 --> 00:44:04,821
You need a firmware update?

856
00:44:04,923 --> 00:44:06,385
Piss off, short stuff.

857
00:44:06,487 --> 00:44:08,093
Someone needs
an oil change.

858
00:44:10,632 --> 00:44:13,866
My daddy always had a saying.

859
00:44:13,969 --> 00:44:17,063
Never trust a man
who can't hold his liquor.

860
00:44:17,165 --> 00:44:18,535
She tased me, all right?

861
00:44:18,637 --> 00:44:19,866
I love alcohol.

862
00:44:19,968 --> 00:44:20,969
I can be wild.

863
00:44:21,071 --> 00:44:22,335
As for that little girl,

864
00:44:22,437 --> 00:44:24,579
you don't think
the second I saw her,

865
00:44:24,681 --> 00:44:26,072
I wouldn't hand her
right over to you

866
00:44:26,174 --> 00:44:27,216
just to get rid of you?

867
00:44:27,318 --> 00:44:28,541
I admire the fight,

868
00:44:28,643 --> 00:44:30,543
but let me take you through
what happens next.

869
00:44:30,645 --> 00:44:32,149
Spare parts!
We seal the city...

870
00:44:32,251 --> 00:44:34,088
Anyone got
spare parts that I can use?

871
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:34,955
Uh-oh.

872
00:44:36,361 --> 00:44:37,390
Hey, hey, that's his robot.

873
00:44:37,492 --> 00:44:38,692
It's an old CL4P...

874
00:44:38,794 --> 00:44:39,892
Excuse me.
Coming through.

875
00:44:39,994 --> 00:44:41,731
Got a computer virus.
Highly contagious.

876
00:44:43,157 --> 00:44:44,192
Clear the street!

877
00:44:44,294 --> 00:44:45,499
You,
down on the ground.

878
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:46,659
Move, move, move!

879
00:44:49,136 --> 00:44:51,372
Now that we have
Tina and the first key,

880
00:44:51,474 --> 00:44:52,808
I wanna show you this.

881
00:44:54,612 --> 00:44:56,905
This is a mining journal
left behind

882
00:44:57,007 --> 00:44:58,273
by a corporate bureaucrat.

883
00:44:58,376 --> 00:45:00,248
He cataloged everything
the miners brought in,

884
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:01,447
most of it useless.

885
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:03,984
But on this page...

886
00:45:08,687 --> 00:45:10,254
Another key.

887
00:45:10,356 --> 00:45:13,255
He thought it was a useless
piece of Eridian pottery.

888
00:45:13,357 --> 00:45:15,891
He had no clue
they'd found a vault key.

889
00:45:15,993 --> 00:45:17,423
That makes two of three.

890
00:45:17,525 --> 00:45:19,192
So,
if this is the second key,

891
00:45:19,294 --> 00:45:21,196
why don't you already have it?

892
00:45:21,298 --> 00:45:23,531
Because the mine
is in Caustic Caverns.

893
00:45:24,175 --> 00:45:26,034
Oh, shit.

894
00:45:26,136 --> 00:45:27,975
Danger! Red alert!

895
00:45:28,077 --> 00:45:30,270
People, we need to move!
The soldiers, they're coming!

896
00:45:30,372 --> 00:45:31,404
They have guns!
They're shooting!

897
00:45:31,506 --> 00:45:32,478
- They're firing!
- Clappy, slow your roll.

898
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,880
What is the dealio?

899
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:36,476
The soldier woman
who really hates Roland,

900
00:45:36,578 --> 00:45:39,051
which suggests
the two of them had some...

901
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,151
- Come on, get to the point.
- She was at the bar

902
00:45:41,253 --> 00:45:43,225
interrogating Moxxi
and your friend Larry...

903
00:45:43,327 --> 00:45:44,283
Was that his name?

904
00:45:44,385 --> 00:45:45,987
Seemed like a decent roommate.

905
00:45:46,089 --> 00:45:47,289
Did they see you?

906
00:45:47,392 --> 00:45:50,599
Do you promise
not to be angry if I say yes?

907
00:45:50,701 --> 00:45:53,102
Lance units,
block all exits.

908
00:45:53,204 --> 00:45:55,338
No one leaves.

909
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,105
Get this thing out of here.

910
00:45:57,208 --> 00:45:58,638
Masks off.

911
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,142
Of course, Commander.

912
00:46:00,244 --> 00:46:02,241
Of course. Hey!

913
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:05,506
Double-perched custom Blaster
with ionized projectiles.

914
00:46:05,608 --> 00:46:08,117
That'll outpace any
bone shredder on Pandora.

915
00:46:08,219 --> 00:46:09,178
You wanna trade?

916
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,949
I'll give you
special price, huh?

917
00:46:11,051 --> 00:46:14,581
Sanctuary
is now on lockdown.

918
00:46:14,683 --> 00:46:17,256
No one goes anywhere
until we find that robot.

919
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:20,621
Is there any way out of here
that doesn't involve garbage?

920
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:22,997
Um...

921
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,158
No.

922
00:46:46,487 --> 00:46:47,521
What?

923
00:46:47,623 --> 00:46:48,649
Did you guys wanna use it?

924
00:46:52,787 --> 00:46:56,157
The entrance is underneath
all of that debris.

925
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,163
Under there.

926
00:47:00,328 --> 00:47:03,131
Whoo! Look what I got!

927
00:47:03,233 --> 00:47:04,634
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

928
00:47:04,736 --> 00:47:05,699
Open it.

929
00:47:10,742 --> 00:47:12,539
Hello.

930
00:47:12,641 --> 00:47:14,343
Would you
look at that? A ladder.

931
00:47:14,445 --> 00:47:16,584
Unfortunately,
my design doesn't facilitate

932
00:47:16,686 --> 00:47:18,252
this type of vertical travel.

933
00:47:18,354 --> 00:47:19,345
Drats.

934
00:47:19,447 --> 00:47:20,890
Guess I'll just...

935
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,693
Well...

936
00:47:24,795 --> 00:47:26,324
- Destiny awaits.
-I'm fine!

937
00:47:28,191 --> 00:47:30,425
Mm! Meat soup.

938
00:47:30,527 --> 00:47:33,166
Chemical waste
from the mining equipment.

939
00:47:33,268 --> 00:47:35,496
It's corrosive enough
to dissolve almost anything

940
00:47:35,598 --> 00:47:37,038
except the natural crystals
in this cavern.

941
00:47:38,434 --> 00:47:40,873
How are we gonna
get through this?

942
00:47:40,975 --> 00:47:43,240
Well, it's not gonna
be that way.

943
00:47:43,342 --> 00:47:45,246
Looks like we gotta
take the high road.

944
00:47:45,348 --> 00:47:47,045
Krieg.

945
00:47:47,147 --> 00:47:48,575
Let's see if we can
grab this here.

946
00:47:48,677 --> 00:47:50,618
Luckily,
my wheel's too large,

947
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,380
so I'll just watch you all melt

948
00:47:52,482 --> 00:47:53,813
from a safe
and reasonable distance.

949
00:47:56,057 --> 00:47:58,053
You are small enough
to get in there.

950
00:47:58,155 --> 00:47:59,522
Head through the tunnel,

951
00:47:59,624 --> 00:48:01,929
locate the main access control
panel and then unlock

952
00:48:02,031 --> 00:48:03,599
- the door at the end.
-Can do!

953
00:48:03,701 --> 00:48:05,364
- Quietly.
-No problem.

954
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:07,593
I wouldn't want anything bad
to happen to each one of you

955
00:48:07,695 --> 00:48:09,537
in the most
horrifying way possible.

956
00:48:09,639 --> 00:48:12,068
All right, I'll go first.

957
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:14,301
- I got this.
- No, I got it.

958
00:48:14,403 --> 00:48:15,635
- I got it.
-Tina!

959
00:48:15,738 --> 00:48:17,412
Coming through!
Hey, hey.

960
00:48:17,514 --> 00:48:18,545
Relax.

961
00:48:18,647 --> 00:48:19,579
I'm the lightest.

962
00:48:19,681 --> 00:48:21,181
- Tina!
- Hey!

963
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:29,684
Ladies first.

964
00:48:30,758 --> 00:48:32,060
Don't mind if I do.

965
00:48:42,672 --> 00:48:43,632
- You all right?
- Mm-hmm.

966
00:48:46,201 --> 00:48:47,276
Be careful.

967
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,253
Guys.

968
00:48:58,355 --> 00:48:59,087
Look.

969
00:49:07,394 --> 00:49:10,258
Hope blooms
in the strangest places.

970
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,325
It's kind of pretty.

971
00:49:11,427 --> 00:49:12,501
Mission accomplished!

972
00:49:12,603 --> 00:49:14,364
The door is unlocked.

973
00:49:14,466 --> 00:49:15,904
♪ Who's the best?
I'm the best ♪

974
00:49:16,006 --> 00:49:17,639
♪ Give me a job
I pass the test ♪

975
00:49:17,741 --> 00:49:18,538
Can't take him anywhere.

976
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,638
Well?

977
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:20,735
You're welcome.

978
00:49:21,877 --> 00:49:24,139
Impossible to please.

979
00:49:35,659 --> 00:49:37,458
Scream showers.

980
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,025
It's Bloodshots.

981
00:49:39,127 --> 00:49:40,624
Yeah, their symbols
are everywhere.

982
00:49:40,726 --> 00:49:44,699
These are the Psychos
other psychos are afraid of.

983
00:49:44,801 --> 00:49:46,561
They're probably still here.

984
00:49:46,663 --> 00:49:48,327
- Let's go find out.
-  No bombs.

985
00:49:48,429 --> 00:49:49,838
I'll be surgical.

986
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:51,832
There's only one of you
in the world...

987
00:49:53,676 --> 00:49:54,703
and you're special.

988
00:49:57,609 --> 00:49:59,480
You guys sit tight.
Wait for us to come back.

989
00:49:59,582 --> 00:50:00,676
Come on, Lil.

990
00:50:17,867 --> 00:50:19,662
Dealt with Bloodshots before?

991
00:50:20,504 --> 00:50:21,494
Once.

992
00:50:21,596 --> 00:50:22,735
How'd you make it out?

993
00:50:22,837 --> 00:50:24,940
Kind words and hugs?

994
00:50:25,042 --> 00:50:25,904
I don't know what it is
that happens to 'em

995
00:50:26,006 --> 00:50:27,604
when they're down here

996
00:50:27,706 --> 00:50:29,309
but it's like they get hit
with an extra dose of crazy.

997
00:50:35,217 --> 00:50:36,976
Strip the flesh,
salt the wound!

998
00:50:40,156 --> 00:50:42,350
- There's too many to shoot.
- Or blow up?

999
00:50:42,452 --> 00:50:44,057
Well, we can't really blend in.

1000
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:45,561
We don't look
anything like them.

1001
00:50:45,663 --> 00:50:46,924
Except you, handsome.

1002
00:50:47,026 --> 00:50:48,964
Thank you!

1003
00:50:49,067 --> 00:50:50,427
Well,
according to my calculations,

1004
00:50:50,529 --> 00:50:51,765
the odds of a successful
stealth operation

1005
00:50:51,867 --> 00:50:53,168
in this scenario is...

1006
00:50:53,899 --> 00:50:55,768
0%? Wow!

1007
00:50:55,870 --> 00:50:57,470
You never see that!

1008
00:50:57,572 --> 00:50:59,906
Well, I guess that's it then.
Back to the truck, right?

1009
00:51:00,008 --> 00:51:01,475
Did you factor in a distraction?

1010
00:51:01,578 --> 00:51:02,942
Of course.

1011
00:51:03,044 --> 00:51:04,308
I analyzed 16 million versions

1012
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:05,744
where one of you
creates a distraction.

1013
00:51:05,846 --> 00:51:07,373
Total failure.

1014
00:51:07,475 --> 00:51:09,882
No, not one of us.

1015
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:11,320
Wait, who else is...?

1016
00:51:11,422 --> 00:51:12,922
Oh, no.

1017
00:51:18,729 --> 00:51:21,388
Coming through.

1018
00:51:23,491 --> 00:51:24,232
Hi, there.

1019
00:51:25,063 --> 00:51:26,300
How you doing?

1020
00:51:29,569 --> 00:51:31,767
Just a little nervous laughter
to crack the ice.

1021
00:51:32,841 --> 00:51:34,602
Shiny!

1022
00:51:34,704 --> 00:51:36,304
Just rolling through town

1023
00:51:36,406 --> 00:51:37,773
looking for a good time.

1024
00:51:41,444 --> 00:51:42,750
Ladies and gentlemen!

1025
00:51:42,852 --> 00:51:44,582
Your attention, please.

1026
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:49,122
I am here because I want to be

1027
00:51:49,224 --> 00:51:50,649
and not for a more
justifiable reason

1028
00:51:50,751 --> 00:51:52,321
like trying to be a distraction.

1029
00:51:52,423 --> 00:51:54,259
Even though it makes no sense

1030
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,797
for me to say
what I'm about to say,

1031
00:51:55,899 --> 00:51:57,495
and even though anyone rational

1032
00:51:57,597 --> 00:51:59,699
would suspect it was just
part of a crude plan,

1033
00:51:59,801 --> 00:52:00,970
I have decided

1034
00:52:01,072 --> 00:52:04,336
entirely on my own
to say the following.

1035
00:52:04,438 --> 00:52:07,966
Y'all bitches
need to eat your own butts

1036
00:52:08,069 --> 00:52:09,309
with your poopy-mouth...

1037
00:52:09,411 --> 00:52:11,640
...ass-faces until you die
from loser poisoning

1038
00:52:11,742 --> 00:52:15,443
like the stupid
pus-crotches that you is.

1039
00:52:19,753 --> 00:52:21,889
Was that too much?
It was too much, wasn't it?

1040
00:52:21,991 --> 00:52:23,386
What took it over the edge?

1041
00:52:23,488 --> 00:52:24,754
Was it the
"poopy-mouth ass-faces"?

1042
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:27,757
Stairs. Come on!

1043
00:52:33,565 --> 00:52:35,127
Not in the undercarriage!

1044
00:52:37,136 --> 00:52:38,174
My programming...

1045
00:52:40,768 --> 00:52:41,809
Oh, that's gonna leave a mark.

1046
00:52:43,847 --> 00:52:45,473
Son of a... You got me!

1047
00:52:45,575 --> 00:52:46,813
Okay, I'm dead. How about that?

1048
00:52:51,856 --> 00:52:53,145
Is he going to be all right?

1049
00:52:59,654 --> 00:53:01,888
Excellent plan.

1050
00:53:01,991 --> 00:53:04,299
Who would have guessed
they'd shoot me, right?

1051
00:53:05,968 --> 00:53:07,027
Well, we survived.

1052
00:53:08,937 --> 00:53:10,536
So much for your 0%.

1053
00:53:11,975 --> 00:53:13,737
You're not out yet.

1054
00:53:15,837 --> 00:53:17,136
I think
the key's in here.

1055
00:53:20,047 --> 00:53:21,346
Sweet.

1056
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,846
So, the key
is in one of these crates.

1057
00:53:24,853 --> 00:53:25,848
One of these

1058
00:53:26,856 --> 00:53:29,024
kabillion crates.

1059
00:53:29,126 --> 00:53:31,556
Yeah, this is gonna
take a minute.

1060
00:53:31,658 --> 00:53:32,792
Four days
if you work around the clock

1061
00:53:32,894 --> 00:53:34,394
which you can't,

1062
00:53:34,496 --> 00:53:36,597
because your bodies
require rest every 16 hours.

1063
00:53:36,699 --> 00:53:37,891
Lazy!

1064
00:53:37,993 --> 00:53:40,032
Not if those psycho Raiders
find us first.

1065
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:42,202
Those are Bloodshots.

1066
00:53:42,304 --> 00:53:43,762
Raiders live above.
Not down here.

1067
00:53:43,864 --> 00:53:45,271
There are no Raiders down here.

1068
00:53:45,373 --> 00:53:46,702
Tannis, nobody's talking
about Raiders.

1069
00:53:46,805 --> 00:53:48,143
What's the big deal
about Raiders?

1070
00:53:48,245 --> 00:53:49,374
I know,
but you brought up Raiders.

1071
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,079
How about
we forget about it?

1072
00:53:51,181 --> 00:53:52,045
Am I missing
something here?

1073
00:53:52,147 --> 00:53:53,410
But I don't understand.

1074
00:53:53,512 --> 00:53:54,475
Forget about
the Raiders!

1075
00:53:54,577 --> 00:53:55,713
Just forget about it.

1076
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:57,748
I'm sorry.

1077
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:35,248
I understand...

1078
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:37,259
- Bloodshots are down here.
- You keep bringing up Raiders.

1079
00:54:37,361 --> 00:54:38,927
- Tannis, I swear to God...
-I found it.

1080
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:40,994
- What?
-The second key.

1081
00:54:41,096 --> 00:54:42,922
How... How did...?

1082
00:54:43,024 --> 00:54:45,433
I don't know.
Just lucky, I guess.

1083
00:54:47,403 --> 00:54:48,695
Yeah, we'll see
how lucky you are.

1084
00:54:48,797 --> 00:54:50,004
We still gotta get out of here.

1085
00:54:50,106 --> 00:54:51,705
There's an exit portal this way.

1086
00:54:51,807 --> 00:54:52,638
Come on.

1087
00:54:57,037 --> 00:54:57,940
Shh!

1088
00:54:59,708 --> 00:55:00,613
What's that?

1089
00:55:06,157 --> 00:55:08,082
What? I'm expelling
the excess lead.

1090
00:55:10,327 --> 00:55:12,026
Big bullet. Big bullet coming.
There we go.

1091
00:55:12,128 --> 00:55:13,191
Can't you do this another time?

1092
00:55:13,293 --> 00:55:14,795
This has to happen now.

1093
00:55:14,897 --> 00:55:17,164
Don't judge me.

1094
00:55:20,236 --> 00:55:21,165
What?
How is this funny?

1095
00:55:21,267 --> 00:55:22,567
You keep it down.

1096
00:55:22,669 --> 00:55:23,998
Do I judge you
when you blast out a loaf?

1097
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,341
- We don't wanna attract...
-Look out!

1098
00:55:30,311 --> 00:55:31,476
A little help?

1099
00:55:32,778 --> 00:55:33,808
Incoming!

1100
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:35,884
Go, go!
Okay, going now!

1101
00:56:00,877 --> 00:56:01,872
Tannis!

1102
00:56:03,704 --> 00:56:04,479
Thank you.

1103
00:56:05,345 --> 00:56:06,580
On your left!

1104
00:56:07,046 --> 00:56:08,043
Wow!

1105
00:56:17,688 --> 00:56:18,691
Come here, girlie!

1106
00:56:28,367 --> 00:56:29,771
What are you doing?

1107
00:56:29,873 --> 00:56:30,962
I needed a gun.

1108
00:56:31,064 --> 00:56:33,136
So you ask for it, Tannis. Ask!

1109
00:56:33,238 --> 00:56:34,601
Move!

1110
00:56:43,051 --> 00:56:44,343
That way!

1111
00:56:46,885 --> 00:56:48,947
We've got this, guys!

1112
00:56:49,049 --> 00:56:50,659
There's nothing we can't do!

1113
00:56:50,761 --> 00:56:51,751
Stairs!

1114
00:56:51,853 --> 00:56:52,893
Krieg, help me! I'm not...

1115
00:56:52,995 --> 00:56:53,792
Go, go!

1116
00:57:08,704 --> 00:57:09,743
Lilith, I got you!

1117
00:57:09,845 --> 00:57:10,875
Go!

1118
00:57:15,282 --> 00:57:16,276
Roland!

1119
00:57:18,856 --> 00:57:19,818
Watch out!

1120
00:57:20,758 --> 00:57:21,490
Go, go!

1121
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:33,568
Time to go.

1122
00:57:40,643 --> 00:57:42,208
I'm sure
we're past the hard part.

1123
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:43,402
Okay.

1124
00:57:51,322 --> 00:57:52,752
Go, go, go!
We gotta move!

1125
00:57:58,087 --> 00:58:00,691
Let go of me!
Tina!

1126
00:58:00,793 --> 00:58:02,721
Lilith!
Hello!

1127
00:58:09,338 --> 00:58:10,471
Follow me this way.

1128
00:58:10,573 --> 00:58:11,971
I have a tremendous
sense of direction.

1129
00:58:12,073 --> 00:58:13,041
Oh, God!

1130
00:58:27,157 --> 00:58:27,886
Help me!

1131
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:34,321
Krieg, spin me!

1132
00:58:35,529 --> 00:58:36,756
I found it! I found it!

1133
00:58:36,858 --> 00:58:37,858
There's an elevator!

1134
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,733
Follow me. This way. Come on.

1135
00:58:41,328 --> 00:58:44,099
- Roland!
-Clappy, go! Go! Go!

1136
00:58:44,201 --> 00:58:45,805
Lilith!
Don't leave me behind again!

1137
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:51,811
There's a service elevator
this way!

1138
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,781
It's up here.

1139
00:58:56,883 --> 00:58:59,745
- This way. Oh, no.
-Go! Go, go, go!

1140
00:58:59,847 --> 00:59:00,950
Shit!

1141
00:59:01,052 --> 00:59:02,747
This is gonna take some time.
Hold this.

1142
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:03,859
Claptrap!

1143
00:59:03,961 --> 00:59:05,283
I need help!

1144
00:59:05,385 --> 00:59:07,218
Uh,
in front of everyone?

1145
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,426
Yes!
Look away!

1146
00:59:08,528 --> 00:59:10,791
Look away! I command you!

1147
00:59:10,893 --> 00:59:12,056
Krieg, we got company.

1148
00:59:12,158 --> 00:59:14,796
It's time to bleed!

1149
00:59:14,898 --> 00:59:16,066
- Come on!
- I am trying!

1150
00:59:20,043 --> 00:59:21,106
Krieg, wait!

1151
00:59:21,208 --> 00:59:22,402
Krieg!

1152
00:59:34,256 --> 00:59:35,413
It's not working.

1153
00:59:35,515 --> 00:59:36,955
Aren't you supposed
to be smart?

1154
00:59:42,094 --> 00:59:43,297
I'll turn you
into a meat bicycle!

1155
00:59:43,399 --> 00:59:44,523
Another victim!

1156
00:59:55,244 --> 00:59:56,469
Thanks, kid.

1157
01:00:04,945 --> 01:00:06,620
Tannis!

1158
01:00:06,722 --> 01:00:08,151
- How we doing?
-I don't have it!

1159
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:14,421
Come here,
give me a kiss!

1160
01:00:17,299 --> 01:00:18,832
Krieg! Pull back!

1161
01:00:29,276 --> 01:00:32,270
Go! Go!

1162
01:00:32,372 --> 01:00:34,243
I regret everything!

1163
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:43,316
Come on!

1164
01:00:43,418 --> 01:00:45,191
-We gotta go.
- It's not working.

1165
01:00:45,293 --> 01:00:46,024
Go, Tannis.

1166
01:00:47,562 --> 01:00:49,357
We have another wiring problem.

1167
01:00:50,431 --> 01:00:51,494
Baby!

1168
01:00:53,961 --> 01:00:54,703
Shit.

1169
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:58,537
- Roland, what are you doing?
-Fixing it.

1170
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,033
- Get back here!
-Hey.

1171
01:01:00,135 --> 01:01:01,776
No. Please don't.

1172
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,471
- Roland!
- Hey, Tina.

1173
01:01:06,449 --> 01:01:07,606
I'll meet you at the vault.

1174
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:09,212
I promise.

1175
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:12,314
Tannis.

1176
01:01:13,455 --> 01:01:14,954
- Hit it!
- Okay, hitting!

1177
01:01:19,194 --> 01:01:20,190
Roland!

1178
01:01:26,499 --> 01:01:28,226
All right, Bob.

1179
01:01:28,328 --> 01:01:30,338
You ready to kick some ass?

1180
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,371
I knew you'd say that.

1181
01:02:12,047 --> 01:02:14,409
The brakes are out!
We are not slowing down!

1182
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:16,675
We are not gonna make it!

1183
01:02:28,022 --> 01:02:29,663
Teleportation.

1184
01:02:29,765 --> 01:02:31,563
I can move stuff
with my mind, y'all.

1185
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:32,630
We're not dead?

1186
01:02:32,732 --> 01:02:34,432
I'm still enslaved? Drats.

1187
01:02:36,103 --> 01:02:38,399
Chutney vomit queen.
Ew! Yuck!

1188
01:02:38,501 --> 01:02:40,967
I think the teleportation
has made her quite ill.

1189
01:02:41,069 --> 01:02:42,308
How did you do that?

1190
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:43,971
I don't know.

1191
01:02:44,073 --> 01:02:45,943
Just kind of happened.

1192
01:02:46,045 --> 01:02:48,008
Hey, Roland's
gonna be okay, right?

1193
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:49,442
He's an elite soldier.

1194
01:02:49,544 --> 01:02:51,820
If anyone can get out of that,
it's him.

1195
01:02:54,284 --> 01:02:55,522
Where are we?

1196
01:02:55,624 --> 01:02:57,857
I can't get a read on ECHOnet.

1197
01:02:57,959 --> 01:03:00,156
But it looks like
we're in an old mine.

1198
01:03:00,258 --> 01:03:02,655
Maybe we find
some shelter inside.

1199
01:03:26,721 --> 01:03:28,320
I've combined the keys.

1200
01:03:28,422 --> 01:03:29,418
Look.

1201
01:03:33,423 --> 01:03:35,188
What's that?
Some kind of a map?

1202
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:36,689
Incredible, isn't it?

1203
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,131
It isn't just a key.

1204
01:03:41,437 --> 01:03:42,664
And right there...

1205
01:03:42,767 --> 01:03:43,971
The vault?

1206
01:03:45,332 --> 01:03:46,366
It is a shame

1207
01:03:46,468 --> 01:03:48,140
your mother is not here
to see this.

1208
01:03:49,645 --> 01:03:51,509
It was there the whole time.

1209
01:03:51,611 --> 01:03:52,912
Apparently.

1210
01:03:53,014 --> 01:03:54,480
I've seen that
before somewhere.

1211
01:03:54,582 --> 01:03:55,848
Firehawk.

1212
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:58,711
Eridian goddess,
protector of the planet.

1213
01:04:02,993 --> 01:04:06,158
Well, it's all a bit pointless
without the third piece.

1214
01:04:07,288 --> 01:04:08,457
Oh, well, we have it.

1215
01:04:12,533 --> 01:04:14,259
She's the key.

1216
01:04:14,361 --> 01:04:16,096
The elevator confirmed it.

1217
01:04:16,198 --> 01:04:17,604
That was a phasewalk.

1218
01:04:17,706 --> 01:04:19,240
Only an Eridian could do that.

1219
01:04:19,342 --> 01:04:20,398
Wait a minute.

1220
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:21,608
If she's a piece of the key,

1221
01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:23,069
what happens when she opens it?

1222
01:04:23,171 --> 01:04:24,374
I assumed you knew.

1223
01:04:25,681 --> 01:04:27,045
Did your mother never tell you?

1224
01:04:27,148 --> 01:04:29,608
I was eight. I can barely
remember her face.

1225
01:04:29,710 --> 01:04:32,611
When the daughter of Eridia
places the key,

1226
01:04:32,713 --> 01:04:34,846
the pieces are consumed
and the vault opens.

1227
01:04:37,390 --> 01:04:41,124
Now, I don't necessarily
believe that means kill her.

1228
01:04:41,226 --> 01:04:42,694
But you're prepared
to take that risk.

1229
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:44,361
Well, we have no choice.

1230
01:04:45,226 --> 01:04:46,762
Either we take her

1231
01:04:46,864 --> 01:04:48,233
or Atlas does.

1232
01:04:50,368 --> 01:04:52,270
There is no salvation
without sacrifice.

1233
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:06,878
Worst orgy ever.

1234
01:05:19,667 --> 01:05:20,760
Rest in peace, Bob.

1235
01:05:31,843 --> 01:05:33,912
Oh, shit.

1236
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:47,787
Whoa. Sorry.

1237
01:05:47,889 --> 01:05:49,663
I thought for a moment there
you had rigor mortis.

1238
01:05:49,765 --> 01:05:51,191
It was a really nice moment.

1239
01:05:51,293 --> 01:05:52,966
I'll treasure it always.

1240
01:05:53,068 --> 01:05:55,162
Also, I scavenged
the final parts I needed

1241
01:05:55,264 --> 01:05:56,696
from a dead transformer,

1242
01:05:56,798 --> 01:05:59,733
and fixed the thing
you so recklessly destroyed.

1243
01:06:10,786 --> 01:06:12,451
You didn't press this, did you?

1244
01:06:12,554 --> 01:06:14,283
I did not.

1245
01:06:14,385 --> 01:06:15,947
I can crush it again
if you'd like.

1246
01:06:17,621 --> 01:06:20,158
Oh, "Thank you, Claptrap.
You're indispensable."

1247
01:06:20,261 --> 01:06:23,163
Thank you, Lilith.
Your praise warms my soul.

1248
01:06:46,686 --> 01:06:47,682
Lilith.

1249
01:06:49,355 --> 01:06:51,026
Have you broken the beacon
I gave you?

1250
01:06:54,425 --> 01:06:57,857
Ah, this thing was junk
the whole time.

1251
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,034
Not at all.

1252
01:07:01,136 --> 01:07:03,838
It was a highly accurate
tracking device

1253
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:06,531
that has led me
right to you and Tina.

1254
01:07:06,634 --> 01:07:07,699
Now, I was beginning to think

1255
01:07:07,801 --> 01:07:09,377
that she would
elude me forever.

1256
01:07:09,479 --> 01:07:10,609
She's smart.

1257
01:07:10,711 --> 01:07:12,674
She is mine.

1258
01:07:16,609 --> 01:07:17,710
And the Crimson Lance

1259
01:07:17,812 --> 01:07:18,953
are on their way
to collect her now.

1260
01:07:19,056 --> 01:07:20,718
If you come after her,
I'll destroy the key.

1261
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:21,787
No, you won't.

1262
01:07:21,889 --> 01:07:23,520
Because if you did,

1263
01:07:25,553 --> 01:07:26,852
then I would have to kill

1264
01:07:26,954 --> 01:07:29,688
the rest of that heroic band
of vault hunters

1265
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:31,765
she's been
slumming around with.

1266
01:07:31,867 --> 01:07:33,899
And I promise you, Lilith,

1267
01:07:34,001 --> 01:07:35,433
they won't be quick deaths.

1268
01:07:37,836 --> 01:07:39,173
Good.

1269
01:07:39,874 --> 01:07:41,238
Glad to see you making

1270
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:43,540
the smart choice for once.

1271
01:07:44,912 --> 01:07:46,573
And when this is over,

1272
01:07:46,675 --> 01:07:48,248
you'll be paid
what we agreed on.

1273
01:07:50,818 --> 01:07:51,713
Thank you, Lilith.

1274
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:03,624
Oh.

1275
01:08:03,727 --> 01:08:06,494
Tina, look, I know
how this must look, but...

1276
01:08:06,596 --> 01:08:09,203
I'm the only one
who can open the vault.

1277
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:14,901
And I'm gonna use whatever
is inside to kill him.

1278
01:08:19,741 --> 01:08:21,408
Too bad you won't
be around to see it.

1279
01:08:21,510 --> 01:08:23,115
- Wait.
- Enjoy your freedom.

1280
01:08:23,217 --> 01:08:24,482
Tina. Tina, no!

1281
01:09:06,796 --> 01:09:07,525
I'm dancing because...

1282
01:09:08,730 --> 01:09:10,162
you're alive.

1283
01:09:10,264 --> 01:09:11,664
Not because
I thought you were dead.

1284
01:09:11,766 --> 01:09:13,030
Heartwarming.

1285
01:09:13,132 --> 01:09:14,464
Where are the others?

1286
01:09:14,566 --> 01:09:15,899
They found a truck
in the village and left.

1287
01:09:16,001 --> 01:09:16,996
Without me.

1288
01:09:18,135 --> 01:09:19,273
What village?

1289
01:09:22,674 --> 01:09:23,975
This must have
been one of the original

1290
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:25,345
Pandoran settlements.

1291
01:09:25,978 --> 01:09:27,215
How quaint.

1292
01:09:29,851 --> 01:09:31,043
I know this place.

1293
01:09:48,469 --> 01:09:50,000
Come on.
Come on. Leave it.

1294
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:51,371
Come on, sweetie.

1295
01:09:52,975 --> 01:09:54,774
Hurry, give me Lilith!

1296
01:09:54,876 --> 01:09:56,134
Come on! Come on!

1297
01:09:57,672 --> 01:09:59,372
Remember I will always love you!

1298
01:09:59,474 --> 01:10:00,215
Mama!

1299
01:10:00,945 --> 01:10:02,547
No!

1300
01:10:10,885 --> 01:10:11,853
Hey,
where are you going?

1301
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:13,921
Lilith.

1302
01:10:14,729 --> 01:10:15,494
Lilith!

1303
01:10:32,507 --> 01:10:34,108
Is this your home?

1304
01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:35,206
Yeah.

1305
01:10:36,182 --> 01:10:38,286
I used to live here once.

1306
01:10:54,002 --> 01:10:55,534
This place is...

1307
01:10:57,031 --> 01:10:59,868
reminiscent of something
deep in my files.

1308
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:04,708
That drawing...

1309
01:11:06,609 --> 01:11:08,283
I feel strange.

1310
01:11:14,789 --> 01:11:15,785
Lilith.

1311
01:11:16,691 --> 01:11:17,490
Mom?

1312
01:11:18,928 --> 01:11:20,152
If you're seeing this...

1313
01:11:22,691 --> 01:11:23,925
I'm afraid I didn't make it.

1314
01:11:26,026 --> 01:11:28,868
I'm so sorry
that I sent you away.

1315
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:30,437
I didn't want to.

1316
01:11:31,898 --> 01:11:33,873
But as soon as I realized

1317
01:11:33,975 --> 01:11:35,634
what you are,

1318
01:11:35,736 --> 01:11:37,004
what you might become...

1319
01:11:38,645 --> 01:11:41,415
I knew you'd never
be safe here on Pandora.

1320
01:11:42,644 --> 01:11:44,779
But if you ever return,

1321
01:11:44,882 --> 01:11:47,751
I've made sure
that Claptrap will find you,

1322
01:11:48,782 --> 01:11:50,787
help you understand...

1323
01:11:51,993 --> 01:11:52,987
your destiny.

1324
01:11:57,967 --> 01:12:00,027
Lilith, I love you.

1325
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:11,203
I wish...

1326
01:12:12,675 --> 01:12:16,175
I could hold you one last time.

1327
01:12:27,697 --> 01:12:28,462
Tina!

1328
01:12:31,531 --> 01:12:34,163
Whoa.
That was weird.

1329
01:12:34,265 --> 01:12:36,267
I blacked out.

1330
01:12:36,369 --> 01:12:39,171
Did something important happen?

1331
01:13:04,826 --> 01:13:06,267
It's saying it's here.

1332
01:13:06,369 --> 01:13:07,759
All I'm seeing
is some holes.

1333
01:13:07,861 --> 01:13:09,434
Are you sure this is it?

1334
01:13:09,536 --> 01:13:10,765
I don't know.
It's somewhere.

1335
01:13:10,867 --> 01:13:12,203
Okay,
what does it look like?

1336
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:14,167
Big. It's an arch.

1337
01:13:15,971 --> 01:13:17,937
It's here somewhere.
I know it's here.

1338
01:13:18,039 --> 01:13:19,037
How do you know it's here?

1339
01:13:19,139 --> 01:13:21,138
Because I'm feeling emotion.

1340
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:22,580
Can you be more specific?

1341
01:13:22,683 --> 01:13:24,648
- Thing of power!
- Not right now, Krieg. Please.

1342
01:13:24,751 --> 01:13:26,754
- Okay, I get it...
- But that means something!

1343
01:13:26,856 --> 01:13:27,987
No, no, no!

1344
01:13:28,089 --> 01:13:29,457
I'm not following.

1345
01:13:44,272 --> 01:13:46,606
Krieg, you genius. You found it!

1346
01:14:04,757 --> 01:14:06,318
I have to warn you,
this might kill you.

1347
01:14:07,787 --> 01:14:09,195
Me?

1348
01:14:09,297 --> 01:14:12,191
Nah, kid. I'm the special one.

1349
01:14:12,293 --> 01:14:14,601
Whatever this is,
it's gonna make me invincible.

1350
01:14:46,926 --> 01:14:48,699
What just happened?

1351
01:14:48,801 --> 01:14:51,198
I'm the special one.
It should do something.

1352
01:14:55,307 --> 01:14:56,610
Apparently not.

1353
01:14:59,181 --> 01:15:00,680
Well done, Tina.

1354
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:02,308
Well done.

1355
01:15:06,956 --> 01:15:07,852
Amazing effort.

1356
01:15:26,774 --> 01:15:28,673
You survived the worst planet
in the galaxy.

1357
01:15:28,775 --> 01:15:31,938
You found the key
and the vault itself.

1358
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:33,911
You've made your father
so proud.

1359
01:15:37,316 --> 01:15:38,476
Commander Knoxx,

1360
01:15:39,883 --> 01:15:41,352
I need
her nervous system intact.

1361
01:15:41,454 --> 01:15:43,052
Keep the organs on ice.

1362
01:15:44,991 --> 01:15:47,056
Perhaps we'll have better luck
with the next clone.

1363
01:15:48,329 --> 01:15:49,663
Hey, asshole.

1364
01:15:58,331 --> 01:16:00,941
That was quite
an entrance, Roland.

1365
01:16:01,043 --> 01:16:02,301
You miss me?

1366
01:16:02,403 --> 01:16:04,436
You might have saved the day
if it wasn't for...

1367
01:16:05,973 --> 01:16:07,406
my Atlas auto shield.

1368
01:16:13,385 --> 01:16:14,814
Kill them all.

1369
01:16:20,524 --> 01:16:21,629
Hold your fire.

1370
01:16:22,229 --> 01:16:23,429
That's an order.

1371
01:16:23,531 --> 01:16:24,757
You heard the commander.

1372
01:16:24,859 --> 01:16:25,765
Weapons down.

1373
01:16:32,066 --> 01:16:32,970
Roland, you were right.

1374
01:16:35,242 --> 01:16:36,241
I should've...

1375
01:16:40,113 --> 01:16:41,342
No!

1376
01:16:41,444 --> 01:16:42,441
No!

1377
01:16:44,077 --> 01:16:45,378
Any other objections?

1378
01:16:46,287 --> 01:16:47,578
Just one!

1379
01:16:49,952 --> 01:16:52,125
That you continue breathing.

1380
01:16:52,227 --> 01:16:53,592
But I'll allow it

1381
01:16:53,694 --> 01:16:55,663
if you let my friends
go in peace.

1382
01:16:57,122 --> 01:16:58,495
And tell me, Lilith,

1383
01:16:58,597 --> 01:17:00,327
just why would I do that?

1384
01:17:03,571 --> 01:17:05,167
Because I'm the daughter
of Eridia.

1385
01:17:07,070 --> 01:17:08,801
I've seen that
before somewhere.

1386
01:17:08,903 --> 01:17:09,934
Firehawk.

1387
01:17:10,036 --> 01:17:11,310
Eridian goddess.

1388
01:17:11,412 --> 01:17:12,746
It's your planet, Lilith.

1389
01:17:13,612 --> 01:17:14,808
You have to protect it.

1390
01:17:14,910 --> 01:17:16,682
Mama loved you.

1391
01:17:16,784 --> 01:17:19,043
She always told me
how special you were.

1392
01:17:19,145 --> 01:17:21,281
I found it.

1393
01:17:21,383 --> 01:17:22,386
How did...?
I don't know.

1394
01:17:22,488 --> 01:17:24,285
Just lucky, I guess.

1395
01:17:28,993 --> 01:17:30,495
Daughter of Eridia, baby!

1396
01:17:30,597 --> 01:17:32,198
Bet you didn't see that coming!

1397
01:17:34,971 --> 01:17:35,961
But...

1398
01:17:36,063 --> 01:17:36,968
But I'm the special one.

1399
01:17:38,305 --> 01:17:39,333
Oh, you are.

1400
01:17:40,508 --> 01:17:41,676
Just not the way you thought.

1401
01:17:43,311 --> 01:17:44,305
I open the vault...

1402
01:17:45,478 --> 01:17:46,307
the girl goes free.

1403
01:17:49,009 --> 01:17:50,843
You open the vault

1404
01:17:50,945 --> 01:17:52,379
and you all go free.

1405
01:17:53,354 --> 01:17:54,513
You have my word.

1406
01:17:56,623 --> 01:17:58,555
I just figured it out.

1407
01:17:58,657 --> 01:18:01,394
Your mother gave you to me

1408
01:18:01,496 --> 01:18:02,926
to take you away from here,

1409
01:18:03,028 --> 01:18:05,524
so you would never
have to open that vault.

1410
01:18:05,626 --> 01:18:06,866
Well, that worked out great.

1411
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,001
I have to open it.

1412
01:18:13,299 --> 01:18:15,107
No salvation without sacrifice.

1413
01:18:15,210 --> 01:18:16,238
Remember?

1414
01:18:17,608 --> 01:18:18,636
But you can't.

1415
01:18:19,181 --> 01:18:20,178
You can't.

1416
01:18:20,281 --> 01:18:21,639
It's fine.

1417
01:18:22,217 --> 01:18:23,311
You're safe.

1418
01:18:24,483 --> 01:18:25,478
And, Tina,

1419
01:18:26,487 --> 01:18:28,346
memories are more powerful

1420
01:18:28,448 --> 01:18:31,291
than anything
Atlas could ever create.

1421
01:18:31,393 --> 01:18:33,920
Now, you got one of me.

1422
01:19:49,269 --> 01:19:50,596
Yes.

1423
01:20:03,782 --> 01:20:05,375
Tannis, what's happening?

1424
01:20:05,477 --> 01:20:07,220
The Eridians have delivered us

1425
01:20:07,322 --> 01:20:08,982
a champion.

1426
01:20:25,474 --> 01:20:27,131
The legends were true.

1427
01:20:27,233 --> 01:20:28,408
She's the Firehawk.

1428
01:20:28,510 --> 01:20:30,009
Lilith, can you hear me?

1429
01:20:31,777 --> 01:20:34,706
Take me into the vault.

1430
01:20:34,808 --> 01:20:36,950
If you won't, I'm going
to have to hurt your friends.

1431
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:42,587
Pull me up!

1432
01:20:42,689 --> 01:20:43,682
Lilith, help!

1433
01:21:04,207 --> 01:21:06,177
Make it rain, Tina!

1434
01:21:14,289 --> 01:21:15,354
Attack!

1435
01:21:20,694 --> 01:21:21,925
Are you guys shooting?

1436
01:21:22,027 --> 01:21:23,389
I'm sorry,
I didn't feel a thing.

1437
01:21:23,491 --> 01:21:24,263
You get a bullet.
You get a bullet.

1438
01:21:24,366 --> 01:21:25,592
Run, run.

1439
01:21:32,701 --> 01:21:34,601
Interplanetary
ninja assassin mode activated.

1440
01:21:36,469 --> 01:21:38,772
Step aside, bitches.

1441
01:22:31,631 --> 01:22:33,891
Lilith. Lilith!

1442
01:22:35,732 --> 01:22:36,971
No!

1443
01:22:37,771 --> 01:22:39,567
Lilith, can you hear me?

1444
01:22:47,948 --> 01:22:49,280
Well, it was fun
while it lasted.

1445
01:22:54,316 --> 01:22:56,782
Lilith. Come on, Lilith.

1446
01:23:04,432 --> 01:23:05,197
Lilith.

1447
01:23:06,391 --> 01:23:07,331
Please wake up.

1448
01:23:08,834 --> 01:23:10,532
Tannis, run.

1449
01:23:53,012 --> 01:23:55,643
Nobody kills me but me!

1450
01:24:10,523 --> 01:24:12,264
Everybody, run!

1451
01:24:20,742 --> 01:24:21,735
Go! Move, move!

1452
01:24:29,683 --> 01:24:30,447
Shit!

1453
01:24:52,104 --> 01:24:53,470
Tannis, you're alive.

1454
01:24:54,004 --> 01:24:55,774
I'm alive!

1455
01:24:55,876 --> 01:24:57,408
This guy, not so much.

1456
01:25:05,949 --> 01:25:06,948
A siren.

1457
01:25:07,050 --> 01:25:08,045
Tina!

1458
01:25:08,556 --> 01:25:09,552
Tina!

1459
01:25:10,558 --> 01:25:11,554
Tina!

1460
01:25:15,731 --> 01:25:17,230
Tannis, where's Tina?

1461
01:25:17,797 --> 01:25:18,792
Lilith!

1462
01:25:20,970 --> 01:25:22,999
I warned you
not to disappoint me.

1463
01:25:23,101 --> 01:25:25,604
Take me to the vault now.

1464
01:25:46,795 --> 01:25:48,921
Well, shit.

1465
01:26:00,004 --> 01:26:01,831
Let go of me!

1466
01:26:01,933 --> 01:26:03,177
Keep struggling
and I'll kill you.

1467
01:26:08,979 --> 01:26:10,841
Lilith!

1468
01:26:10,943 --> 01:26:12,010
Lilith, show yourself!

1469
01:26:13,779 --> 01:26:15,288
Show yourself or I kill her!

1470
01:26:16,625 --> 01:26:17,620
I'll do it!

1471
01:26:18,517 --> 01:26:19,653
Believe me.

1472
01:26:19,755 --> 01:26:20,953
Oh, I believe you.

1473
01:26:22,489 --> 01:26:23,725
Ah, Lilith.

1474
01:26:25,491 --> 01:26:26,233
This is...

1475
01:26:30,001 --> 01:26:31,370
unbelievable.

1476
01:26:34,538 --> 01:26:36,837
So much more
than I ever imagined.

1477
01:26:40,008 --> 01:26:43,582
The treasures of a race
who once ruled the galaxies.

1478
01:26:43,684 --> 01:26:44,680
Look.

1479
01:26:47,153 --> 01:26:49,256
The power. Can you feel it?

1480
01:26:50,054 --> 01:26:51,489
Can you...

1481
01:26:53,896 --> 01:26:55,592
Yeah, I can feel it.

1482
01:26:56,890 --> 01:26:59,766
Honestly, it makes me
a little sick.

1483
01:26:59,868 --> 01:27:01,592
You'll get used to it.

1484
01:27:01,694 --> 01:27:03,193
Yeah. You see...

1485
01:27:03,295 --> 01:27:06,163
I have something that a man
like you will never have.

1486
01:27:08,973 --> 01:27:09,936
Enough.

1487
01:27:13,246 --> 01:27:14,413
Lilith.
Over here.

1488
01:27:16,751 --> 01:27:17,650
Lose something?

1489
01:27:19,555 --> 01:27:20,551
Tina!

1490
01:27:27,026 --> 01:27:27,789
Ta-da.

1491
01:27:31,931 --> 01:27:32,995
Bye-bye.

1492
01:27:33,097 --> 01:27:34,826
No, Lilith.

1493
01:27:34,928 --> 01:27:35,929
- Lilith, please.
-Don't worry.

1494
01:27:37,269 --> 01:27:38,899
You won't get lonely down here.

1495
01:27:40,741 --> 01:27:41,971
No. No.

1496
01:27:42,073 --> 01:27:43,808
No, no, no. No!

1497
01:27:43,910 --> 01:27:45,378
Lilith! Tina!

1498
01:27:46,044 --> 01:27:48,577
No, no, no!

Coming through.

Make way for the hero!

1503
01:28:32,121 --> 01:28:33,550
Hey.

1504
01:28:33,652 --> 01:28:34,427
You hear that?

1505
01:28:35,290 --> 01:28:36,657
What?

1506
01:28:36,759 --> 01:28:40,257
That I think is what
peace sounds like.

1507
01:28:43,003 --> 01:28:44,030
Enjoy it.

1508
01:28:45,071 --> 01:28:46,169
Let's make it last.

1509
01:28:46,271 --> 01:28:47,867
I made you a little tea.

1510
01:28:47,969 --> 01:28:49,838
I thought you might be
a little dehydrated.

1511
01:29:21,208 --> 01:29:22,942
All right, guys. Let's, um...

1512
01:29:23,044 --> 01:29:24,208
Let's join the party.

1513
01:29:24,310 --> 01:29:27,079
All right! Hooray!

1514
01:29:27,181 --> 01:29:30,173
Whoops. Premature celebration.

1515
01:29:30,276 --> 01:29:31,541
That's never happened before.

1516
01:29:31,644 --> 01:29:32,683
You ready?

1517
01:29:34,055 --> 01:29:35,116
We'll meet you there.

1518
01:29:35,219 --> 01:29:36,888
I got you.

1519
01:29:36,990 --> 01:29:37,957
Come on, Krieg.

1520
01:29:38,059 --> 01:29:39,058
Time to go get drunk.

1521
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:41,087
Glorious meat fiesta.

1522
01:29:44,865 --> 01:29:45,597
So...

1523
01:29:47,164 --> 01:29:48,160
Uh...

1524
01:29:49,135 --> 01:29:50,569
I don't think so.

1525
01:29:51,334 --> 01:29:52,937
Come on.

1526
01:29:53,039 --> 01:29:53,869
Do the thing.

1527
01:29:56,374 --> 01:29:58,103
I'm a bit old, I think,

1528
01:29:58,205 --> 01:30:00,947
to be setting myself on fire
for your amusement.

1529
01:30:01,049 --> 01:30:02,207
You know you want to.

1530
01:30:05,716 --> 01:30:06,712
Let me
tell you everything

1531
01:30:06,814 --> 01:30:09,082
you need to know about Pandora.

1532
01:30:10,057 --> 01:30:10,790
She's dangerous.

1533
01:30:10,892 --> 01:30:12,281
She's dirty.

1534
01:30:12,384 --> 01:30:14,758
And she's definitely
a toxic waste dump.

1535
01:30:16,229 --> 01:30:17,926
But, she's my home.

1536
01:30:23,929 --> 01:30:25,505

I come to dance, mofo.

1556
01:32:36,128 --> 01:32:37,731
Twerk it. Work it out, now.

01:32:37,833 --> 01:32:38,897
Do the Claptrap. It's my...

Oh, hey! Hey, wait! No, no, no!

1559
01:32:40,505 --> 01:32:42,074
What's goin' on here? No!

1560
01:32:42,176 --> 01:32:43,108
It's my Easter egg!

Ah! You son of a...

Not when I'm giving the people
what they want!
