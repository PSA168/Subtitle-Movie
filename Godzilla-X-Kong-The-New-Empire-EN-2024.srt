<i>For most
of human civilization,</i>

10
00:05:01,562 --> 00:05:05,479
<i>we believed that we were
Earth's most dominant species.</i>

11
00:05:05,653 --> 00:05:07,394
<i>We believed that life...</i>

12
00:05:07,568 --> 00:05:10,962
<i>...could only exist
on the surface of the planet.</i>

13
00:05:11,136 --> 00:05:13,182
<i>Well, after a certain point,
you have to wonder</i>

14
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:17,273
what else were we wrong about?

15
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,626
We have mapped

16
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,413
less than five percent
of Hollow Earth.

17
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:29,241
<i>But our ecosystems
are linked in ways</i>

18
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,896
<i>we never could have imagined.</i>

19
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,072
We are not
two separate worlds.

20
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:35,247
We're one.

21
00:05:38,947 --> 00:05:41,341
<i>Kong is settling in
to Hollow Earth.</i>

22
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:43,386
<i>So, the big guy likes
his new home.</i>

23
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,996
<i>We think so.</i>

24
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,782
<i>His species
was a very social one.</i>

25
00:05:47,956 --> 00:05:50,393
<i>It's not natural
for Kong to be so alone.</i>

26
00:05:53,614 --> 00:05:55,355
<i>He's the last of his kind.</i>

27
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:56,791
<i>Every day he searches</i>

28
00:05:56,965 --> 00:05:58,749
<i>for a family
that he'll never find.</i>

29
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:02,623
<i>What about Godzilla?</i>

30
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:05,843
<i>Godzilla's
on the surface, Kong is below.</i>

31
00:06:06,017 --> 00:06:07,802
As long as they don't venture
into each other's territories,

32
00:06:07,976 --> 00:06:09,934
we've got nothing
to worry about.

33
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:11,806
<i>Humanity is lucky...</i>

34
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,981
<i>Godzilla's fighting
the battles we can't.</i>

35
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:32,234
<i>With some critics</i>

36
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:33,844
<i>calling out Monarch</i>

37
00:07:34,018 --> 00:07:35,933
<i>for the billions
in taxpayer dollars...</i>

38
00:07:36,107 --> 00:07:38,936
<i>going to Hollow Earth
and classified technologies</i>

39
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,199
<i>like the mysterious
Project Powerhouse.</i>

40
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:42,853
<i>Well, here to discuss,</i>

41
00:07:43,027 --> 00:07:45,421
<i>Monarch's own,
Doctor Ilene Andrews.</i>

42
00:07:45,595 --> 00:07:48,380
<i>Let's start with Godzilla.
He stopped the attack in Rome,</i>

43
00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:50,861
<i>but he's still in the city.
Should we be worried?</i>

44
00:07:51,035 --> 00:07:52,559
<i>It's clear to us now</i>

45
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:54,735
<i>that Godzilla is a Titan
who protects us</i>

46
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:56,606
<i>from other malicious
Titan threats.</i>

47
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,695
Kong's heading in
for the night.

48
00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:00,567
Looks like
it was another rough one.

49
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:02,394
That's the farthest
he's gone yet.

50
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:04,266
Maybe he was looking
for a date.

51
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,963
Good luck with that.

52
00:08:06,137 --> 00:08:08,531
I hope he's up
for some interspecies romance.

53
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:10,707
whoa.

54
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:12,056
<i>Sinkhole detected</i>

55
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,406
<i>in Sector Five.</i>

56
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:15,886
That's Kong's
hunting ground.

57
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:30,379
Whoa. It keeps doing that.

58
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,731
More electrical anomalies?

59
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:36,211
Nah,
I don't think so, man.

60
00:08:36,385 --> 00:08:37,908
I haven't seen anything
like this before.

61
00:08:38,082 --> 00:08:39,431
Well, we should
tell Director Hampton.

62
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:41,521
I'll type it up.

63
00:08:41,695 --> 00:08:43,479
This whole place
is an anomaly.

64
00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:47,222
It's so weird.

65
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:03,934
Tell the Italian military
Rome would be flattened

66
00:09:04,108 --> 00:09:05,457
if it weren't for Godzilla.

67
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:07,111
They can threaten him
all they want.

68
00:09:07,285 --> 00:09:09,374
Just tell them
to find another scapegoat.

69
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,115
Director Hampton, what's up?

70
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:13,422
Well, [sighs] Outpost One
is still a nightmare,

71
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:14,989
and they sent this over.

72
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:16,773
I thought you might want
to take a look.

73
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:18,514
Is this from the sensor array?

74
00:09:18,688 --> 00:09:20,951
Yeah, we've been getting
some pretty weird spikes.

75
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,518
I mean, it could just
be regular interference.

76
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:24,346
- Yeah, but it keeps happening.
- Mm-hmm.

77
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,782
We should prep a survey team
just in case.

78
00:09:25,956 --> 00:09:27,349
Okay.

79
00:09:27,523 --> 00:09:29,003
And what about Godzilla?

80
00:09:29,177 --> 00:09:33,790
Oh, he's still sleeping.
Like a big angry baby.

81
00:09:33,964 --> 00:09:36,663
Let's hope
it stays that way.

82
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,329
<i>Everyone,</i>

83
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:53,810
<i>eyes on your own paper,
all right?</i>

84
00:09:53,984 --> 00:09:55,812
Let's make sure
we circle the answers

85
00:09:55,986 --> 00:09:57,988
really, really clearly.

86
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,845
Jia!

87
00:10:43,077 --> 00:10:44,382
Your daughter is intelligent,

88
00:10:44,556 --> 00:10:46,297
but she's not engaged.

89
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:47,951
Her grades are slipping,

90
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,388
she's not interacting
with any of her friends.

91
00:10:50,562 --> 00:10:53,043
And these problems aren't
going away, Doctor Andrews.

92
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:55,524
They've been getting worse.

93
00:10:57,047 --> 00:10:58,440
Okay, I'm sorry.

94
00:10:58,614 --> 00:11:00,442
She's just still adjusting
to our world.

95
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:01,878
I understand that,

96
00:11:02,052 --> 00:11:03,184
but we have
a number of students

97
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:04,576
who are
culturally displaced and--

98
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:05,447
Sure, but her culture's
not displaced,

99
00:11:05,621 --> 00:11:07,101
she is her culture.

100
00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:10,060
She's the last living member
of the Iwi tribe.

101
00:11:10,234 --> 00:11:11,409
We're just trying
to reach her.

102
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:16,719
I know. Join the club.

103
00:12:04,245 --> 00:12:05,246
Come on.

104
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:13,820
<i>For centuries,</i>

105
00:12:13,994 --> 00:12:16,126
<i>the Iwi tribe were
the guardians of Skull Island,</i>

106
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,738
<i>the ancestral home
of the great Kong.</i>

107
00:12:18,912 --> 00:12:20,827
<i>But when
shifting storm patterns</i>

108
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:23,133
<i>destroyed the island,
the Iwi were annihilated...</i>

109
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:24,569
<i>...with only a single member</i>

110
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,920
<i>of the tribe having survived.</i>

111
00:12:27,094 --> 00:12:28,835
<i>A young girl...</i>

112
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:31,533
<i>...found and rescued
amid the punishing storm.</i>

113
00:12:31,707 --> 00:12:33,927
<i>Her fellow villagers
were lost to the tides.</i>

114
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:36,973
<i>Gone to history, just like
the great Kongs themselves.</i>

115
00:12:37,147 --> 00:12:38,714
Holy shit.

116
00:12:38,888 --> 00:12:40,498
<i>The Iwi were unique...</i>

117
00:12:40,672 --> 00:12:42,762
<i>...in the sense that they
had no spoken language.</i>

118
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:44,589
<i>Many believe
that tribe members developed</i>

119
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,895
<i>the ability to communicate...</i>

120
00:13:44,214 --> 00:13:45,825
We're gonna figure this out.

121
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:57,793
Where will you be

122
00:13:57,967 --> 00:13:59,926
when the next Titan attacks?

123
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,625
How will you protect
the things and people

124
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:04,931
that matter most to you?

125
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:08,760
Today's podcast
is brought to you

126
00:14:08,935 --> 00:14:10,458
by Gargantua insurance,
the only insurance company

127
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:12,416
that provides Titan protection
for your home

128
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,375
and personal belongings.

129
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:15,985
'Cause Godzilla may not care
about your hopes and dreams,

130
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:18,118
but Gargantua does.

131
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:20,250
Okay, Titan truthers!

132
00:14:20,424 --> 00:14:21,904
Oh, we have got a lot...

133
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:23,950
...to unpack on today's show.

134
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:25,386
Recording in progress,

135
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,561
go away!

136
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:29,825
Uh, yes. I just want
to let everyone know

137
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:31,435
that there is no...

138
00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:33,089
I'm gonna kill...

139
00:14:33,263 --> 00:14:34,961
Unbelievable! What?

140
00:14:35,613 --> 00:14:36,745
Uh...

141
00:14:38,268 --> 00:14:40,967
Hi, Bernie.

142
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:42,751
Ilene Andrews,
we met in Hong Kong.

143
00:14:43,578 --> 00:14:44,535
Oh. Oh.

144
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:46,146
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

145
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,669
Hong Kong.
Yeah, that was so long ago.

146
00:14:47,843 --> 00:14:50,715
So, no, God, uh, yeah.

147
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,847
That was when
my hair was longer.

148
00:14:52,021 --> 00:14:52,935
You cut your hair.

149
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:54,415
Highlights too, it's nice.

150
00:14:57,244 --> 00:14:58,898
I was wondering if I could get
your help with something.

151
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:01,422
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

152
00:15:02,771 --> 00:15:04,642
Uh, sure.

153
00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:07,558
Sure, yeah. Of course, yeah.
Come on in, Doctor Andrews.

154
00:15:07,732 --> 00:15:09,473
- Okay.
- Yeah.

155
00:15:09,647 --> 00:15:10,648
Just straight down
that hall there.

156
00:15:10,822 --> 00:15:11,911
To the left. Okay.

157
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:16,306
Have a seat.
What can I help you with?

158
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,309
You know, <i>mi casa es su</i> home.

159
00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:21,572
Okay, so.
The sequence on the right,

160
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:23,923
this is a signal
that's been interfering

161
00:15:24,097 --> 00:15:24,836
with our equipment
in Hollow Earth.

162
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:26,926
- Okay.
- And, uh...

163
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,494
And these are drawings
by my daughter, Jia.

164
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:34,368
And you're gonna think
that I'm completely insane.

165
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:37,066
No, the patterns are the same
in the middle section.

166
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,895
Yes. Exactly.

167
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:41,810
Thank you.

168
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:43,333
Look, our analysts,

169
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:44,813
they don't know
what to make of this.

170
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:46,162
They're talking in circles,

171
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:47,598
they're saying
"radio interference,"

172
00:15:47,772 --> 00:15:49,252
"coincidence," but I...

173
00:15:49,426 --> 00:15:51,341
I know that you think
outside of the box.

174
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:53,517
I didn't know
who else to turn to.

175
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:55,128
And they sent you
here because...?

176
00:15:55,302 --> 00:15:56,433
No, no one sent me.
I came here on my...

177
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:57,739
You know,
that's what's ironic.

178
00:15:57,913 --> 00:15:59,306
You know,
Monarch wouldn't confirm

179
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,047
my crucial part
in taking down Mechagodzilla,

180
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:03,092
which cost me thousands of...

181
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:05,268
hundreds of subscribers
on my blog.

182
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:07,270
Oh, and the trolls...

183
00:16:07,444 --> 00:16:08,619
the trolls online,
they question

184
00:16:08,793 --> 00:16:10,056
every single thing
that I put up.

185
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,362
Especially this one troll.

186
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:13,842
This one troll named
ghidorastan64.

187
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:15,278
You ever heard of him?

188
00:16:15,452 --> 00:16:16,627
- No, I don't think I have.
- Great,

189
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:18,238
because he's a trash bag, okay?

190
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:19,587
I'm more qualified
than half of those people

191
00:16:19,761 --> 00:16:20,980
that you have working
over there.

192
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:22,546
I knew what Godzilla
was going to do

193
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,157
before anybody
at Monarch said...

194
00:16:24,331 --> 00:16:26,507
Which is why I am here,
Bernie.

195
00:16:26,681 --> 00:16:28,509
I am here. Okay?

196
00:16:31,468 --> 00:16:32,948
Can you help me or not?

197
00:16:33,862 --> 00:16:35,255
That depends.

198
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:36,952
Are you the new boss
down at the Mess?

199
00:16:37,126 --> 00:16:38,388
The what?

200
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:39,868
The Monarch
Hollow Earth Station.

201
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:41,739
The MHES, the Mess.

202
00:16:41,913 --> 00:16:43,132
Yeah, nobody calls it that.

203
00:16:43,306 --> 00:16:45,178
I run the Kong
research division

204
00:16:45,352 --> 00:16:47,789
but technically
Director Hampton is in charge

205
00:16:47,963 --> 00:16:49,791
- of general operations.
- Hmm.

206
00:16:49,965 --> 00:16:51,314
Well, Director Hampton
doesn't have a kid

207
00:16:51,488 --> 00:16:52,707
who can talk to Kong.

208
00:16:57,146 --> 00:16:58,800
You want to go
to Hollow Earth.

209
00:16:58,974 --> 00:17:00,280
I'm so glad
I didn't have to say it.

210
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:01,977
I thought you were never
gonna ask

211
00:17:02,151 --> 00:17:03,587
- but I really do need proof.
- No, I'm not asking.

212
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:05,285
I mean, that would help me
with my bona fides

213
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:06,808
for my blog. And I knew
that you would be the person

214
00:17:06,982 --> 00:17:08,549
to help me do that.

215
00:17:08,723 --> 00:17:09,811
Okay. Well, if this happens,
and that is a big if,

216
00:17:09,985 --> 00:17:11,639
then Monarch would need,
you know,

217
00:17:11,813 --> 00:17:13,206
whatever you guys call it.
Final cut on anything in...

218
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,990
Whoa. I'm sorry,
final cut? No, no, no.

219
00:17:15,164 --> 00:17:16,600
You know, that will destroy
my journalistic integrity.

220
00:17:16,774 --> 00:17:18,776
Shit.

221
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:19,995
No really true, good
documentarian gives final cut.

222
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:21,518
I could make you a producer.

223
00:17:21,692 --> 00:17:23,042
Okay, okay! Fine! Final cut!
Final cut! Fine!

224
00:17:23,216 --> 00:17:24,347
Look, something is happening
to my daughter,

225
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:27,263
and I have no idea
how to fix it.

226
00:17:27,437 --> 00:17:29,048
You work out what's going on,

227
00:17:29,222 --> 00:17:30,005
and I will get you anything
that you want, okay?

228
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:31,441
That is a promise.

229
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:32,834
Well, anything is a lot,

230
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:34,444
but that's very generous,
but I...

231
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:36,968
- And we have to go. Right now.
- What?

232
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:38,753
Godzilla is on the move again.

233
00:18:35,244 --> 00:18:37,028
Okay, listen to me.

234
00:18:37,203 --> 00:18:38,508
If Godzilla's on the move,
he senses a threat coming.

235
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:40,206
We don't know what it is.

236
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,468
<i>And you're not concerned?</i>

237
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:42,947
Of course we're concerned,
Senator.

238
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,949
That's why we're monitoring
the situation.

239
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:45,820
<i>Monitor the fact
that if Godzilla heads...</i>

240
00:18:45,994 --> 00:18:47,430
What is it? You just...

241
00:18:47,604 --> 00:18:48,083
- And I am telling you,
- We have a problem!

242
00:18:48,257 --> 00:18:49,563
Senator...

243
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:51,217
that Kong doesn't
leave Hollow Earth.

244
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:54,829
Which is why Godzilla has
no reason to retaliate.

245
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:08,408
- What's he doing up here?
- No idea.

246
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:10,540
- Well, does Godzilla know?
- Not that we can tell.

247
00:19:10,714 --> 00:19:12,412
Yeah, well, it's only
a matter of time.

248
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:15,110
And what happens if Godzilla
starts heading this way?

249
00:19:15,284 --> 00:19:16,981
Then we all run like hell.

250
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,069
Get up, let's go!

251
00:19:18,244 --> 00:19:19,158
Keep it up. Come on. Let's go.

252
00:19:46,097 --> 00:19:47,229
Sedatives in place.

253
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:56,934
<i>All right, the good news is</i>

254
00:19:57,108 --> 00:19:58,719
<i>it's just an infected tooth.</i>

255
00:19:58,893 --> 00:20:02,418
But luckily, you've come
to the best doctor in town.

256
00:20:07,031 --> 00:20:08,119
<i>♪ I gotcha ♪</i>

257
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:16,476
<i>♪ I gotcha ♪</i>

258
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,260
<i>All right,
Kong sedation at a 100%.</i>

259
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:19,609
<i>Vitals stable.</i>

260
00:20:19,783 --> 00:20:21,307
<i>Trapper, you are clear to swap</i>

261
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:22,656
<i>the damaged tooth
with replacement.</i>

262
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:27,487
Way-hey!

263
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:31,230
Touchdown, Trapper.

264
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:45,461
Whoa. Fella.

265
00:20:45,635 --> 00:20:46,462
What'd you have for breakfast?

266
00:20:50,161 --> 00:20:51,162
All right?

267
00:20:53,817 --> 00:20:55,645
Yeah, this sucker's ready
to come out.

268
00:20:58,213 --> 00:20:59,345
Whoa.

269
00:21:00,563 --> 00:21:01,477
All right, let's roll!

270
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:24,718
There she is.

271
00:21:25,675 --> 00:21:27,373
Trapper.

272
00:21:27,547 --> 00:21:29,026
Thanks for getting down here
so fast. Nice work.

273
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,420
You are most welcome.

274
00:21:31,594 --> 00:21:32,856
It's not every day
you get to climb

275
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,728
inside a 300-foot ape's mouth,
is it?

276
00:21:34,902 --> 00:21:36,599
Yeah. And you're sure it's
gonna be strong enough?

277
00:21:36,773 --> 00:21:37,905
The tooth? Yeah.

278
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,472
That's the same
polymer composite

279
00:21:39,646 --> 00:21:40,908
they use on the vehicle
heat shields.

280
00:21:42,605 --> 00:21:43,563
He could chomp through

281
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:45,129
the Eiffel Tower
with that thing.

282
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,696
Well,
good teeth aren't gonna help

283
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,568
if Godzilla senses
that he's up here.

284
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:51,962
Well. You can't have a Titan
with a toothache,

285
00:21:52,136 --> 00:21:53,181
can you?

286
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:54,661
- No.
- Don't worry.

287
00:21:54,835 --> 00:21:56,053
Couple of hours
he might be a bit groggy,

288
00:21:56,227 --> 00:21:58,055
but he'll be good to go
back down.

289
00:21:58,229 --> 00:21:59,405
You know, when I first heard
that you were gonna be a vet

290
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:00,884
I thought no.

291
00:22:01,058 --> 00:22:02,451
That is way too boring

292
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,235
for Trapper.

293
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,802
Then you go and become the
weirdest vet in the world.

294
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:07,717
Yeah, it's basically
me and Doctor Dolittle.

295
00:22:07,891 --> 00:22:10,764
Except my animals are bigger.

296
00:22:10,938 --> 00:22:13,549
I thought finally, someone has
made him grow up.

297
00:22:13,723 --> 00:22:15,638
Nope. Someone tried that
back in college,

298
00:22:15,812 --> 00:22:18,337
- but... didn't really work.
- Oh, yeah?

299
00:22:18,511 --> 00:22:19,816
Yeah,
what was it she said to me?

300
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,166
"Trapper,
you are not a serious person."

301
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,254
Oh, she sounds very smart.

302
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:26,432
Yeah, ish. She got a PhD.

303
00:22:26,606 --> 00:22:28,434
Two, actually.

304
00:22:30,218 --> 00:22:32,089
How's the kid doing?

305
00:22:32,263 --> 00:22:35,092
You know. Struggling.

306
00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:37,268
Trying to find her place
in the world.

307
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:40,097
Yeah, I know how that goes.

308
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:42,230
Don't worry,
she'll be all right.

309
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:43,405
She got a good mum.

310
00:22:59,987 --> 00:23:04,383
Doctor Andrews. Your guest
has been asking for you.

311
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,603
Please don't take this
the wrong way,

312
00:23:07,777 --> 00:23:09,562
but can I just say,

313
00:23:09,736 --> 00:23:11,346
that your research library
has many glaring omissions.

314
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,782
I had to call in
some serious favors

315
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:14,305
from my Discord chat.
They were not...

316
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,829
Bernie, do you have something?

317
00:23:16,003 --> 00:23:17,178
Yes, I've got something.
I do have something.

318
00:23:17,352 --> 00:23:19,049
Whatever signal
you guys are picking up,

319
00:23:19,223 --> 00:23:21,225
okay, we have seen similar
patterns repeating over time.

320
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,880
And each spike corresponds
with a specific Titan event.

321
00:23:24,054 --> 00:23:25,273
Can you hold this, please?
Thank you so much.

322
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:27,406
Okay, check this out.

323
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,321
See this? King Ghidorah, huh?
First encounter with Godzilla.

324
00:23:30,496 --> 00:23:31,453
- Mm-hmm.
- Here, uh,

325
00:23:31,627 --> 00:23:33,324
discovery of Skull Island.

326
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:35,239
All right. So what you're
saying is that these signals

327
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,980
- aren't just random patterns.
- Yeah, it seems that way, yes.

328
00:23:37,154 --> 00:23:38,504
And Godzilla's
picking up on it?

329
00:23:38,678 --> 00:23:40,244
Oh, I can do you one better.
Now, look,

330
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,811
I've looked
at points of similarities

331
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:43,639
in each wave form
and I compared them

332
00:23:43,813 --> 00:23:44,553
- to that pattern, and...
- Bernie, what are you saying?

333
00:23:44,727 --> 00:23:46,163
It's a distress call!

334
00:23:46,337 --> 00:23:48,731
It's a distress call.
A psychic energy SOS.

335
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:51,038
Now, if your daughter is
seeing these symbols,

336
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:53,823
then something down
there is calling for help.

337
00:23:56,826 --> 00:23:58,524
<i>Regular soundwaves,</i>

338
00:23:58,698 --> 00:24:00,874
they can't propagate this far
without decay. This?

339
00:24:01,048 --> 00:24:02,876
This is something that
we have never encountered.

340
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,226
- And it's getting stronger.
- You got a working theory?

341
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,706
Yeah,
telepathic alien language.

342
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,534
It's some sort of
distress signal.

343
00:24:09,926 --> 00:24:11,319
Signal? From what?

344
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:12,407
Or from who.

345
00:24:12,581 --> 00:24:13,843
Well, whatever it is,

346
00:24:14,017 --> 00:24:15,541
this is why Godzilla's
on the move?

347
00:24:15,715 --> 00:24:17,456
We can't say for sure.
But it seems that way.

348
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,849
Well, we have
to figure this out fast.

349
00:24:20,023 --> 00:24:23,462
The wolves are already
at our door.

350
00:24:23,636 --> 00:24:24,854
The government has been
looking for an excuse

351
00:24:25,028 --> 00:24:26,856
to take over
Hollow Earth operations.

352
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,858
And the corporations
are licking their chops.

353
00:24:29,032 --> 00:24:30,686
Yeah,
because who wants to be rich

354
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,383
and get rid
of all the monsters?

355
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:34,255
I mean, that'd be terrible, right?

356
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:36,213
We'd better find the source
before D.C. gets wind of this.

357
00:24:37,345 --> 00:24:40,479
Okay.

358
00:24:40,653 --> 00:24:42,872
I'm giving you
full operational oversight.

359
00:24:43,046 --> 00:24:45,092
Take a small team.
Mikael, make it fast

360
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:46,746
and don't let anyone die.

361
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,922
We'll be in and out of there
before nightfall.

362
00:24:49,096 --> 00:24:50,837
You, uh, you feel like
going for a ride?

363
00:24:52,403 --> 00:24:53,361
Thought you'd never ask.

364
00:24:58,758 --> 00:25:00,194
<i>Attention, all hands.</i>

365
00:25:00,368 --> 00:25:01,717
<i>Prepare HEAV three
for Hollow Earth launch</i>

366
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:04,764
<i>in T minus five minutes.</i>

367
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:06,809
There's no response
from the Hollow Earth outpost.

368
00:25:06,983 --> 00:25:08,158
Their radios must be down.

369
00:25:08,332 --> 00:25:09,595
Well, then
that's our first stop.

370
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:10,509
Copy that.

371
00:25:34,794 --> 00:25:36,752
All right, wakey wakey,
everyone. Kong's up.

372
00:25:57,294 --> 00:26:01,211
Hey. Hey! Doctor Andrews. Hey.
Come on, we had a deal!

373
00:26:01,385 --> 00:26:02,604
Bernie, this isn't sightseeing.

374
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:03,779
It's a reconnaissance mission.

375
00:26:03,953 --> 00:26:06,347
So, I see how it is.

376
00:26:06,521 --> 00:26:08,131
When you need something,
it's all

377
00:26:08,305 --> 00:26:09,829
"you're so smart, Bernie,
you're so capable, Bernie,

378
00:26:10,003 --> 00:26:11,831
"I'll subscribe
to your Titan blog, Bernie,"

379
00:26:12,005 --> 00:26:14,790
and when I deliver it,
you toss me aside.

380
00:26:14,964 --> 00:26:17,010
Okay, look.
This could be dangerous.

381
00:26:17,184 --> 00:26:18,664
Come on.

382
00:26:18,838 --> 00:26:20,535
I'm no stranger to danger.

383
00:26:22,406 --> 00:26:25,061
I didn't mean to rhyme
that time.

384
00:26:25,235 --> 00:26:28,238
Look, you owe me. Okay?
I helped crack this thing.

385
00:26:28,412 --> 00:26:30,284
This could be like last time,
when we saved the world.

386
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:31,502
Remember? Hmm?

387
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:35,550
- Mikael?
- Yeah.

388
00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:38,161
Prep a seat for one more.

389
00:26:38,335 --> 00:26:39,989
Thank you, Doctor Andrews!
You will not regret it.

390
00:26:40,163 --> 00:26:40,947
You're kidding, right?

391
00:26:42,905 --> 00:26:43,950
I'm the plus one. Hello.

392
00:26:47,867 --> 00:26:49,129
<i>Systems online.</i>

393
00:26:49,303 --> 00:26:50,478
Whoa. Oh. Whoa.

394
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:52,436
We're online.

395
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,264
We are going to Hollow Earth.

396
00:26:54,438 --> 00:26:58,225
I am going to Hollow Earth.

397
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:00,880
Oh, my God. What am I doing?

398
00:27:01,054 --> 00:27:02,359
So, is there, like,
a in-flight briefing

399
00:27:02,533 --> 00:27:03,665
that I should know about?
You know...

400
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,275
- Yeah, there is.
- He's very...

401
00:27:05,449 --> 00:27:07,582
There's no parachutes,
no flotation devices,

402
00:27:07,756 --> 00:27:09,236
you touch any of this stuff,

403
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:11,020
you lose your hand,
and if you die,

404
00:27:11,194 --> 00:27:12,674
make sure
it's outside my vehicle.

405
00:27:15,024 --> 00:27:18,288
Good briefing. Great briefing.

406
00:27:18,462 --> 00:27:20,203
Don't take Mikael
too personally.

407
00:27:20,377 --> 00:27:21,640
Aggression is
his love language.

408
00:27:28,385 --> 00:27:30,736
All right, Mikael.
Let's punch it.

409
00:27:40,223 --> 00:27:41,224
<i>HEAV one,</i>

410
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:42,225
<i>you are clear for launch.</i>

411
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,531
Let's do this.

412
00:27:55,935 --> 00:27:57,763
Just try not
to swallow your tongue.

413
00:27:57,937 --> 00:27:59,765
What?
Try not to swallow my tongue?

414
00:27:59,939 --> 00:28:00,983
I don't exactly know
what that means.

415
00:28:04,465 --> 00:28:05,596
<i>Base to HEAV,</i>

416
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:07,294
<i>you're clear for entry.</i>

417
00:28:07,468 --> 00:28:08,643
<i>On your count,</i>

418
00:28:08,817 --> 00:28:10,079
<i>- Doctor Andrews.</i>
- Three.

419
00:28:10,253 --> 00:28:10,993
All right, let's go.
Two.

420
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:12,516
I'm not ready.

421
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,301
And one.
Oh, my God!

422
00:28:38,542 --> 00:28:44,331
I'm turning into water.

423
00:29:06,048 --> 00:29:07,702
<i>Flight systems active.</i>

424
00:29:07,876 --> 00:29:09,486
<i>Systems stabilized.</i>

425
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,749
All systems good,

426
00:29:10,923 --> 00:29:11,967
- Doc.
- How's everyone doing?

427
00:29:12,141 --> 00:29:13,055
You all right?

428
00:29:13,229 --> 00:29:14,448
- Never better.
- Yeah?

429
00:29:14,622 --> 00:29:15,971
Bernie, you good?

430
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:23,152
Nice one. [panting] Oh, wow.
Whew.

431
00:29:44,913 --> 00:29:46,697
Looks like
Kong is headed home.

432
00:29:46,872 --> 00:29:48,569
How far to the outpost?
Hundred klicks.

433
00:29:48,743 --> 00:29:49,875
They're still
not answering comms.

434
00:29:52,355 --> 00:29:53,182
<i>Proximity alert.</i>

435
00:29:55,054 --> 00:29:56,316
Predators,
nine o'clock.

436
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:58,057
Where? What?

437
00:29:58,231 --> 00:29:59,058
Those are vertacines, Mikael.

438
00:29:59,232 --> 00:30:00,407
They're called vertacines.

439
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:01,974
Um, are they a problem?

440
00:30:02,148 --> 00:30:03,584
No.
They're totally harmless.

441
00:30:03,758 --> 00:30:05,151
Unless you get 'em riled up,
and then they pack

442
00:30:05,325 --> 00:30:06,674
about a lightning bolt
worth of bioelectricity.

443
00:30:10,591 --> 00:30:12,375
Predators know
to stay well away.

444
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:15,248
Which makes them
the perfect chaperone

445
00:30:15,422 --> 00:30:18,599
if you happen to have
a cool biomimicry camouflage.

446
00:30:18,773 --> 00:30:19,905
Which we do.

447
00:30:35,007 --> 00:30:36,660
Talk to me.
It's not good.

448
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,837
Godzilla just made landfall
in France.

449
00:30:39,011 --> 00:30:40,229
Ground team
is five klicks out.

450
00:30:56,463 --> 00:30:58,857
We got picture.

451
00:30:59,031 --> 00:31:01,468
Oh, my God.
It's a nuclear facility.

452
00:31:26,536 --> 00:31:27,668
Atmospheric radiation levels

453
00:31:27,842 --> 00:31:28,974
are dropping.
He's absorbing it.

454
00:31:29,148 --> 00:31:30,410
Okay, he's charging
for something.

455
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,578
<i>Godzilla consumed</i>

456
00:32:08,752 --> 00:32:10,319
<i>a huge amount of radiation.</i>

00:32:10,493 --> 00:32:13,018
<i>He is clearly preparing

458
00:32:13,192 --> 00:32:14,019
<i>Out of range.</i>

459
00:32:14,193 --> 00:32:15,498
Damn it.

460
00:32:15,672 --> 00:32:17,718
We're coming up
on Outpost One.

461
00:32:26,814 --> 00:32:28,511
Oh, God.

462
00:32:28,685 --> 00:32:29,991
Oh, well, now. That doesn't
look good now, does it?

463
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:32,385
You seeing this, Doc?

464
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:34,865
Yeah. Yeah, I'm seeing it.

465
00:33:04,591 --> 00:33:06,897
Well, there's
no heat signatures.

466
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,769
So much for survivors.

467
00:33:08,943 --> 00:33:12,120
God, have some respect.
These people had families.

468
00:33:12,294 --> 00:33:13,600
What could have done this?

469
00:33:14,862 --> 00:33:16,559
I don't understand,

470
00:33:16,733 --> 00:33:18,257
we've had this outpost
for years without incident.

471
00:33:18,431 --> 00:33:20,955
So, why attack now?
What changed?

472
00:33:26,265 --> 00:33:29,268
Hey, Doc.
There's a camera here.

473
00:33:29,442 --> 00:33:32,010
You reckon you can pull
any footage off of that?

474
00:33:32,967 --> 00:33:34,012
Oh, shit.

475
00:33:40,105 --> 00:33:42,281
You think Kong did that?

476
00:33:42,455 --> 00:33:45,588
No, that's not Kong.
That's something else.

477
00:33:45,762 --> 00:33:48,287
Yeah.
Let's get off the ground

478
00:33:48,461 --> 00:33:50,245
before that something else
comes back.

479
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:51,899
Saddle up.
Let's hustle.

480
00:38:58,727 --> 00:38:59,946
Are you getting
anything off that thing?

481
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:00,860
Yeah, I'm just...

482
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:04,864
Oh, my God.

483
00:39:05,038 --> 00:39:06,039
What?

484
00:39:07,432 --> 00:39:09,738
Here. Take a look.

485
00:39:09,912 --> 00:39:12,393
It looks like an ape.
But that's impossible.

486
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:14,743
What the bloody hell is that?

487
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:16,049
I have no idea.

488
00:39:18,181 --> 00:39:20,183
Whoa! No!
Whoa.

489
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,055
Mikael! Mikael!

490
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:23,448
I'm working on it!

491
00:39:23,622 --> 00:39:24,797
Come on, you...

492
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:26,102
God!
Okay, okay, okay!

493
00:39:30,106 --> 00:39:31,151
The hell was that, Mikael?

494
00:39:31,325 --> 00:39:32,979
Calm down. Calm down.

495
00:39:33,153 --> 00:39:34,633
It must've been the signal.
The same electrical

496
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:35,764
disturbances were
happening at the outpost.

497
00:39:37,157 --> 00:39:38,985
Oh, come on. Come on.

498
00:39:43,946 --> 00:39:45,295
She says it's coming
from that ridge point.

499
00:39:51,214 --> 00:39:52,607
Well, let's take a look.

500
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:54,000
I'll get as close as I can.

501
00:40:10,277 --> 00:40:11,844
The Hollow Earth.

502
00:40:13,628 --> 00:40:17,153
A world untouched by mankind.

503
00:40:17,327 --> 00:40:19,634
Is this
how Neil Armstrong felt

504
00:40:19,808 --> 00:40:21,941
when he stepped on alien soil?

505
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:26,554
<i>Is this one small step for me,</i>

506
00:40:26,728 --> 00:40:27,816
<i>and one giant leap for...</i>

507
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,165
<i>Who are you talking to?</i>

508
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:30,819
Are you kidding me?

509
00:40:30,993 --> 00:40:32,691
Right down the lens?
It's a documentary.

510
00:40:32,865 --> 00:40:34,562
You wanna be natural.
Just walk, if you just walk.

511
00:40:34,736 --> 00:40:36,172
<i>- All right, just keep...
- Yeah, just... Okay. Take two.</i>

512
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:43,005
The Hollow Earth. A world...

513
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:45,007
All right, guys.
That ridge you pointed out

514
00:40:45,181 --> 00:40:46,661
is about two miles
straight ahead.

515
00:40:51,623 --> 00:40:52,885
I'm getting eaten alive
out here.

516
00:40:55,017 --> 00:40:58,151
Oh, look at that.
I must be tasty too.

517
00:40:59,152 --> 00:40:59,892
Kill it.

518
00:41:01,633 --> 00:41:04,200
Only female mosquitos
drink blood.

519
00:41:04,374 --> 00:41:05,680
So they can grow their eggs.

520
00:41:08,074 --> 00:41:09,423
She needs it more than me.

521
00:41:24,873 --> 00:41:27,049
Wait.

522
00:41:27,223 --> 00:41:29,704
What?
- What's the holdup?

523
00:41:29,878 --> 00:41:31,184
Not this way.

524
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:33,099
What? Why?

525
00:41:33,273 --> 00:41:34,579
Yeah, we gotta take a detour.
There's something here.

526
00:41:34,753 --> 00:41:36,885
Where, here? Like here, here?

527
00:41:37,059 --> 00:41:39,148
Hey.

528
00:41:39,322 --> 00:41:41,063
Nah. I'm not picking
anything up.

529
00:41:41,237 --> 00:41:42,456
No. Something
doesn't smell right,

530
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,066
and it's not just you, Mikael.

531
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,156
Can you smell that?
It's like rotting flesh.

532
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,332
It's probably
just a carcass upwind.

533
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,464
- We keep moving.
- Mikael, hold up.

534
00:41:50,638 --> 00:41:52,597
Listen, pal. I'm gonna trust

535
00:41:52,771 --> 00:41:54,599
my state of the art thermal
over your

536
00:41:54,773 --> 00:41:57,079
Ace Ventura
hippie-dippie sixth sense

537
00:41:57,253 --> 00:41:59,299
all day long. You got me?

538
00:41:59,473 --> 00:42:00,735
There's no need to call
people names. We're just...

539
00:42:00,909 --> 00:42:02,476
Hey. And as for you,
freak show,

540
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:04,347
if you don't shut it,
I'm gonna take that camera,

541
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,479
I'm gonna shove it
right up your arse.

542
00:42:05,653 --> 00:42:07,089
I'm in charge, we move.

543
00:42:07,263 --> 00:42:08,308
Why don't we just listen
to somebody calmer?

544
00:42:08,482 --> 00:42:09,744
I said I'm in charge.

545
00:42:09,918 --> 00:42:11,485
I'm in charge!

546
00:42:11,659 --> 00:42:12,834
Whoa!

547
00:42:13,008 --> 00:42:14,401
Run!

548
00:42:19,841 --> 00:42:20,973
It was a tree.
It was a tree!

549
00:42:21,147 --> 00:42:22,801
Wait, wait, wait.

550
00:42:22,975 --> 00:42:24,150
We should be all right.
We should be all right.

551
00:42:24,324 --> 00:42:25,412
Those things
don't reach that far.

552
00:42:25,586 --> 00:42:26,935
He was just eaten by a tree.

553
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:28,633
What you doing, Doc?

554
00:42:28,807 --> 00:42:30,330
I'm trying to call
the Base for extraction.

555
00:42:30,504 --> 00:42:31,810
It's just, one minute
he was there, right?

556
00:42:31,984 --> 00:42:32,985
He was right in my face.
And then, a tree!

557
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:33,942
- Outta nowhere!
- I know, man.

558
00:42:34,116 --> 00:42:35,291
I know. That's heavy.

559
00:42:35,465 --> 00:42:36,205
But that's
the natural world, man.

560
00:42:36,379 --> 00:42:37,555
"Red in tooth and claw."

561
00:42:37,729 --> 00:42:39,774
Tennyson.
You just watched a man

562
00:42:39,948 --> 00:42:41,515
get devoured
by a topiary nightmare,

563
00:42:41,689 --> 00:42:43,952
and you want to quote
Tennyson? Down here?

564
00:42:44,126 --> 00:42:46,955
Yeah. Yeah, man.
He knew all about it.

565
00:42:47,129 --> 00:42:48,783
"Let love clasp grief," man.
Come here.

566
00:42:48,957 --> 00:42:50,306
Mm.

567
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,481
You know, humans,
we think we took

568
00:42:51,656 --> 00:42:53,875
ourselves off the food chain,

569
00:42:54,049 --> 00:42:58,097
but maybe, maybe the Titans
are here to remind us.

570
00:43:00,012 --> 00:43:00,882
I think that
there is something

571
00:43:01,056 --> 00:43:02,101
seriously wrong with you.

572
00:43:03,537 --> 00:43:04,320
- Okay.
- Mm-kay.

573
00:43:04,494 --> 00:43:06,496
- Okay.
- Mm.

574
00:43:06,671 --> 00:43:08,542
It's not working.

575
00:43:08,716 --> 00:43:11,023
We better move on.
We'll mourn later.

576
00:43:12,851 --> 00:43:14,330
Jia. Come on.

577
00:43:14,504 --> 00:43:15,549
- Come on, bud.
- But the...

578
00:43:15,723 --> 00:43:18,073
He was eaten by a tree.

579
00:43:18,247 --> 00:43:19,814
I don't...
I don't want to die like that.

580
00:43:19,988 --> 00:43:20,815
Not by a tree.

581
00:43:30,825 --> 00:43:32,218
<i>Tower,</i>

582
00:43:32,392 --> 00:43:33,785
<i>we can't get
any closer than this.</i>

583
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:37,136
<i>Godzilla's burning hot
with radiation.</i>

584
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:39,486
<i>Whatever he's headed for
has him really pissed off.</i>

585
00:43:50,889 --> 00:43:51,846
<i>This is Base</i>

586
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,065
<i>calling Fifteen Alpha, over.</i>

587
00:43:55,763 --> 00:43:57,112
Fifteen Alpha responding.

588
00:43:57,286 --> 00:43:58,940
Godzilla's current trajectory
is showing

589
00:43:59,114 --> 00:44:00,725
<i>him heading
towards the Arctic Ocean.</i>

590
00:44:00,899 --> 00:44:02,161
What Titans are in the area?

591
00:44:06,469 --> 00:44:08,733
<i>Looks like
he's hunting Tiamat.</i>

592
00:44:08,907 --> 00:44:10,517
<i>Classified file three two four.</i>

593
00:44:10,691 --> 00:44:12,345
<i>Titanus Tiamat.</i>

594
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:14,042
<i>Titan nineteen.</i>

595
00:44:14,216 --> 00:44:16,915
<i>Extremely aggressive,
territorial.</i>

596
00:44:17,089 --> 00:44:19,918
<i>Weaponizing her body
of razor-sharp scales...</i>

597
00:44:20,092 --> 00:44:22,485
<i>Tiamat's Arctic lair
sits in the direct path</i>

598
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,401
<i>of electromagnetically charged
solar winds,</i>

599
00:44:25,575 --> 00:44:29,101
<i>making it the largest
stockpile of energy on Earth.</i>

600
00:44:29,275 --> 00:44:32,060
If Godzilla takes down Tiamat,
he'll supercharge.

601
00:44:40,982 --> 00:44:41,853
It's ruins.

602
00:44:42,984 --> 00:44:44,551
Human civilization?

603
00:44:45,421 --> 00:44:46,422
Down here?

604
00:44:50,557 --> 00:44:51,297
Hey.

605
00:44:56,258 --> 00:44:58,434
Yeah.

606
00:44:58,608 --> 00:45:00,088
The markings are older
than the ones

607
00:45:00,262 --> 00:45:01,786
on Skull Island.
Centuries older.

608
00:45:06,138 --> 00:45:08,227
But the architecture is
consistent with the Iwi.

609
00:45:26,593 --> 00:45:27,594
Whoa.

610
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:42,348
Oh, this is remarkable.

611
00:45:51,705 --> 00:45:53,446
Now, that's weird.

612
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:56,449
There's no moss on these ones.

613
00:46:03,499 --> 00:46:04,283
Hello.

614
00:46:10,637 --> 00:46:12,204
Mothra.

615
00:46:12,378 --> 00:46:15,511
Queen of the monsters.
In Hollow Earth.

616
00:46:15,685 --> 00:46:17,513
Her lineage must go
back further than we thought.

617
00:46:26,044 --> 00:46:27,001
Yeah.

618
00:46:46,064 --> 00:46:46,804
No, no, no.

619
00:46:55,203 --> 00:46:55,856
What is that? Whoa!

620
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:04,256
Hey!

621
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:05,866
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

622
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,047
It's like some kind of
a irrigation system.

623
00:47:13,221 --> 00:47:14,875
Only this predates everything

624
00:47:15,049 --> 00:47:16,398
Mesopotamians,
the Lemurians...

625
00:47:16,572 --> 00:47:18,574
I mean, these guys
were the first, man!

626
00:47:21,229 --> 00:47:23,057
Jia.
It just keeps going.

627
00:47:23,231 --> 00:47:25,277
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Oh. Sorry.

628
00:47:25,451 --> 00:47:27,366
Oh, whoa.
What the...?

629
00:47:28,802 --> 00:47:31,065
Now, that is a trip.

630
00:47:31,239 --> 00:47:32,893
Great Mulder and Scully,
look at that.

631
00:47:34,939 --> 00:47:36,897
What could have created this?

632
00:47:37,071 --> 00:47:38,551
<i>Ancient alien astronauts.</i>

633
00:47:38,725 --> 00:47:39,769
Yeah.

634
00:47:43,425 --> 00:47:44,687
Look at this here.

635
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,428
The water's
running underneath.

636
00:47:46,602 --> 00:47:47,865
And this is organic.

637
00:47:55,568 --> 00:47:56,395
Yeah.

638
00:48:00,007 --> 00:48:02,053
Some kind of bioelectric hub.

639
00:48:09,974 --> 00:48:12,672
It's like camouflage.

640
00:48:12,846 --> 00:48:13,847
Wow.

641
00:48:20,027 --> 00:48:21,724
Should she be doing that?

642
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:22,856
She shouldn't be doing that,
right? Should she...?

643
00:48:42,484 --> 00:48:44,573
This must be
the source of the signal.

644
00:48:44,747 --> 00:48:46,314
Oh, we've gotta
check this out.

645
00:48:46,488 --> 00:48:47,272
Yeah.

646
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,191
Okay. Go, go, go. Go.

647
00:53:31,382 --> 00:53:32,948
<i>Fifteen Alpha reporting
to base.</i>

648
00:53:33,122 --> 00:53:35,299
<i>We're entering
Tiamat's domain,</i>

649
00:53:35,473 --> 00:53:37,431
but something is off.

650
00:53:37,605 --> 00:53:39,825
Tiamat's energy
is distorting our radar.

651
00:53:39,999 --> 00:53:40,956
<i>We don't have a visual
on Godzilla.</i>

652
00:53:42,567 --> 00:53:44,438
Take us forward,
silent running...

653
00:53:44,612 --> 00:53:45,613
- Yes, sir.
- ...five knots.

654
00:53:57,146 --> 00:53:57,843
Mayday!
- Get that out!

655
00:54:53,594 --> 00:54:54,943
Get that out!

656
00:54:55,117 --> 00:54:56,249
I need a status report!

657
00:54:56,423 --> 00:54:57,772
That's right.

658
00:54:57,946 --> 00:54:58,295
He's gone to Tiamat's lair.

659
00:55:13,875 --> 00:55:14,920
Wait, wait, wait.

660
00:55:21,927 --> 00:55:23,232
Wait, what did she say?

661
00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:24,582
She says we're not alone.

662
00:55:24,756 --> 00:55:26,323
See? I knew it.
I knew I felt something.

663
00:55:30,196 --> 00:55:31,197
Come on, then.

664
00:55:37,072 --> 00:55:38,726
Go.

665
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,946
Oh, my God.

666
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,426
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

667
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,340
It's going away.
It's going away. Okay.

668
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:11,803
Oh, my God.

669
00:56:13,065 --> 00:56:14,501
Oh, my God.

670
00:56:22,596 --> 00:56:23,597
What?

671
00:56:25,338 --> 00:56:27,296
It's an entire
Iwi civilization,

672
00:56:27,471 --> 00:56:28,602
protected within Hollow Earth.

673
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:31,823
These structures,
they look like they've been

674
00:56:31,997 --> 00:56:34,608
carved from
some enormous quartz crystal.

675
00:56:34,782 --> 00:56:36,262
That must be
their energy source.

676
00:56:36,436 --> 00:56:37,959
I'm feeling the energy,

677
00:56:38,133 --> 00:56:38,569
but let's just keep it
together, all right?

678
00:56:50,668 --> 00:56:54,976
Oh, my God.
It's an undocumented vortex.

679
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:56,848
Looks like several of them, actually.

680
00:56:57,022 --> 00:56:58,632
Routes to the surface.

681
00:56:58,806 --> 00:57:00,504
These could lead
all over the Earth.

682
00:57:00,678 --> 00:57:02,419
Oh, wow.
That's incredible.

683
00:57:05,987 --> 00:57:07,119
You should make
eye contact with them.

684
00:57:07,293 --> 00:57:08,816
It's considered polite.

685
00:57:11,602 --> 00:57:13,517
Yeah, this is not
working for me.

686
00:57:14,996 --> 00:57:17,129
Oh.

687
00:57:39,847 --> 00:57:41,849
How are they communicating?

688
00:57:42,023 --> 00:57:43,155
Telepathically.

689
00:57:52,817 --> 00:57:54,427
Okay. No, I, no,
no, no. You can't take her.

690
00:57:54,601 --> 00:57:55,733
I think she's taking her
to the...

691
00:57:55,907 --> 00:57:57,256
Well, let me come!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

692
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:58,126
Hold on, okay,
we're not resisting.

693
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,650
Wait, wait, wait.

694
00:57:59,824 --> 00:58:00,912
I don't know where
she's taking her! Hey!

695
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:09,486
Okay.

696
00:59:09,023 --> 00:59:09,720
- Okay, come on. Okay.
- Let's go, let's go.

697
00:59:17,379 --> 00:59:18,729
Whoa. Oh.

698
00:59:27,433 --> 00:59:28,434
Can I?

699
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:31,611
Thank you.

700
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:35,484
Of course.

701
00:59:35,659 --> 00:59:36,311
What's she saying, Doc?

702
00:59:39,053 --> 00:59:40,664
The beacon that we've been
following, it's...

703
00:59:43,057 --> 00:59:44,668
It's the Iwi calling for help.

704
00:59:46,147 --> 00:59:49,455
Oh. Whoa.

705
00:59:57,158 --> 01:00:01,206
So, wait. They send out
this SOS, and then what?

706
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:02,468
Godzilla hears it?

707
01:00:02,642 --> 01:00:04,992
Yeah. They woke him up.

708
01:00:05,166 --> 01:00:06,733
An SOS for what?
They already live

709
01:00:06,907 --> 01:00:08,082
in a nightmare
monster hellscape.

710
01:00:08,256 --> 01:00:09,693
What could possibly
scare them?

711
01:00:09,867 --> 01:00:11,346
Hey. She can understand
everything that you say.

712
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,827
- She understands me?
- Oh, good.

713
01:00:14,001 --> 01:00:15,699
And a nightmare
monster hellscape

714
01:00:15,873 --> 01:00:18,484
is a wonderful place
to raise a family.

715
01:01:16,281 --> 01:01:18,587
Oh, wow.

716
01:01:18,762 --> 01:01:20,894
This whole room
is covered in Iwi script.

717
01:01:26,291 --> 01:01:29,120
It says that in the beginning,

718
01:01:29,294 --> 01:01:32,819
Hollow Earth lived in harmony
with the surface world.

719
01:01:32,993 --> 01:01:36,475
The Titans were
the guardians of nature

720
01:01:36,649 --> 01:01:39,783
and the Great Apes became
the protectors of humanity.

721
01:01:44,309 --> 01:01:46,267
But a great evil
threatened the peace.

722
01:01:46,441 --> 01:01:49,488
A powerful and ruthless ape

723
01:01:49,662 --> 01:01:52,012
desperate to conquer
the surface world,

724
01:01:52,186 --> 01:01:55,755
led his tribe into war
against the one they call...

725
01:01:55,929 --> 01:01:57,714
The Monster Who Ate a Star.

726
01:01:58,366 --> 01:01:59,411
Godzilla.

727
01:02:00,542 --> 01:02:02,196
There's more.

728
01:02:02,370 --> 01:02:04,546
The war with the Apes
nearly destroyed Godzilla.

729
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,461
But after a great battle,

730
01:02:06,635 --> 01:02:07,811
he imprisoned the apes

731
01:02:07,985 --> 01:02:10,117
in a fiery realm
of Hollow Earth.

732
01:02:10,291 --> 01:02:12,685
Their false king
remains obsessed

733
01:02:12,859 --> 01:02:14,382
with reaching the surface.

734
01:02:14,556 --> 01:02:17,472
The Iwi call him
the Skar King.

735
01:10:03,851 --> 01:10:05,766
<i>Trapped within
their subterranean realm,</i>

736
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:08,508
<i>the Skar King harnessed
a terrible power.</i>

737
01:10:08,682 --> 01:10:10,989
<i>The ancient Titan, Shimo.</i>

738
01:10:15,472 --> 01:10:18,649
He controls her
with pain.

739
01:10:18,823 --> 01:10:20,651
Her power covered the Earth
in the last ice age.

740
01:10:23,175 --> 01:10:24,959
We brought Kong down here.

741
01:10:25,133 --> 01:10:26,657
He's been looking
for others like himself,

742
01:10:26,831 --> 01:10:28,311
going deeper
into Hollow Earth

743
01:10:28,485 --> 01:10:30,748
and getting closer
to their prison.

744
01:10:30,922 --> 01:10:32,880
The Iwi must have known
it was just a matter of time,

745
01:10:33,054 --> 01:10:34,795
and that's why they've been

746
01:10:34,969 --> 01:10:38,016
calling for help, and that's
why Godzilla's changing.

747
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:39,670
He's gearing up
for World War Three.

748
01:10:39,844 --> 01:10:41,454
Okay, but he barely survived
last time.

749
01:10:41,628 --> 01:10:43,108
What's Godzilla
gonna do on his own?

750
01:10:45,197 --> 01:10:48,244
He won't be on his own.

751
01:10:48,418 --> 01:10:51,072
The Iwi believe
that at the end of the world,

752
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,640
one of their own
will return...

753
01:10:53,814 --> 01:10:57,078
and awaken Mothra,
defender of the Iwi...

754
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:59,820
and ancient ally of Godzilla.

755
01:10:59,994 --> 01:11:02,040
They believe
that their savior will be

756
01:11:02,214 --> 01:11:03,607
an Iwi from Skull Island.

757
01:11:07,001 --> 01:11:08,873
That seems like a lot
to put on one kid.

758
01:13:23,268 --> 01:13:24,530
<i>This is
Monarch Air Team to Base,</i>

759
01:13:24,704 --> 01:13:26,663
<i>tracking over
Godzilla's location.</i>

760
01:13:26,837 --> 01:13:29,405
<i>We've closed the shipping lanes
within 300 miles.</i>

761
01:13:29,579 --> 01:13:33,147
<i>Plasma readings indicate he's
absorbing everything in there.</i>

762
01:13:49,773 --> 01:13:50,730
You know, I made
a deal with myself

763
01:13:50,904 --> 01:13:53,080
when I became a mother.

764
01:13:53,254 --> 01:13:56,344
I said to myself, "I don't care
what you have to sacrifice...

765
01:13:56,519 --> 01:13:59,696
what you have to give up,

766
01:13:59,870 --> 01:14:01,654
you will do right
by that little girl."

767
01:14:05,049 --> 01:14:06,529
I just never thought that

768
01:14:06,703 --> 01:14:09,096
the thing I'd be giving up
would be her.

769
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:10,663
Look, you don't know that.

770
01:14:10,837 --> 01:14:11,838
Really?

771
01:14:12,012 --> 01:14:13,536
Trapper, before we came here

772
01:14:13,710 --> 01:14:16,756
she said that
she didn't belong anywhere.

773
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:19,759
If this is the life
that she wants,

774
01:14:19,933 --> 01:14:21,369
then I have to give her up.

775
01:14:32,032 --> 01:14:33,556
Am I having
a funny turn

776
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:34,687
or does everything feel
lighter down here?

777
01:14:36,733 --> 01:14:37,734
Wait, wait, wait.

778
01:14:41,085 --> 01:14:43,261
What are they doing?
That must weigh a ton.

779
01:14:43,435 --> 01:14:44,697
Yeah. Yeah, see,

780
01:14:44,871 --> 01:14:46,743
I don't know
how they can do it...

781
01:14:46,917 --> 01:14:48,179
but somehow they're able to
move the pyramids' positions,

782
01:14:48,353 --> 01:14:49,702
which disrupts the

783
01:14:49,876 --> 01:14:51,574
gravitational pull
down here,

784
01:14:51,748 --> 01:14:53,532
and that's how
they run their city.

785
01:14:53,706 --> 01:14:55,273
<i>An entire civilization</i>

786
01:14:55,447 --> 01:14:57,057
<i>built off the manipulation
of gravity.</i>

787
01:14:57,231 --> 01:14:59,582
God, I wish
was streaming this live!

788
01:14:59,756 --> 01:15:00,757
What you gonna do
with that, Bern?

789
01:15:02,889 --> 01:15:04,717
Look, I know
what you're thinking,

790
01:15:04,891 --> 01:15:06,893
but you don't understand.
Okay?

791
01:15:07,067 --> 01:15:08,025
To have been through
what I've been through,

792
01:15:08,199 --> 01:15:09,679
seen what I seen

793
01:15:09,853 --> 01:15:11,028
and have absolutely
nobody believe you.

794
01:15:13,291 --> 01:15:15,598
This place...

795
01:15:15,772 --> 01:15:19,166
This place is special, man.
It's magic.

796
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:20,907
How long do you think
it'll stay like that

797
01:15:21,081 --> 01:15:23,170
if you start posting that
about, hmm?

798
01:15:23,344 --> 01:15:26,739
Like, you look at any isolated
tribe or community,

799
01:15:26,913 --> 01:15:28,436
how many of them

800
01:15:28,611 --> 01:15:29,699
survive contact with
the outside world, hmm?

801
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:35,139
You know I think
you're brilliant, don't you?

802
01:15:35,313 --> 01:15:37,097
You already saved
the world once.

803
01:15:37,271 --> 01:15:38,403
Can't take that away from you.

804
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,363
Could you say that all again?

805
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,235
The last part,
so I have it on footage.

806
01:15:44,409 --> 01:15:45,584
What?

807
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:50,546
<i>Oh, well, we have to find out
what that was, right?</i>

808
01:16:28,192 --> 01:16:28,932
Oh, my God.

809
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:39,333
Is that a mini-Kong?

810
01:16:41,684 --> 01:16:42,989
How did they find this place?

811
01:16:43,163 --> 01:16:44,512
He must have sensed Jia.

812
01:17:40,046 --> 01:17:41,265
That arm looks bad.

813
01:17:41,439 --> 01:17:43,528
Yeah. That's worse than bad.

814
01:17:44,529 --> 01:17:45,530
That's frostbite.

815
01:17:50,796 --> 01:17:51,884
I'd better go take a look.

816
01:19:21,539 --> 01:19:23,541
<i>Warning, detecting
altered energy signature.</i>

817
01:19:23,715 --> 01:19:26,457
Oh, my God.
He's changed.

818
01:19:33,072 --> 01:19:35,945
I know, I know.
Nobody likes a dentist.

819
01:19:37,903 --> 01:19:39,644
Let's get a look
at that arm, big guy.

820
01:19:43,996 --> 01:19:45,737
Trapper, he looks really hurt.

821
01:19:45,911 --> 01:19:48,871
Yeah, it's not great.
I'm seeing nerve damage...

822
01:19:49,045 --> 01:19:51,438
<i>significant tissue loss.</i>

823
01:19:51,612 --> 01:19:53,397
<i>So, what are we saying?</i>

824
01:19:53,571 --> 01:19:56,400
He's not gonna last a day down
here with only one arm.

825
01:19:56,574 --> 01:19:58,924
Yeah, communication
to the surface is still out.

826
01:19:59,098 --> 01:20:00,404
If I can get back
to the outpost,

827
01:20:00,578 --> 01:20:01,535
I think there might be
some supplies

828
01:20:01,709 --> 01:20:03,581
<i>that we can use.</i>

829
01:20:03,755 --> 01:20:05,061
I don't think a massive cast
is gonna solve the problem.

830
01:20:05,235 --> 01:20:08,107
I wasn't talkin'
plaster of Paris.

831
01:20:08,281 --> 01:20:09,848
<i>I'm thinking
more along the lines of, uh...</i>

832
01:20:12,111 --> 01:20:13,417
Project Powerhouse.

833
01:20:14,897 --> 01:20:15,767
You can't be serious?

834
01:20:15,941 --> 01:20:18,030
Oh, I'm deadly serious.

835
01:20:18,204 --> 01:20:19,858
That prototype
was almost finished

836
01:20:20,032 --> 01:20:21,555
when they pulled the funding.

837
01:20:21,729 --> 01:20:23,427
All right, well, what are you
still doing here?

838
01:20:23,601 --> 01:20:25,995
I love you, too, Doc.

839
01:20:26,169 --> 01:20:28,693
Project Powerhouse, what is...
what is that, exactly?

840
01:20:31,914 --> 01:20:33,524
<i>After Mechagodzilla,</i>

841
01:20:33,698 --> 01:20:34,612
<i>we realized that there were
some threats that</i>

842
01:20:34,786 --> 01:20:36,440
<i>even Kong couldn't face.</i>

843
01:20:36,614 --> 01:20:40,879
So, we started working on some
minor augmentations.

844
01:20:41,053 --> 01:20:43,229
Oh.

845
01:20:43,403 --> 01:20:44,840
Wait, what kind of
augmentations?

846
01:20:48,278 --> 01:20:49,757
<i>Making one of
the strongest Titans</i>

847
01:20:49,932 --> 01:20:51,759
<i>even stronger
didn't go over so well.</i>

848
01:20:51,934 --> 01:20:53,022
<i>So, we got shut down.</i>

849
01:20:56,939 --> 01:20:58,766
<i>Lucky for us, the prototype</i>

850
01:20:58,941 --> 01:21:01,944
<i>had already been transported
to Hollow Earth for testing.</i>

851
01:21:02,118 --> 01:21:05,730
<i>It's stored in the armory
at Outpost One.</i>

852
01:21:20,353 --> 01:21:24,967
<i>♪ Tonight, I want

01:21:30,450 --> 01:21:33,889
<i>♪ There's so much

857
01:21:42,985 --> 01:21:44,073
Woo-hoo!

858
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:47,554
<i>What do you think of that?</i>

859
01:21:47,728 --> 01:21:49,687
That's one hell of an
augmentation there, Trapper.

860
01:21:49,861 --> 01:21:51,907
<i>Only the best for Mr. Kong.</i>

861
01:22:15,974 --> 01:22:17,367
All right, it's ready to go.

862
01:22:20,413 --> 01:22:22,502
Those injections should heal
the frostbite up nicely.

863
01:22:32,338 --> 01:22:34,036
All right, there he goes.

864
01:22:34,210 --> 01:22:35,167
He's moving.

865
01:22:39,867 --> 01:22:40,564
You got this.

866
01:22:50,226 --> 01:22:51,792
Look, it's a bit rough
and ready, but it should hold.

867
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:52,880
It's good.
It looks good, Trapper.

868
01:22:53,055 --> 01:22:54,012
Damn good.

869
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:03,935
- Here we go.
- Yeah.

870
01:23:04,109 --> 01:23:05,415
He's either gonna love it

871
01:23:05,589 --> 01:23:06,677
or he's gonna rip it off
with his teeth.

872
01:23:13,771 --> 01:23:16,382
I think
he loves it! Yeah?

873
01:23:38,752 --> 01:23:39,753
Skar King.

874
01:23:45,455 --> 01:23:47,196
Hey, hey!
What did you tell him?

875
01:23:50,286 --> 01:23:51,896
Oh.

876
01:23:53,245 --> 01:23:54,812
Where's he going?

877
01:23:54,986 --> 01:23:57,119
Godzilla won't come down here
unless Kong brings him.

878
01:23:57,293 --> 01:23:58,468
Okay, the last time
those two met up

879
01:23:58,642 --> 01:24:00,339
it was almost the end of Kong.

880
01:24:00,513 --> 01:24:01,645
He is taking a hell of a risk.

881
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:07,129
If Kong invades his turf,
could start a war.

882
01:24:07,303 --> 01:24:09,609
Yeah, that's
a suicide mission.

883
01:24:09,783 --> 01:24:12,047
But if Kong draws Godzilla
down here...

884
01:24:12,221 --> 01:24:14,266
they can make their stand
in Hollow Earth

885
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:16,442
and then there's
a chance that

886
01:24:16,616 --> 01:24:18,444
Godzilla can stop
Skar King and Shimo

887
01:24:18,618 --> 01:24:19,445
from reaching the surface.

888
01:26:20,436 --> 01:26:22,264
We are absolutely certain

889
01:26:22,438 --> 01:26:24,570
that she can pull this off, right?

890
01:26:24,744 --> 01:26:26,659
It's why Jia was called here.

891
01:26:26,833 --> 01:26:30,141
Only an Iwi from Skull Island
can awaken Mothra.

892
01:26:30,315 --> 01:26:32,143
And Mothra is the key
to Godzilla

893
01:26:32,317 --> 01:26:33,579
protecting this place,

894
01:26:33,753 --> 01:26:35,538
and its pathways
to the surface.

895
01:26:43,981 --> 01:26:45,156
She's gonna be all right.

896
01:26:45,330 --> 01:26:45,939
- Uh-huh.
- She's gonna be all right.

897
01:27:46,696 --> 01:27:48,959
Hey, she's evacuating
the villagers.

898
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:55,052
Gravity! Gravity!
The pyramids and gravity.

899
01:27:55,226 --> 01:27:57,054
Yeah, I got it! I got it now!

900
01:27:57,228 --> 01:27:58,621
Tell me on the way.
Come on, come on!

901
01:27:58,795 --> 01:28:00,536
While we are throwing
random shit at the wall,

902
01:28:00,710 --> 01:28:03,495
permission to take the HEAV?
Rally some reinforcements.

903
01:28:03,669 --> 01:28:05,062
To the surface?
No, there's no time.

904
01:28:05,236 --> 01:28:07,847
No, this idea's
way weirder than that.

905
01:31:37,230 --> 01:31:38,797
All right,
we're underneath the pyramids.

906
01:31:38,971 --> 01:31:40,233
Now what?

907
01:31:40,407 --> 01:31:42,105
Gravity.

908
01:31:42,279 --> 01:31:43,236
Iwi technology.

909
01:31:57,294 --> 01:31:58,861
With the chemical reaction,

910
01:31:59,035 --> 01:32:01,167
this liquid metal becomes
an engineering mechanism

911
01:32:01,341 --> 01:32:03,605
forcing the two
electromagnetic pyramids

912
01:32:03,779 --> 01:32:05,911
together, causing
an anti-gravity shock wave.

913
01:32:06,085 --> 01:32:08,435
But only for a few minutes.
Or maybe less.

914
01:32:08,610 --> 01:32:10,742
Which should keep those
things from the portals.

915
01:32:10,916 --> 01:32:12,831
After that,
everything that is up

916
01:32:13,005 --> 01:32:14,050
will come crashing down.

917
01:32:32,938 --> 01:32:34,418
They're here.

918
01:32:59,530 --> 01:33:00,792
We're not gonna make it.
There's not enough time.

919
01:33:00,966 --> 01:33:01,924
We need something
to slow them down.

920
01:33:02,098 --> 01:33:03,490
Yeah, but what else can we do?

921
01:33:05,492 --> 01:33:07,233
<i>It's vertacine mating season.</i>

922
01:33:10,106 --> 01:33:11,890
No way.

923
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:14,632

924
01:33:16,591 --> 01:33:18,157

926
01:33:31,170 --> 01:33:32,171
I'm gonna kiss you
on the mouth!

927
01:33:32,345 --> 01:33:33,042
Come on. Go, go.

928
01:33:36,436 --> 01:33:38,221
Buckle up,
you beautiful people.

929
01:33:38,395 --> 01:33:40,266
Up and away. Yes!

930
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:42,660

<i>No! The engine's out.</i>

933
01:34:43,416 --> 01:34:44,417
The gravity surge
must have taken out

934
01:34:44,591 --> 01:34:46,419
the power-battery-thing.

935
01:35:23,413 --> 01:35:25,328
Yes! Yes!

936
01:35:25,502 --> 01:35:26,721
She's protecting the portals.

937
01:36:38,531 --> 01:36:39,837
Oh, God!

938
01:36:48,890 --> 01:36:51,675
Oh.

939
01:43:43,086 --> 01:43:44,130
Look.

940
01:43:46,045 --> 01:43:48,222
Jia, you're safe! Come here.

941
01:44:06,631 --> 01:44:07,632

942
01:44:38,750 --> 01:44:39,490

943
01:44:52,808 --> 01:44:53,809

944
01:45:13,219 --> 01:45:14,003

945
01:45:14,177 --> 01:45:16,005
