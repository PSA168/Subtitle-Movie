1
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:46,411
Elder Luna says
make your heart still.

2
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,496
The right egg
will sing to you.

3
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,583
Elder Luna is elder.

4
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,439
Three.

5
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,067
Only three.

6
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,153
We take them all.

7
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,529
No. Never.

8
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,615
Leave one always.

9
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,577
That is the law.

10
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,831
Bonding day is tomorrow.

11
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,877
These are yours.

12
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,755
You are older.

13
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,758
-By length of a sunset.
-Is older.

14
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:45,803
Soona.

15
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,182
Which one sings to you?

16
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,313
This one.

17
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,694
Silk.

18
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,958
We will raise them together.

19
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,003
Like we were raised.

20
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,548
It will be the same.

21
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,927
Yes?

22
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,941
Go, go, go.

23
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,277
- Noa!
- Noa, wait!

24
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,290
Whoa!

25
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,168
It's too far.

26
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,586
Find another way.

27
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:05,883
Noa?

28
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,428
No!

29
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,932
Yeah!

30
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,107
Noa!

31
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,403
Anaya! Soona!

32
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:08,946
Noa!

33
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,118
- Noa!
- No!

34
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,353
Do you wonder
what your bird will look like?

35
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,855
Long as it does not
look like you, Anaya.

36
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,051
What is it, Noa?

37
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,595
Something in trees.

38
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,238
It's getting away.

39
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,921
Noa scared.

40
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,009
Not Anaya.

41
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,909
Not ape.

42
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,373
Maybe...

43
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,751
Echo?

44
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:33,549
Echo do not come in
from Valley.

45
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:34,884
Oh.

46
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,196
Were you scared?

47
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,239
Not as scared as Anaya!

48
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,394
They're back!
They're back!

49
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,478
Soona!

50
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,646
Did you
get your eggs?

51
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,232
-How far did you climb?
-Was it dangerous?

52
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,526
Very dangerous.

53
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,153
Anaya wailed like a newborn.

54
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,997
How many eggs
did you honor?

55
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,499
- Show us the egg.
- Did you climb well?

56
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,334
- Show us the egg.
- Show us your egg.

57
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,419
Egg. Egg. Egg.

58
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,131
Show us, Anaya, please?

59
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,697
- Who want?
- Me, me, me!

60
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,491
Aw!

61
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:26,036
Come on.
Come on. Give, give! Hey!

62
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:27,621
Son.

63
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,173
Show me.

64
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,467
All must wait for bonding.

65
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:42,219
Even Honored Teacher.

66
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,096
I am your mother.

67
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:56,233
I knew you would climb well.

68
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,029
He waits.

69
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,623
Broken?

70
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,169
Time for that later.

71
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:21,467
Your father will want to see.

72
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,245
- Noa.
- Noa.

73
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:52,289
Noa, didn't
think you'd make it back.

74
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,615
Too firm.

75
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,034
Yes. Yes, Koro.

76
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,314
Noa.

77
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,318
Son.

78
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:13,162
Sun Eagle does not like work
for tomorrow's ceremony.

79
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,041
You climb well?

80
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,627
Above Top Nest.

81
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,837
Huh. All of you?

82
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,505
No.

83
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:24,965
Only me.

84
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,765
What that smell?

85
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:46,570
You did not go
to the Valley Beyond?

86
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,988
Never.

87
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,199
Is forbidden.

88
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:55,287
Yet blood of Echo
on your blanket.

89
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,540
We did not go
to Valley Beyond.

90
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,129
I accept.

91
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,508
You are true, Noa.

92
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,761
Much to learn.

93
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,764
Much to teach.

94
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,518
After tomorrow's bonding.

95
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,271
Now, Elders must know.

96
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,484
Echoes only bring trouble.

97
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,408
Oda will chase the pests away.

98
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,918
May I seek your counsel?

99
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:50,426
This blanket had the blood
of an Echo on it.

100
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,635
Echo.

101
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,178
And I apologize
for that.

102
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,473
This is a bad sign
for all of us.

103
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,558
That smell.

104
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,684
And my suggestion
would be...

105
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,360
You climbed Top Nest?

106
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,074
Hard climb.

107
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,498
Ah, yes.

108
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,751
Could be dangerous.

109
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:24,835
Danger.

110
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:30,716
Anaya!

111
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,639
You see your father?

112
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,900
I do not understand Eagle Sun.

113
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,652
I do. He hate Noa.

114
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,326
Noa.

115
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,205
With Elders.

116
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,043
They send Oda
to scare Echo away.

117
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:07,878
Yes, Elder.

118
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,757
When mother was small...

119
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,968
dry season shrank creek.

120
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,470
Echo range for food.

121
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,849
She saw a small and a big.

122
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,686
We have good rain.

123
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,439
Her words.

124
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,030
Ride true, Oda.

125
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,309
No.

126
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,986
Our bonding is at sunrise.

127
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,863
Master of Birds
will make exception.

128
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:24,992
They will not make him wait
for next season.

129
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,368
Yes, he will.

130
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,330
He is your father.

131
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:34,418
And I am his son.

132
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,005
Then I will wait with you.

133
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,301
Anaya wait too.

134
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,429
You cannot.

135
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,604
I must find another.

136
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:44,756
Noa.

137
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,550
Oda!

138
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,344
There are...

139
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,139
more.

140
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,435
What happened here?

141
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,103
Our scouts.

142
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,772
Killed by him.

143
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,115
Human.

144
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,618
It is her.

145
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,244
Lightning, back on your horse.

146
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,621
Spread out!

147
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,956
Find his clan.

148
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,583
Search in all directions!

149
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,259
The ape's horse!

150
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,636
Lightning, come!

151
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,606
They cannot be far.

152
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:27,567
Follow the horse!
Find his clan!

153
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,737
Find human!

154
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:32,781
Ride!

155
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,079
Go, go, go!

156
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,975
Round them up!

157
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,602
No! No! Please!

158
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,857
You, prisoner!

159
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:54,404
Burn it down.

160
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,659
Soona! Anaya!

161
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:00,827
Noa, help!

162
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,464
Noa!

163
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,924
Noa!

164
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,134
Noa!

165
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:17,844
Noa!

166
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,305
Noa!

167
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,558
Anaya! Mother!

168
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:26,561
Where Soona?

169
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,563
They took her.

170
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,523
They broke my egg.

171
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:32,859
Mother.

172
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,194
Help your father!

173
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,571
No! No!

174
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:38,865
Noa!

175
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,326
No!

176
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,205
Run, Noa! Run!

177
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,249
Help your father!

178
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,126
Go, Noa! Run!

179
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,630
No!

180
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,511
He their Elder.

181
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,686
No!

182
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,571
For Caesar!

183
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,281
For Caesar!

184
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,953
Take them to Proximus!

185
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,206
Find the human!

186
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,959
Caesar! Caesar!

187
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:34,295
Caesar! Caesar!

188
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,434
-Father.
-Son.

189
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,144
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

190
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,104
Noa, free all birds.

191
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:52,439
Go.

192
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:31,728
Bend your head.

193
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,498
Noa.

194
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,131
For Caesar.

195
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:22,977
Father...

196
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,774
I will find them.

197
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,528
I will bring them home.

198
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,603
Mother.

199
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,383
Sun.

200
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,184
Come, Sun.

201
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,939
How young you are.

202
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,859
Without your mask.

203
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,445
Without this.

204
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:09,865
Speak up.

205
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,328
Speak up.

206
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,455
Not mine.

207
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:18,874
No mask.

208
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,335
I am not...

209
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,546
them.

210
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:27,967
Explain yourself.

211
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,512
They killed my father.

212
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,557
Stole my village.

213
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,477
I follow their tracks.

214
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,524
Hmm.

215
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:53,492
He was my village.

216
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,706
They killed him.

217
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,500
The Masks.

218
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,347
I am Raka.

219
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,519
I am Noa.

220
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:36,994
Apes falling
from the sky. Hmm.

221
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:45,211
He was outside
when they arrived.

222
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:47,129
Did you see my clan?

223
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,340
No.

224
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,634
I hid.

225
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,220
I survived.

226
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,766
I protected our work.

227
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:13,781
They are an ancient way
to store ideas.

228
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,497
The symbols have meaning.

229
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:28,796
Apes understood
this meaning...

230
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,881
in the time of Caesar.

231
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:36,887
The Masks, in my village...

232
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,391
said that name...

233
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,811
"Caesar."

234
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,230
Shameful.

235
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,525
The Masks take his name.

236
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:52,403
Twist his words.

237
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,030
Who is he?

238
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:56,949
Not "is."

239
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,076
"Was."

240
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:07,876
Your clan does not know
the true Caesar.

241
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:11,130
Too many have forgotten
who he was.

242
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:16,176
I know Elders of my village.

243
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:18,053
They made the law.

244
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:21,181
That is everything.

245
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:24,101
That is not everything.

246
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,104
Long before your Elders...

247
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:31,525
it was Caesar who taught us
what it means to be ape.

248
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:36,155
He was our leader,
our lawgiver.

249
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:39,074
Apes together strong.

250
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,952
Ape shall not kill ape.

251
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:44,872
We, the Order of Caesar...

252
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,790
follow his words.

253
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:48,292
To this day...

254
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,128
I follow.

255
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,089
I am now...

256
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:56,842
the last.

257
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,846
The work continues.

258
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:07,061
What is this place?

259
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:10,064
We believe apes built this...

260
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:13,776
as a refuge for humans.

261
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,819
Now it is rare
to see even one.

262
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:21,158
But in Caesar's time,
there were vast herds of them.

263
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,953
Can you imagine?

264
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:29,667
Perhaps here,
humans were cared for, fed...

265
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:33,504
maybe even taught.

266
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,095
What is it?

267
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:44,139
Echo.

268
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:49,520
Human.

269
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:53,816
You have seen one?

270
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,651
One.

271
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,780
They are scavengers.

272
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,657
Like boars.

273
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,450
Only lesser.

274
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:07,162
Humans are slow-witted, but...

275
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:11,125
there was a time...

276
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:15,087
when humans and apes
lived side by side.

277
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:24,263
Yes, it is a puzzle.
I know. But...

278
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:28,475
they were important
to Caesar. Hmm.

279
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:32,646
So they are important to me.

280
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,236
I have to get to my horse.

281
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:42,197
Of course.

282
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,407
Follow me.

283
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,788
You do not know Caesar.

284
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:53,667
You do not know books.

285
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,798
You should stay here.

286
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,342
There is much
I could teach you.

287
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,393
Go away!

288
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,896
-No! Come back!
-Pest!

289
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:16,064
Wait! Come back!

290
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:19,860
There is no danger.

291
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:23,030
That is the one.

292
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:25,491
Stole from my village.

293
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:30,287
She follows you
from your village?

294
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:38,754
Perhaps Caesar bids me travel.

295
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,636
Wait here. The work continues.

296
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:46,970
I have no time for...

297
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:50,224
I will not slow you down.
I, too, keep a horse.

298
00:46:57,439 --> 00:47:00,275
Can we not slow down?

299
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:01,318
No.

300
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,573
I am sure she follows.

301
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,325
I do not know why.

302
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:16,375
A beautiful bird!

303
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:20,128
Eagle Sun.

304
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,673
My father's bird.

305
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,717
He follows to taunt me.

306
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:30,764
This bird follows you too?

307
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:35,227
We raise eagles, my clan.

308
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,020
Sing to them...

309
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,481
so they know us.

310
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,691
A bond.

311
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,194
Sing the song.

312
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:46,363
Please.

313
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,701
No.

314
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,788
My father was Master of Birds.

315
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,331
He sang to eagles.

316
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,502
But I am not him.

317
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:03,463
Shame.

318
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,968
I would have enjoyed a song.

319
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,533
Strange weapons.

320
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:33,911
Broken.

321
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,319
Raka.

322
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:12,991
Noa.

323
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:22,292
She follows
because she is hungry.

324
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,552
No, no, no.

325
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:36,223
This is...

326
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:39,643
important.

327
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:43,313
They get cold.

328
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:48,068
Show mercy.

329
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,467
She is smarter than most.

330
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:21,351
We will name her Nova.

331
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,357
We name them all Nova.

332
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:31,319
I do not know why.
It is from Caesar's time.

333
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:36,700
Why did Caesar care so much
for Echoes?

334
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:41,413
Legend says
he was reared by them...

335
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:45,417
impossible as that may seem.

336
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,129
Caesar legend is important.

337
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:53,550
He was first Elder.

338
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:57,971
He led with decency...

339
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:00,682
morality...

340
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:03,810
strength...

341
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,273
compassion.

342
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:16,323
Caesar never had
to share camp...

343
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,743
with this Nova.

344
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,924
The smell is potent.

345
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:32,686
A tunnel that eats light?

346
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,814
She saw what I saw.

347
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:38,608
It was in her eyes.

348
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:39,859
She...

349
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:42,195
reacted.

350
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,364
How?

351
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:49,661
As ape would.

352
00:54:57,419 --> 00:55:00,005
-If Echo comes, she must ride.
-Hmm.

353
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:04,050
Is my young companion
showing compassion
for our fellow traveler?

354
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:06,261
She is slow.

355
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:25,780
Horse.

356
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:38,293
Then, of course,
there is the gibbon.

357
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:41,171
Very, very long arms.

358
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:48,303
Is most unfortunate
that the human can only use
its feet for walking.

359
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,930
Imagine if you were falling
from a tree.

360
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:53,641
You only have two appendages
to save your life.

361
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:57,103
But if you were able to use
both of your hands...

362
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:59,189
and both of your feet...

363
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,691
that's four times the safety.

364
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:06,613
And I imagine that,
if I came across a special...

365
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:11,034
What is that?

366
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,896
Horses with stripes.

367
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:44,192
Quite striking.

368
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:36,786
We feared the herds
ceased to exist.

369
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,729
Will you not say goodbye?

370
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:08,193
I must find my clan.

371
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:12,614
The Nova stays with her kind.

372
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:15,450
You raise them up.

373
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:20,705
Follow Caesar's word.

374
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:32,133
To remember...

375
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,303
who he was.

376
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,184
It is important.

377
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,799
They are like you.

378
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,469
Would you like to join them?

379
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,990
He has his journey.

380
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:39,951
We have ours.

381
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:41,619
Come.

382
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,002
Nova!

383
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:33,296
Nova!

384
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:01,115
Take them!

385
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:08,831
Ride them down!

386
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:10,750
Catch that one!

387
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:54,794
This one? Hyah!

388
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:02,677
There!

389
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,075
Spread out.

390
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:27,118
Lightning.

391
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:40,965
This way.

392
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:42,925
Find her!

393
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:53,936
I know she here!

394
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:59,066
Raka!

395
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:02,069
Nova!

396
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:05,281
Come out!

397
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:07,033
I smell you!

398
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:10,536
Raka!

399
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,044
Noa!

400
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:43,820
Hyah!

401
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:10,263
Noa!

402
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:19,689
Raka!

403
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:23,150
Caesar will forgive.

404
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:25,611
Shall we continue?

405
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:49,302
This should give us time.

406
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:29,675
What did I miss?

407
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:31,177
She spoke.

408
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:36,515
She called my name.

409
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:39,018
You misheard.

410
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:43,814
You said this Nova
was smarter than most.

411
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:45,316
Within reason.

412
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:48,861
Some intelligence,
to be sure, but...

413
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:50,446
I have a name.

414
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:53,366
Mae.

415
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:59,997
I know where
they're taking your clan.

416
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:10,967
It's a human settlement.

417
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:14,845
It's where I'm headed to.

418
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:16,681
Looking for more like me.

419
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:18,182
There are more...

420
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,184
like you?

421
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,438
There used to be more.

422
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:28,442
You hid the truth?

423
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:30,695
My mother taught me silence...

424
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:33,823
for my safety.

425
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:38,119
You were safe with us.

426
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,871
And still not true.

427
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:44,583
Where is your mother now?

428
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:49,839
I am alone.

429
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:53,050
Huh.

430
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:56,387
As are we all.

431
01:06:57,596 --> 01:06:58,848
But now...

432
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:02,810
we have each other.

433
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:14,947
Ah.

434
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:19,035
Let us have a fire.

435
01:07:19,076 --> 01:07:21,495
We have much to discuss.

436
01:10:48,702 --> 01:10:49,995
Go back.

437
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:51,997
Go back!

438
01:10:58,462 --> 01:10:59,463
Noa!

439
01:11:02,883 --> 01:11:04,093
Mae!

440
01:11:09,556 --> 01:11:10,683
Mae!

441
01:11:10,724 --> 01:11:11,767
No!

442
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:27,825
Mae!

443
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:33,372
Hold on!

444
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:35,666
Mae!

445
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:52,474
No! Raka!

446
01:11:52,516 --> 01:11:53,517
Raka!

447
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:08,907
Together...

448
01:12:10,075 --> 01:12:11,243
strong.

449
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:11,113
Stand back! Human!

450
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:35,053
No! No! No!

451
01:14:49,234 --> 01:14:51,904
Welcome home, baby bird.

452
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:03,457
Go!

453
01:15:56,593 --> 01:15:58,470
Noa?

454
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:01,265
Noa!

455
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:04,268
I missed you.
Soona. Soona.

456
01:16:07,604 --> 01:16:08,605
No.

457
01:16:11,483 --> 01:16:13,443
You were dead.

458
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:17,197
I... I saw you fall.

459
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:19,866
You are not hurt?

460
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:22,077
No.

461
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:23,829
No.

462
01:16:29,334 --> 01:16:31,086
Mother?

463
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:32,129
Anaya?

464
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:24,848
Vonnegut.

465
01:17:25,932 --> 01:17:27,392
That's a good one.

466
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:30,687
Not a lot of fiction there.

467
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:33,857
He's mostly interested
in history.

468
01:17:35,734 --> 01:17:38,695
Roman history, especially.

469
01:17:43,283 --> 01:17:44,910
The name's Trevathan.

470
01:17:48,413 --> 01:17:50,248
Where, uh...

471
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:51,625
Where are you from?

472
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:55,921
You first.

473
01:17:57,923 --> 01:18:01,802
Well, doesn't really matter,
does it?

474
01:18:01,843 --> 01:18:03,053
I left.

475
01:18:04,596 --> 01:18:06,264
Same as you.

476
01:18:06,306 --> 01:18:09,017
Made it almost to the coast

477
01:18:09,059 --> 01:18:12,229
and then I fell
and shattered my ankles.

478
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:14,147
That's where
Proximus found me.

479
01:18:15,982 --> 01:18:20,404
And now you read him
Roman history.

480
01:18:23,448 --> 01:18:25,534
So, who are you?

481
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:29,913
I'm the human
not helping the apes.

482
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:47,556
Noa.

483
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:51,893
Share. Must share.

484
01:18:51,935 --> 01:18:52,936
Good.

485
01:18:56,982 --> 01:18:58,358
Noa?

486
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,693
- Noa!
- You're alive!

487
01:19:17,335 --> 01:19:18,587
Father...

488
01:19:19,379 --> 01:19:20,547
he's...

489
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:22,883
I know.

490
01:19:40,192 --> 01:19:42,027
We must go.

491
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:44,863
Come.

492
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:56,249
Caesar!

493
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:09,054
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

494
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:56,601
What a wonderful day!

495
01:20:56,643 --> 01:20:59,604
What a wonderful day!

496
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:03,608
Are we thankful
for the words of Caesar?

497
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:05,652
We are thankful.

498
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:07,904
Do we bend our heads?

499
01:21:07,946 --> 01:21:09,823
We bend!

500
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:12,284
Say his words!

501
01:21:12,325 --> 01:21:14,494
Apes together strong!

502
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:16,329
Say his words!

503
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:18,832
Apes together strong!

504
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:21,626
What a wonderful day!

505
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:33,138
That felt good.

506
01:21:33,179 --> 01:21:36,182
When I think on those words...

507
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:39,144
I feel good.

508
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:44,900
Caesar was first Elder.

509
01:21:44,941 --> 01:21:48,987
Now I am Caesar.

510
01:21:52,115 --> 01:21:54,200
He is not Caesar.

511
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:08,214
Now, when I think
of all the treasures
left inside for us...

512
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:10,008
Oh...

513
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:13,011
I feel very good.

514
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:18,016
It may be difficult to open.

515
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:20,727
But not impossible...

516
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:23,647
because we work together.

517
01:22:24,689 --> 01:22:27,192
All as one.

518
01:22:27,233 --> 01:22:29,277
As Caesar wanted.

519
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:32,405
As Caesar required.

520
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:35,116
Apes together strong!

521
01:22:35,992 --> 01:22:37,035
Pull!

522
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:49,506
Pull!

523
01:22:50,548 --> 01:22:52,509
Pull! More!

524
01:22:58,765 --> 01:22:59,891
Watch this.

525
01:23:13,029 --> 01:23:14,823
- Pull!
- Pull!

526
01:23:14,864 --> 01:23:16,908
Pull!

527
01:23:21,871 --> 01:23:23,289
Yes!

528
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:25,083
Yes!

529
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:32,507
More!

530
01:23:43,893 --> 01:23:45,311
Enough!

531
01:23:50,734 --> 01:23:54,738
Maybe stronger tomorrow.

532
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:15,842
Don't worry.

533
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:18,219
Whoever's in there
is either dead or gone.

534
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:22,807
We've been bangin'
on that door for months.

535
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:28,229
Do you not know
where we are?

536
01:24:28,271 --> 01:24:31,691
When things got bad
and the government
went underground,

537
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:33,735
this is where half of it went.

538
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:36,946
With all their technology,
and all their weapons...

539
01:24:39,365 --> 01:24:41,576
Don't you understand?

540
01:24:41,618 --> 01:24:43,995
That ape cannot have
what is inside the...

541
01:24:44,037 --> 01:24:47,290
You gotta stop thinking
about the way things were

542
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:49,626
and start thinking
about the way they are.

543
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:51,836
This is a good life,

544
01:24:51,878 --> 01:24:54,798
and you have a chance
to be a part of it.

545
01:24:54,839 --> 01:24:57,342
What, and build a world
for the apes?

546
01:24:57,383 --> 01:25:00,178
It is already their world.

547
01:25:08,311 --> 01:25:11,231
There's hot water
and fresh clothes
in that room back there.

548
01:25:12,816 --> 01:25:15,568
You'll feel better
when you get yourself
cleaned up.

549
01:25:17,153 --> 01:25:19,614
You better figure out
how to be useful around here.

550
01:25:26,579 --> 01:25:27,831
Honored Elder...

551
01:25:28,915 --> 01:25:29,916
had to bend.

552
01:25:31,876 --> 01:25:34,087
We had no choice.

553
01:25:35,922 --> 01:25:37,465
You must accept.

554
01:25:40,802 --> 01:25:41,970
It is law.

555
01:25:44,222 --> 01:25:49,352
The Elders
did not tell us everything

556
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:52,272
about this world.

557
01:25:52,313 --> 01:25:55,984
They did not tell us
because they did not know.

558
01:25:57,277 --> 01:26:00,405
They did not want to know.

559
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:09,247
You are different.

560
01:26:12,375 --> 01:26:13,543
Come.

561
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:31,102
And that's why
they call it a toga party.

562
01:26:34,314 --> 01:26:38,359
You are a funny
little human, Trevathan.

563
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:44,908
Hey, come.

564
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:46,576
Come, sit.

565
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:50,079
Please.

566
01:26:51,956 --> 01:26:52,957
Go.

567
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:54,667
Go.

568
01:27:05,386 --> 01:27:07,722
Wonderful day, yes?

569
01:27:11,392 --> 01:27:14,312
You two have come a long way.

570
01:27:16,272 --> 01:27:18,691
An ape and a human

571
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:20,360
traveling together is...

572
01:27:21,986 --> 01:27:23,988
quite an adventure.

573
01:27:26,157 --> 01:27:27,617
You are Noa, yes?

574
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:30,453
Welcome, Noa.

575
01:27:45,468 --> 01:27:46,469
Go.

576
01:27:54,018 --> 01:27:55,603
Mae...

577
01:27:55,645 --> 01:27:59,232
you are familiar
with the concept of...

578
01:27:59,857 --> 01:28:01,776
evolution?

579
01:28:01,818 --> 01:28:04,487
That is the human label, yeah?

580
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:09,117
The advancement
that I crave requires time.

581
01:28:09,158 --> 01:28:13,037
Vast amounts of time
that I do not have.

582
01:28:14,372 --> 01:28:17,625
Unfortunately, I am
but a mortal ape.

583
01:28:19,836 --> 01:28:24,966
So this is why I need
to get the knowledge
inside that vault.

584
01:28:25,008 --> 01:28:26,426
I believe it will deliver

585
01:28:26,467 --> 01:28:29,721
instant evolution.

586
01:28:30,722 --> 01:28:32,890
Hmm. Noa.

587
01:28:33,933 --> 01:28:35,268
You don't understand.

588
01:28:36,686 --> 01:28:38,187
In their time,

589
01:28:38,229 --> 01:28:43,985
humans were capable
of many great things, yes?

590
01:28:44,027 --> 01:28:46,279
They could level mountains.

591
01:28:48,072 --> 01:28:50,616
They could speak
across oceans.

592
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:53,244
They could fly, Noa.

593
01:28:53,786 --> 01:28:55,747
Like eagles fly.

594
01:28:55,788 --> 01:28:59,000
But now, we will learn.

595
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:02,670
Apes will learn.
I will learn, yeah,

596
01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:06,007
from what is inside
that vault.

597
01:29:06,049 --> 01:29:08,176
It's impossible.

598
01:29:09,844 --> 01:29:11,637
No one's getting in there.

599
01:29:16,934 --> 01:29:19,145
Mae, Mae, Mae, Mae.

600
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:26,611
My apes encountered
your companions.

601
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:31,157
I believe this map
belonged to you.

602
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:33,785
You see, Noa,

603
01:29:33,826 --> 01:29:36,371
before she was traveling
with you

604
01:29:36,412 --> 01:29:40,625
and that old orangutan,

605
01:29:40,666 --> 01:29:43,961
Mae was with other humans.

606
01:29:46,923 --> 01:29:48,216
But sadly,

607
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:53,679
my apes did not realize
their value,

608
01:29:53,721 --> 01:29:58,184
so I was brought only bodies.

609
01:29:58,226 --> 01:30:02,605
I could not speak to them
like I can speak to you.

610
01:30:04,524 --> 01:30:06,609
I know...

611
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:10,154
you are coming here
to get inside my vault.

612
01:30:10,196 --> 01:30:11,864
It is not yours!

613
01:30:11,906 --> 01:30:13,574
Oh.

614
01:30:13,616 --> 01:30:16,035
It is now, isn't it?

615
01:30:17,036 --> 01:30:20,248
And I will get inside.

616
01:30:20,289 --> 01:30:24,585
No matter how many apes
it costs me.

617
01:30:25,461 --> 01:30:26,462
Noa.

618
01:30:26,921 --> 01:30:28,673
I...

619
01:30:28,714 --> 01:30:33,719
I have heard that you are
a very clever ape, yeah?

620
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:35,972
Very clever.

621
01:30:36,013 --> 01:30:39,892
He repaired one of your
broken staffs, Trevathan.

622
01:30:42,812 --> 01:30:46,649
I have much use
for clever apes.

623
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:49,235
Now, can you tell me...

624
01:30:51,070 --> 01:30:55,116
did Mae tell you
how to get inside my vault?

625
01:31:00,496 --> 01:31:01,914
She told me nothing.

626
01:31:02,832 --> 01:31:04,625
Told you nothing!

627
01:31:04,667 --> 01:31:05,668
Nothing.

628
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:11,340
Told you nothing.

629
01:31:15,553 --> 01:31:16,596
Noa.

630
01:31:17,597 --> 01:31:19,724
Come. Come with me.

631
01:31:19,765 --> 01:31:20,933
Come, come.

632
01:31:22,435 --> 01:31:24,020
I have something to show you.

633
01:31:25,021 --> 01:31:26,981
Come. Come.

634
01:31:28,816 --> 01:31:29,942
Come, Noa.

635
01:31:31,611 --> 01:31:33,696
Tell me, what do you see?

636
01:31:43,247 --> 01:31:45,458
Stolen clans.

637
01:31:48,085 --> 01:31:49,504
Not clans.

638
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:52,465
A kingdom.

639
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:57,762
Noa, a kingdom for apes.

640
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:06,395
Humans can never be trusted.

641
01:32:06,437 --> 01:32:09,565
Where there are two
that can speak,

642
01:32:09,607 --> 01:32:11,067
there must be more.

643
01:32:13,236 --> 01:32:19,075
Mae has come here to claim
the tools inside my vault.

644
01:32:19,116 --> 01:32:22,411
Tools that make humans strong

645
01:32:22,453 --> 01:32:24,539
and make them dangerous.

646
01:32:27,083 --> 01:32:29,377
That is why
I must have them first.

647
01:32:29,418 --> 01:32:30,753
Yeah?

648
01:32:30,795 --> 01:32:36,342
They do not understand
that this is our time.

649
01:32:36,384 --> 01:32:38,511
This is my kingdom.

650
01:32:41,847 --> 01:32:44,892
I must destroy their kind.

651
01:32:46,018 --> 01:32:49,438
Unless we want to live
in cages again.

652
01:32:56,404 --> 01:32:57,780
Come.

653
01:32:57,822 --> 01:32:59,448
Come, Noa.

654
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:00,825
Let us eat.

655
01:33:02,827 --> 01:33:03,869
Trevathan!

656
01:33:04,412 --> 01:33:06,372
Tell us a story.

657
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:08,124
Make it a funny one.

658
01:33:31,105 --> 01:33:32,982
They will not come.

659
01:33:36,777 --> 01:33:37,778
Why?

660
01:33:39,697 --> 01:33:42,116
Because Eagle Clan...

661
01:33:44,035 --> 01:33:45,119
is gone.

662
01:33:48,414 --> 01:33:53,502
Eagle Clan is here.

663
01:33:54,503 --> 01:33:57,048
We are here.

664
01:33:59,550 --> 01:34:01,510
In land of Proximus.

665
01:34:03,262 --> 01:34:08,225
And Proximus has no need
for eagles.

666
01:34:42,635 --> 01:34:46,472
You come to judge me?

667
01:34:51,894 --> 01:34:53,688
I judge myself.

668
01:34:55,481 --> 01:34:59,402
I promised our father

669
01:34:59,443 --> 01:35:01,028
I would bring them home.

670
01:35:05,449 --> 01:35:06,701
I failed.

671
01:35:08,953 --> 01:35:11,539
Eagle Clan belongs

672
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:15,626
to Proximus Caesar now.

673
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:21,882
That is the law.

674
01:35:37,273 --> 01:35:41,986
But the law is wrong.

675
01:36:29,784 --> 01:36:32,620
Time for
the evening lesson.

676
01:36:32,661 --> 01:36:35,581
It would be very good for you
to be there.

677
01:37:14,578 --> 01:37:17,248
You did not come
for Echoes.

678
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:21,836
And you were not alone.

679
01:37:23,128 --> 01:37:24,213
I'm sorry.

680
01:37:26,799 --> 01:37:29,218
Proximus's apes
found our camp.

681
01:37:31,887 --> 01:37:33,430
They killed everyone.

682
01:37:34,807 --> 01:37:36,767
I barely escaped.

683
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:40,187
I needed your help.

684
01:37:40,229 --> 01:37:43,190
-And I was afraid.
-The more you speak,

685
01:37:43,232 --> 01:37:45,359
the less I believe.

686
01:37:45,401 --> 01:37:47,444
I was wrong not to trust you.

687
01:37:47,486 --> 01:37:48,612
And I know that now.

688
01:37:48,654 --> 01:37:51,782
I trust you
only to help yourself.

689
01:37:54,159 --> 01:37:56,620
But that could help me now.

690
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:02,418
I have questions.

691
01:38:03,794 --> 01:38:05,337
You answer true,

692
01:38:06,171 --> 01:38:07,548
maybe I help.

693
01:38:10,676 --> 01:38:13,095
What do you need inside vault?

694
01:38:15,514 --> 01:38:16,515
It's...

695
01:38:17,433 --> 01:38:18,642
like a book.

696
01:38:19,768 --> 01:38:21,186
-A special book.
-How?

697
01:38:22,521 --> 01:38:23,522
Special?

698
01:38:25,024 --> 01:38:27,902
Humans lost their ability
to speak.

699
01:38:27,943 --> 01:38:29,695
And this book
might bring it back.

700
01:38:31,363 --> 01:38:33,157
A book can do this?

701
01:38:33,991 --> 01:38:35,242
This one can.

702
01:38:42,666 --> 01:38:47,254
Raka said apes and humans

703
01:38:48,589 --> 01:38:50,215
lived side by side.

704
01:38:52,843 --> 01:38:54,178
True or not true?

705
01:38:57,306 --> 01:38:58,474
Apes were silent.

706
01:39:00,225 --> 01:39:01,435
Like the Echo.

707
01:39:03,103 --> 01:39:04,647
Humans were dominant.

708
01:39:06,148 --> 01:39:07,524
The virus spread...

709
01:39:08,776 --> 01:39:10,235
that we created.

710
01:39:11,278 --> 01:39:12,905
It made apes smarter.

711
01:39:14,281 --> 01:39:16,283
And it almost killed
all of us.

712
01:39:23,165 --> 01:39:25,876
You know a way inside, yes?

713
01:39:27,544 --> 01:39:28,545
Yes.

714
01:39:30,130 --> 01:39:31,924
One last question.

715
01:39:35,094 --> 01:39:39,348
Will water destroy
what is inside?

716
01:39:59,785 --> 01:40:00,786
Noa.

717
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:15,968
A climb.

718
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:19,638
One I cannot do alone.

719
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:20,681
Why?

720
01:40:22,016 --> 01:40:24,768
To free our clan.

721
01:41:24,953 --> 01:41:27,247
Soona, this is Mae.

722
01:41:29,666 --> 01:41:30,793
Hello, Soona.

723
01:41:35,297 --> 01:41:36,632
What do we do?

724
01:41:38,717 --> 01:41:40,219
We're gonna need all of this.

725
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:42,387
Follow me.

726
01:41:56,068 --> 01:41:57,236
Careful.

727
01:42:00,197 --> 01:42:04,076
The power runs through, yes?

728
01:42:06,411 --> 01:42:07,412
Yes.

729
01:42:23,846 --> 01:42:27,432
You cannot make hard climb...

730
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:31,812
without Anaya.

731
01:42:45,826 --> 01:42:46,994
Hello, Echo.

732
01:43:04,261 --> 01:43:05,846
This burns hot.

733
01:43:05,888 --> 01:43:07,389
But under pressure,

734
01:43:08,807 --> 01:43:10,851
it will explode.

735
01:43:12,269 --> 01:43:14,479
How do you know this?

736
01:43:20,652 --> 01:43:21,862
Oh, shit.

737
01:43:27,117 --> 01:43:28,118
"Shit"?

738
01:43:29,411 --> 01:43:31,663
- Take that over there.
- Okay.

739
01:43:31,705 --> 01:43:33,624
I go with Anaya.

740
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:35,792
Safer that way.

741
01:43:37,169 --> 01:43:40,714
Anaya! Anaya. Stop.

742
01:43:40,756 --> 01:43:43,091
- You're doing it wrong.
- Okay.

743
01:43:43,133 --> 01:43:44,259
You like her.

744
01:43:46,762 --> 01:43:47,763
Soona.

745
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:51,808
We were born within a sunset.

746
01:43:55,479 --> 01:43:56,772
No. Anaya...

747
01:43:56,813 --> 01:43:58,607
He's just
going to rebuild it.

748
01:44:10,285 --> 01:44:11,286
You...

749
01:44:13,956 --> 01:44:16,083
You had an opportunity.

750
01:44:16,124 --> 01:44:18,961
I gave you an opportunity.

751
01:44:19,002 --> 01:44:23,632
But you're fantasizing
about a past
that can never come back.

752
01:44:30,180 --> 01:44:31,556
Listen to me.

753
01:44:33,016 --> 01:44:37,396
Trevathan,
you don't belong here.

754
01:44:38,897 --> 01:44:41,191
You think it's over,

755
01:44:41,233 --> 01:44:42,484
but it's not.

756
01:44:43,902 --> 01:44:47,906
Nobody is going to blame you
for what happened here.

757
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:52,786
Just come with us.

758
01:44:55,580 --> 01:44:56,581
Please?

759
01:45:04,214 --> 01:45:06,633
He's gonna skin
your monkey alive.

760
01:45:11,179 --> 01:45:12,180
And you...

761
01:45:13,348 --> 01:45:14,349
Well...

762
01:45:16,435 --> 01:45:18,270
you're gonna learn.

763
01:45:26,194 --> 01:45:27,362
Oh, no.

764
01:45:27,404 --> 01:45:28,530
Please!

765
01:46:29,508 --> 01:46:30,967
We need to go.

766
01:46:31,009 --> 01:46:32,260
It'll be light soon.

767
01:46:52,531 --> 01:46:55,075
You said
there would be climb!

768
01:47:09,423 --> 01:47:10,465
Mae, wait!

769
01:47:17,973 --> 01:47:19,307
Mae!

770
01:47:23,437 --> 01:47:24,396
There!

771
01:47:25,355 --> 01:47:27,190
We need to go up there.

772
01:47:29,067 --> 01:47:30,819
Now we climb?

773
01:47:52,048 --> 01:47:54,176
Easier
than Top Nest.

774
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:56,178
Keep climbing.

775
01:48:19,868 --> 01:48:20,869
Noa!

776
01:48:33,882 --> 01:48:34,883
Shit?

777
01:48:36,134 --> 01:48:37,135
Mm-hmm.

778
01:49:40,782 --> 01:49:41,950
Wait. Careful.

779
01:49:47,163 --> 01:49:48,164
Oops.

780
01:49:48,957 --> 01:49:50,083
Anaya!

781
01:50:19,362 --> 01:50:23,074
Noa,
what is this place?

782
01:50:25,619 --> 01:50:26,703
It smells.

783
01:50:36,129 --> 01:50:37,464
What is that? Noa!

784
01:50:38,465 --> 01:50:39,966
Noa! What happening?

785
01:51:15,251 --> 01:51:17,295
Echo build all this?

786
01:51:41,236 --> 01:51:42,278
Wait here.

787
01:52:35,373 --> 01:52:36,541
Mama!

788
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:53,451
The symbols
have meaning.

789
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:48,298
Time to go.

790
01:55:12,989 --> 01:55:16,367
Whoa. What are they?

791
01:55:17,660 --> 01:55:18,661
Come!

792
01:55:57,617 --> 01:55:59,077
We'll have to move fast.

793
01:55:59,744 --> 01:56:01,371
You go to your clan

794
01:56:01,412 --> 01:56:02,956
and I'll trigger
the explosion.

795
01:56:58,219 --> 01:57:03,349
Noa, you are
a very useful ape.

796
01:57:04,642 --> 01:57:08,730
You understand so many things.

797
01:57:08,771 --> 01:57:11,482
And yet, you fail to observe

798
01:57:11,524 --> 01:57:14,694
one of the most important.

799
01:57:16,487 --> 01:57:19,407
You cannot trust a human!

800
01:57:21,034 --> 01:57:24,746
Here comes your clan
to bear witness.

801
01:57:27,999 --> 01:57:30,418
You may be fool enough

802
01:57:30,460 --> 01:57:34,672
to put your faith
in such
a duplicitous creature.

803
01:57:37,258 --> 01:57:38,426
But I am not.

804
01:57:46,559 --> 01:57:47,769
Tell me, Noa,

805
01:57:48,561 --> 01:57:50,438
ape to ape,

806
01:57:52,231 --> 01:57:56,861
what did Mae
have planned for me
inside my own vault?

807
01:57:59,530 --> 01:58:00,990
Okay.

808
01:58:01,032 --> 01:58:04,243
So what do you choose?

809
01:58:04,285 --> 01:58:07,413
A human over an ape?

810
01:58:08,456 --> 01:58:11,959
Your sweet little Soona...

811
01:58:13,711 --> 01:58:16,172
...or that stinky human?

812
01:58:17,298 --> 01:58:18,508
Tell me your plan!

813
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:21,928
No!

814
01:58:58,631 --> 01:58:59,966
I see.

815
01:59:02,093 --> 01:59:04,637
You can leave, Mae.

816
01:59:06,180 --> 01:59:07,682
You can go.

817
01:59:07,723 --> 01:59:10,935
You're free. Just tell me...

818
01:59:10,977 --> 01:59:15,648
are there more of those
in there?

819
01:59:22,113 --> 01:59:23,239
Mae?

820
01:59:24,490 --> 01:59:25,533
Mae.

821
01:59:27,201 --> 01:59:28,286
No.

822
01:59:29,787 --> 01:59:31,664
We cannot.

823
01:59:32,999 --> 01:59:34,125
He can't have it.

824
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:35,751
Mae.

825
01:59:37,461 --> 01:59:38,754
-I'm sorry.
-Mae!

826
01:59:40,047 --> 01:59:41,716
No!

827
01:59:41,757 --> 01:59:43,968
Mae, no!

828
01:59:46,179 --> 01:59:47,388
Mae!

829
02:00:11,787 --> 02:00:13,206
What have you done?

830
02:00:19,962 --> 02:00:21,380
Climb.

831
02:00:21,422 --> 02:00:22,423
Climb!

832
02:00:23,382 --> 02:00:24,675
-Climb!
-No.

833
02:00:30,264 --> 02:00:31,265
No!

834
02:01:14,892 --> 02:01:16,727
Noa! Noa!

835
02:01:16,769 --> 02:01:19,146
- Soona!
- Behind you!

836
02:01:19,188 --> 02:01:20,982
Climb!

837
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:24,151
Son! Son!

838
02:01:24,193 --> 02:01:25,778
- Mother!
- Son!

839
02:01:25,820 --> 02:01:27,738
Mother! Mother!

840
02:01:27,780 --> 02:01:28,781
Mother!

841
02:01:30,449 --> 02:01:31,575
Dar!

842
02:01:31,617 --> 02:01:33,369
Grab her!

843
02:01:33,411 --> 02:01:35,663
Dar! Grab my hand!

844
02:01:35,705 --> 02:01:38,582
- Mother!
- Dar!

845
02:01:41,836 --> 02:01:42,837
Dar!

846
02:01:46,507 --> 02:01:47,842
Dar, got you.

847
02:01:48,968 --> 02:01:50,594
Noa, what we do?

848
02:01:52,596 --> 02:01:54,473
This way! Go!

849
02:02:02,023 --> 02:02:05,234
Eagle Clan! Climb!

850
02:02:05,276 --> 02:02:07,653
Follow Soona! Follow Anaya!

851
02:02:07,695 --> 02:02:10,239
- This way! Climb!
- Go. Go.

852
02:02:10,281 --> 02:02:11,282
Climb!

853
02:02:19,373 --> 02:02:20,458
This way!

854
02:02:22,209 --> 02:02:23,336
Hurry!

855
02:02:25,046 --> 02:02:26,505
Follow Soona!

856
02:02:26,547 --> 02:02:28,466
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Go!

857
02:02:33,220 --> 02:02:35,389
- Come.
- Go!

858
02:02:35,431 --> 02:02:36,640
Climb, Soona!

859
02:02:36,682 --> 02:02:38,225
This the way out!

860
02:02:38,726 --> 02:02:40,227
Hurry!

861
02:02:40,269 --> 02:02:41,395
-Climb!
-Noa!

862
02:02:41,437 --> 02:02:42,646
Mother, go!

863
02:02:42,688 --> 02:02:44,315
- Noa!
- Climb, Anaya!

864
02:02:44,357 --> 02:02:45,775
-Soona, go!
-Lead them!

865
02:02:45,816 --> 02:02:47,401
Go! Climb!

866
02:02:47,443 --> 02:02:50,112
Go! Go, hurry!

867
02:05:34,693 --> 02:05:37,821
You think you can
destroy my kingdom?

868
02:05:47,748 --> 02:05:51,335
You think you can
destroy what I am?

869
02:05:57,174 --> 02:05:58,217
- Noa!
- Leave him.

870
02:06:11,689 --> 02:06:13,107
Noa.

871
02:06:14,775 --> 02:06:18,696
You showed so much promise.

872
02:06:20,447 --> 02:06:23,826
You are going to stand,

873
02:06:23,867 --> 02:06:27,121
so that you can bend
for your king...

874
02:06:27,913 --> 02:06:29,164
before you die.

875
02:06:34,295 --> 02:06:38,424
And you will all bear witness

876
02:06:38,465 --> 02:06:44,430
as Noa bends before his king.

877
02:06:47,641 --> 02:06:49,018
Now stand.

878
02:06:49,977 --> 02:06:51,604
Stand now!

879
02:06:54,607 --> 02:06:55,649
That's it.

880
02:06:56,233 --> 02:06:57,901
Clever ape.

881
02:07:21,842 --> 02:07:23,385
What is this?

882
02:07:26,680 --> 02:07:28,557
Trevathan would love this.

883
02:07:58,962 --> 02:07:59,963
Enough!

884
02:08:02,424 --> 02:08:03,467
Enough!

885
02:09:13,328 --> 02:09:17,291
Let us go home.

886
02:09:47,946 --> 02:09:49,198
He's coming!

887
02:09:52,576 --> 02:09:53,744
Soft?

888
02:09:54,453 --> 02:09:56,330
Too firm.

889
02:09:57,164 --> 02:09:58,165
Too firm.

890
02:09:59,917 --> 02:10:01,376
-Silk.
-Good.

891
02:10:08,008 --> 02:10:09,009
Noa.

892
02:10:30,656 --> 02:10:32,282
I came to say goodbye.

893
02:10:41,542 --> 02:10:43,544
Proximus was right.

894
02:10:44,670 --> 02:10:48,465
Humans will never give up.

895
02:10:49,716 --> 02:10:53,762
Not until you claim all things

896
02:10:53,804 --> 02:10:55,347
for yourselves.

897
02:10:56,431 --> 02:10:57,808
It was ours.

898
02:10:58,642 --> 02:11:01,228
That silo was a human place

899
02:11:01,270 --> 02:11:03,146
with human things
and human ideas.

900
02:11:03,188 --> 02:11:04,815
It was not meant for apes.

901
02:11:04,857 --> 02:11:07,484
What is for apes?

902
02:11:09,570 --> 02:11:11,697
Should we go back to silence?

903
02:11:13,699 --> 02:11:16,243
We will rebuild our home.

904
02:11:17,995 --> 02:11:19,162
Better.

905
02:11:19,663 --> 02:11:20,873
Stronger.

906
02:11:21,832 --> 02:11:24,126
From what we have learned.

907
02:11:34,386 --> 02:11:36,638
If Raka were here,

908
02:11:38,098 --> 02:11:40,559
he would tell us his Caesar

909
02:11:41,476 --> 02:11:43,979
had much to say on this.

910
02:11:48,275 --> 02:11:50,611
Was he right?

911
02:11:57,034 --> 02:12:02,789
Can ape and human
live together?

912
02:12:13,800 --> 02:12:15,135
I don't know.

913
02:12:29,316 --> 02:12:31,360
Important.

914
02:14:39,404 --> 02:14:40,405
Come.

915
02:14:46,119 --> 02:14:47,996
Rescaling
back down to 20.

916
02:14:48,038 --> 02:14:50,415
New latitude point, 2.722.

917
02:14:50,457 --> 02:14:51,958
Copy that. Spooling up.

918
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:52,793
Let me know
what that distribution
looks like.

919
02:14:52,834 --> 02:14:53,960
Let's get over here.

920
02:14:54,002 --> 02:14:55,337
Readings
have been confirmed.

921
02:14:55,378 --> 02:14:57,047
- Link is ready!
- Pulling up now.

922
02:15:42,217 --> 02:15:43,635
Hello.

923
02:15:44,427 --> 02:15:45,929
Is anyone there?

924
02:15:45,971 --> 02:15:47,305
Come on.

925
02:15:47,347 --> 02:15:48,640
Do you hear me?

926
02:15:51,476 --> 02:15:53,019
Yes, hello?

927
02:15:53,061 --> 02:15:55,272
This is Fort Wayne, Indiana.
We read you!

928
02:15:56,606 --> 02:15:58,775
It's good to hear
another voice out there.

929
02:15:58,817 --> 02:16:00,694
Tell me where you are.
What's your location?
