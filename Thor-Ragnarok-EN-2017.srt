1
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,346
Now, I know what you're thinking.

2
00:00:57,516 --> 00:01:00,884
"Oh, no! Thor's in a cage. How did this happen?"

3
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,802
Well, sometimes you have to get captured

4
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:04,554
just to get a straight answer out of somebody.

5
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,147
It's a long story,

6
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:09,191
but basically, I'm a bit of a hero.

7
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,941
See, I spent some time on Earth...

8
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,568
fought some robots,

9
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,274
saved the planet a couple of times.

10
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,318
Then I went searching through the cosmos

11
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:21,450
for some magic, colorful Infinity Stone things.

12
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,748
Didn't find any.

13
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,125
That's when I came across

14
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,954
a path of death and destruction...

15
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,832
which led me all the way here into this cage...

16
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,800
where I met you.

17
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,048
Hmm.

18
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,638
How much longer do you think we'll be here?

19
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,284
Thor, son of Odin.

20
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:04,201
Surtur, son of a bitch.

21
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,281
You're still alive.

22
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,794
I thought my father killed you a half a million years ago.

23
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,579
I cannot die.

24
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,498
Not until I fulfill my destiny...

25
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,917
and lay waste to your home.

26
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,585
It's funny you should mention that.

27
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:20,050
Because I've been having these terrible dreams of late.

28
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,465
Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins.

29
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,850
And you, Surtur,

30
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,426
are at the center of all of them.

31
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:29,439
Then you have seen Ragnarok, the fall of Asgard.

32
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,440
- The great prophecy... - Hang on.

33
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:34,315
Hang on.

34
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,112
I'll be back around shortly.

35
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,241
I really feel like we were connecting there.

36
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,370
Okay, so Ragnarok.

37
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,118
Tell me about that. Walk me through it.

38
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,282
My time has come.

39
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,578
When my crown is reunited with the Eternal Flame...

40
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,418
I shall be restored to my full might.

41
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,833
I will tower over the mountains...

42
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,593
and bury my sword deep in Asgard's...

43
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,304
Oh, hang on. Give it a second.

44
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,760
I swear I'm not even moving.

45
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,386
It's just doing this on its own.

46
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,977
I'm really sorry.

47
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,846
Okay, so let me get this straight.

48
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,642
You're going to put your crown into the Eternal Flame...

49
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,186
and then you'll suddenly grow as big as a house?

50
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,524
A mountain!

51
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,736
The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps locked away on Asgard?

52
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,322
Odin is not on Asgard.

53
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,534
And your absence has left the throne defenseless.

54
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,540
Okay, so where is it? This crown?

55
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,623
This is my crown, the source of my power.

56
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,621
Oh, that's a crown.

57
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,502
I thought it was a big eyebrow.

58
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:37,836
It's a crown.

59
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,502
Anyway, it sounds like all I have to do to stop Ragnarok...

60
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,387
is rip that thing off your head.

61
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:47,266
But Ragnarok has already begun.

62
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:49,223
You cannot stop it.

63
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,031
I am Asgard's doom, and so are you.

64
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,784
All will suffer, all will burn.

65
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,661
Oh, that's intense.

66
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,663
To be honest, seeing you grow really big...

67
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,325
and set fire to a planet would be quite the spectacle.

68
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,161
But it looks like I'm gonna have to choose option B...

69
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,079
where I bust out of these chains...

70
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,998
knock that tiara off your head,

71
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,084
and stash it away in Asgard's vault.

72
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:24,262
You cannot stop Ragnarok.

73
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,512
Why fight it?

74
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:29,350
Because that's what heroes do.

75
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,346
Hmm.

76
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,353
Wait, I'm sorry. I didn't time that right.

77
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,979
Hmm?

78
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,527
And, now!

79
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,698
You have made a grave mistake, Odinson.

80
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,409
I make grave mistakes all the time.

81
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,118
Everything seems to work out.

82
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,223
Huh?

83
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,490
Heimdall, I know it's been a while,

84
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,576
but I could really use a fast exit.

85
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,498
Heimdall?

86
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,372
Heimdall was an idiot.

87
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,507
This job should have made him rich.

88
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:27,919
Now, the job ain't easy...

89
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,883
but it does have its benefits.

90
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,423
The Bifrost gives me access to everything

91
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,429
the Nine Realms has to offer.

92
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,890
I mean it's all mine for the taking.

93
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,556
Behold...

94
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:42,896
my stuff.

95
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,226
Ooh.

96
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,903
I'm particularly fond of these.

97
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,612
I pulled them out of a place on Midgard called Texas.

98
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,823
I even named them. Des and Troy.

99
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,032
You see, when you put them together...

100
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,079
they destroy.

101
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,096
Heimdall, come on.

102
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,454
Stay!

103
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:46,081
Heimdall? I'm running short on options.

104
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,841
Heimdall?

105
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,338
Um ... Skurge?

106
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,097
Is that important?

107
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,894
You girls are in for a treat.

108
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,406
Girls!

109
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,666
Well, well, well. Look who decided to pop in.

110
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,872
Thanks for scaring away my company

111
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,624
and drenching my workplace in brains.

112
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:08,912
Who are you?

113
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,748
Don't you remember? I'm Skurge.

114
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:11,958
We fought together on Vanaheim.

115
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,460
Right. Where is Heimdall?

116
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,634
That traitor. No one knows. He's a fugitive of the throne.

117
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,424
Traitor?

118
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,092
Yeah. Well, you see, Odin charged Heimdall

119
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,176
with negligence of duty...

120
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,266
but he disappeared before the trial.

121
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,554
Hard to catch a guy

122
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,638
who can see everything in the universe.

123
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:27,723
Sure.

124
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,351
Hold on. I'm supposed to announce your arrival.

125
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,134
What the hell is that?

126
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,812
Oh, brother. This is it.

127
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,348
I take my leave.

128
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,226
You fool, you didn't listen!

129
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,518
I'm sorry.

130
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:13,727
Lady Sif, get help!

131
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:14,812
Somebody, help!

132
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,151
Sorry for all I've done.

133
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,070
Shh. It's all right. Hold on.

134
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,653
I'm sorry I tried to rule Earth.

135
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,163
They'd be lucky to have you.

136
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,165
I'm sorry about that thing with the Tesseract.

137
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,118
- I just couldn't help myself. - I know.

138
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,501
I'm a trickster.

139
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,504
So mischievous.

140
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,382
Sorry about that time I turned you into a frog.

141
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:36,963
It was a wonderful joke.

142
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,257
'Twas indeed hilarious.

143
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,513
You are the savior of Asgard.

144
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,845
- Tell my story. - I will.

145
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,051
Build a statue for me.

146
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,935
We will build a big statue for you.

147
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,973
With my helmet on, with the big bendy horns.

148
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,108
I will tell Father what you did here today.

149
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,939
I didn't do it for him.

150
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,777
I didn't do it for him.

151
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,704
No!

152
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:16,131
And so, Loki died of his wounds...

153
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,213
giving his life for ours.

154
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,049
He fought back those disgusting elves...

155
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,009
he brought peace to the realm.

156
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,470
Loki, my boy...

157
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,931
'twas many moons ago I found you

158
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,978
on that frostbitten battlefield.

159
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,228
On that day, I did not yet see in you...

160
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,688
Asgard's savior. No.

161
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:40,357
You were merely a little blue baby icicle...

162
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:44,368
that melted this old fool's heart.

163
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,331
Bravo! Bravo! Well done. Bravo.

164
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,078
Father.

165
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,164
Oh, shit.

166
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,792
Uh, my son, Thor, has returned!

167
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:03,171
Greetings, my boy.

168
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,925
It's an interesting play. What's it called?

169
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,182
The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard.

170
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,180
The people wanted to commemorate him.

171
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,686
Ah, indeed they should.

172
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,146
I like the statue.

173
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,477
A lot better looking than he was when he was alive, though.

174
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,483
A little less weaselly, less greasy, maybe.

175
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,611
Do you know what this is?

176
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,491
The skull of Surtur. That's a formidable weapon!

177
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,196
Do me a favor. Lock this away in a vault...

178
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,111
so it doesn't turn into a giant monster

179
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,571
and destroy the whole planet.

180
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,870
Thank you, dear. Um...

181
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,623
So it's back to Midgard for you, is it?

182
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:35,994
Nope.

183
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,127
I've been having this reoccurring dream lately.

184
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,088
Every night, I see Asgard fall into ruins.

185
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:43,377
That's just a silly dream...

186
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,512
signs of an overactive imagination.

187
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:46,797
Possibly.

188
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,723
But then I decide to go out there and investigate.

189
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,141
And what do I find,

190
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,971
but the Nine Realms completely in chaos.

191
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,107
Enemies of Asgard assembling, plotting our demise...

192
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,812
all while you, Odin,

193
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,188
the protector of those Nine Realms...

194
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,023
are sitting here in your bathrobe,

195
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,104
eating grapes.

196
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,315
Yes, it is best to respect our neighbors' freedom.

197
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,572
Yes, of course, the freedom to be massacred.

198
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,534
Yes, besides I've been rather busy myself.

199
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:12,823
Watching theater.

200
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,749
Board meetings, and security council meetings...

201
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,042
You're really gonna make me do it?

202
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,457
Do what?

203
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,167
You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir

204
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,752
as it returns to my hand.

205
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,386
Not even your face.

206
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,764
You've gone quite mad. You'll be executed for this.

207
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,467
Then I'll see you on the other side, brother.

208
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,262
All right, I yield.

209
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,564
Behold!

210
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,615
Thor...

211
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,743
-Odinson.- No.

212
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,788
You had one job. Just the one.

213
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,950
Where's Odin?

214
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,869
You just couldn't stay away, could you?

215
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,920
Everything was fine without you.

216
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,753
Asgard was prospering. You've ruined everything.

217
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,251
- Ask them. - Where's Father?

218
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,961
- Did you kill him? - You had what you wanted.

219
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,045
You had the independence you asked for.

220
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,255
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

221
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,432
Okay. I know exactly where he is.

222
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,687
I swear I left him right here.

223
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,448
Right here on the sidewalk,

224
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,820
or right there where the building is being demolished?

225
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,151
Great planning.

226
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,573
How was I supposed to know?

227
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,912
Can't see into the future. I'm not a witch.

228
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,286
No? Then why do you dress like one?

229
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,666
- Hey. - I can't believe you're alive.

230
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,293
I saw you die.

231
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,087
I mourned you, I cried for you.

232
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,459
I'm honored.

233
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,831
Ask him.

234
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,500
Hi. Would you mind taking a picture with us?

235
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,878
Oh, sure.

236
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,507
Start figuring out where he is.

237
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:52,510
Oh, my God.

238
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,681
Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you.

239
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,427
She didn't dump me, you know.

240
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,766
I dumped her. It was a mutual dumping.

241
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:02,600
What's this? What are you doing?

242
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:03,934
This isn't me.

243
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:09,648
Loki.

244
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,596
Thor Odinson.

245
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,687
God of Thunder.

246
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,281
You can put down the umbrella.

247
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,092
So, Earth has, uh, wizards now?

248
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,387
The preferred term is

249
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,185
"Master of the Mystic Arts." You can leave that now.

250
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,854
All right, wizard.

251
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,226
Who are you? Why should I care?

252
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,562
My name is Doctor Stephen Strange,

253
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,609
and I have some questions for you.

254
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:29,686
Take a seat.

255
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,817
Tea?

256
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:39,613
I don't drink tea.

257
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,031
What do you drink?

258
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,498
Not tea.

259
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,579
So, I keep a watch list

260
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,456
of individuals and beings from other realms...

261
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,336
that may be a threat to this world.

262
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:55,011
Your adopted brother, Loki, is one of those beings.

263
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,673
He's a worthy inclusion. Hmm.

264
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,096
Then why bring him here?

265
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:02,932
We're looking for my father.

266
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,440
So, if I were to tell you where Odin was...

267
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,105
all parties concerned would promptly return to Asgard?

268
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:10,477
Promptly.

269
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,862
Great! Then I'll help you.

270
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,231
If you knew where he was, why didn't you call me?

271
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,150
I have to tell you, he was adamant

272
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:17,234
that he not be disturbed.

273
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,449
Your father said he had chosen to remain in exile.

274
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,703
- Hmm. - And you don't have a phone.

275
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,784
No, I don't have a phone...

276
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,703
but you could have sent an electronic letter.

277
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:28,878
It's called an email.

278
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,622
- Yeah, do you have a computer? - No. What for?

279
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,874
- Uh-huh. - Anyway,

280
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,551
my father is no longer in exile.

281
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,381
So if you could tell me where he is,

282
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,462
I can take him home.

283
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,506
Gladly. He's in Norway.

284
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,684
I'm just seeing whether this incantation

285
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,763
requires any Asgardian modifications.

286
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,476
Nope.

287
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:49,516
Oh, we don't need that.

288
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,658
Will you stop doing that?

289
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,863
I need just one strand of your hair.

290
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:03,113
Let me explain something.

291
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,704
My hair is not to be meddled with.

292
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:14,712
We could have just walked.

293
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,304
He's waiting for you.

294
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,680
All right.

295
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,216
Don't forget your umbrella.

296
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,638
Oh, yes.

297
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,434
Sorry.

298
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:36,692
There we go.

299
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,692
I suppose I'll need my brother back.

300
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:41,535
Oh, yeah. Right.

301
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:50,077
I have been falling for 30 minutes!

302
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,249
You can handle him from here.

303
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:53,997
Yes. Of course.

304
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,419
Thank you very much for your help.

305
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,666
Good luck.

306
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,718
Handle me? Who are you?

307
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,462
Loki.

308
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:01,884
You think you're some kind of sorcerer?

309
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,677
Don't think for one minute, you second-rate...

310
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:04,966
Bye-bye.

311
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:31,368
Father?

312
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,672
Look at this place. It's beautiful.

313
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,508
Father, it's us.

314
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,426
My sons.

315
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,720
I've been waiting for you.

316
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:51,517
I know. We've come to take you home.

317
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,481
Home, yes.

318
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,440
Your mother, she calls me.

319
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,980
Do you hear it?

320
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,655
Loki, lift your magic.

321
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,823
Took me quite a while to break free from your spell.

322
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,492
Frigga would have been proud.

323
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:14,286
Come and sit with me. I don't have much time.

324
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,669
I know that we failed you.

325
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,129
But we can make this right.

326
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,097
I failed you.

327
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,726
It is upon us. Ragnarok.

328
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:32,684
No, I've stopped Ragnarok. I put an end to Surtur.

329
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,472
No.

330
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,024
It has already begun. She's coming.

331
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:40,403
My life was all that held her back.

332
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,479
But my time has come.

333
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,151
I cannot keep her away any longer.

334
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,115
Father, who are you talking about?

335
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,782
Goddess of Death. Hela.

336
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,371
My firstborn.

337
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,578
Your sister.

338
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,333
Your what?

339
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,637
Her violent appetites grew beyond my control.

340
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,971
I couldn't stop her, so I imprisoned her.

341
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,142
Locked her away.

342
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:16,390
She draws her strength from Asgard...

343
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:21,228
and once she gets there, her powers will be limitless.

344
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:22,983
Whatever she is, we can stop her together.

345
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,063
We can face her together.

346
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:25,315
No, we won't.

347
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,451
I'm on a different path now.

348
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,074
This you must face alone.

349
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,207
I love you, my sons.

350
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,412
Look at that.

351
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,171
Remember this place.

352
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,045
Home.

353
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,048
Brother.

354
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,479
This was your doing.

355
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,273
So he's gone.

356
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,488
That's a shame. I would've liked to have seen that.

357
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,402
You must be Hela.

358
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,318
I'm Thor, son of Odin.

359
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:36,989
Really? You don't look like him.

360
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,157
Perhaps we can come to an arrangement.

361
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,201
You sound like him.

362
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:44,287
Kneel.

363
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:45,796
Beg your pardon?

364
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,631
Kneel.

365
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,724
Before your queen.

366
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,386
I don't think so.

367
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,107
It's not possible.

368
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,824
Darling, you have no idea what's possible.

369
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,132
Bring us back!

370
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,217
No!

371
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:49,394
Loki!

372
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:37,943
Who are you? What have you done with Thor?

373
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,411
I'm Hela.

374
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,290
I'm just a janitor.

375
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,878
You look like a smart boy with good survival instincts.

376
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,633
How would you like a job?

377
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:10,603
Are you a fighter?

378
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,764
Or are you food?

379
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:14,933
I'm just passing through.

380
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,938
It is food.

381
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:18,311
On your knees.

382
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:02,397
He's mine.

383
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:12,782
Wait!

384
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:22,833
Wait!

385
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,170
He's mine.

386
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,515
So if you want him, you go through me.

387
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,134
But we've already got him.

388
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,729
All right, then. I guess I go through you.

389
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,732
More food.

390
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,427
Thank you.

391
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:53,265
Scrapper 142. I need clearance and an audience with the boss.

392
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,514
I've got something special.

393
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:58,020
Hey! Where are you taking me?

394
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,682
Answer me!

395
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:02,149
Hey!

396
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,978
I am Thor, son of Odin. I need to get back to Asgard.

397
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:08,239
Many apologies, your majesty.

398
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:40,517
It's come to my attention that you don't know who I am.

399
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:51,195
I am Hela, Odin's firstborn...

400
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,568
the commander of the Legions of Asgard...

401
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,486
the rightful heir to the throne,

402
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,116
and the Goddess of Death.

403
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:04,287
My father is dead.

404
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,330
As are the princes. You're welcome.

405
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,424
We were once the seat

406
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,376
of absolute power in the cosmos.

407
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,757
Our supremacy was unchallenged.

408
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:16,015
Yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms.

409
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:19,598
Our destiny is to rule over all others.

410
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:23,560
And I am here to restore that power.

411
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:26,726
Kneel before me...

412
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:30,776
and rise into the ranks of my great conquest.

413
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,113
Whoever you are...

414
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:37,240
whatever you've done, surrender now!

415
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:39,622
Or we will show you no mercy.

416
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,327
Whoever I am?

417
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:44,001
Did you listen to a word I said?

418
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,162
This is your last warning!

419
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:50,508
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

420
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,556
Fine.

421
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,154
Charge!

422
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:08,453
Oh, I've missed this.

423
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,288
Still, it's a shame.

424
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,257
Good soldiers dying for nothing...

425
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:15,505
all because they couldn't see the future.

426
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,212
Sad.

427
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,423
Oh, look, still alive.

428
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,690
Change of heart?

429
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,352
Go back to whatever cave you crept out of.

430
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,112
You evil demoness!

431
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,072
Let's go see my palace.

432
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:14,269
Fear not, for you are found.

433
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,321
You are home, and there is no going back.

434
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,744
No one leaves this place.

435
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,616
But what is this place?

436
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:28,916
The answer is Sakaar.

437
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,045
Surrounded by cosmic gateways...

438
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,964
Sakaar lives on the edge of the known and unknown.

439
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:37,917
It is the collection point

440
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,673
for all lost and unloved things...

441
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:41,629
like you.

442
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,465
But here on Sakaar, you are significant.

443
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,175
You are valuable.

444
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,885
Here you are loved.

445
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:48,969
What the hell?

446
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:52,143
And no one loves you more than the Grandmaster.

447
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,399
He is the original,

448
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,523
the first lost and the first found...

449
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:57,819
the creator of Sakaar ...

450
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,194
and father of the Contest of Champions.

451
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:05,653
Where once you were nothing, now you are something.

452
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:09,035
You are the property of the Grandmaster.

453
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,749
Congratulations!

454
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:14,336
You will meet the Grandmaster in 5 seconds.

455
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:16,039
Prepare yourself.

456
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,083
Prepare yourself.

457
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:24,013
You are now meeting the Grandmaster.

458
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:34,352
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

459
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,187
He's wonderful. It is a he?

460
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:40,692
It is a he.

461
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:41,772
Yeah.

462
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,948
I love when you come to visit, 142.

463
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,610
You bring me the best stuff.

464
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,699
Whenever we get to talking, Topaz,

465
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:49,496
about Scrapper 142...

466
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,074
what do I always say?

467
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,124
"She is the..." And it starts with a "B."

468
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,326
Trash.

469
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,087
No, not trash.

470
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,506
Were you waiting just to call her that?

471
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:00,958
It doesn't start with a "B."

472
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:02,251
Booze hag.

473
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,264
Uh, I'm so sorry. No, "best." I was thinking about "best."

474
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:08,633
'Cause I always say you're the best.

475
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,801
She brought me my beloved champion, you know.

476
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:12,811
You say that every time she's here.

477
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,054
What have you brought today? Tell me.

478
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:15,556
A contender.

479
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:16,765
A what?

480
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,976
I need to go closer. I want a closer look at this.

481
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,107
Can you take us closer? Thank you.

482
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,700
Pay this lady.

483
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:36,494
Just wait a damn minute.

484
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:39,038
I'm not for sale.

485
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,004
Man, he's a fighter.

486
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,464
I take 10 million.

487
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:49,757
Tell her she's dreaming.

488
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,808
Oh, for heaven's sakes, transfer the units.

489
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,400
You'll pay for this.

490
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:01,986
No, I got paid for this.

491
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,356
Here's what I wanna know.

492
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,150
Who are you?

493
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:12,204
I am the God of Thunder.

494
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,698
Wow.

495
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:16,792
I didn't hear any thunder,

496
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,915
but out of your fingers, was that sparkles?

497
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,463
We've located your cousin.

498
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:23,549
Uh, oh, good!

499
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,794
Yeah, come on. I think you're gonna like this.

500
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,127
There he is.

501
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,303
Hey, cuz.

502
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,177
We almost couldn't find you. What, you been hiding?

503
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:32,637
Hi.

504
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,143
Hmm.

505
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:35,345
So...

506
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:36,637
Please.

507
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:38,848
I'm sorry.

508
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,144
Yeah.

509
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,476
Carlo...

510
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:43,860
I pardon you.

511
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:45,404
Oh, thank you.

512
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,480
Thank you.

513
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:49,651
You're officially pardoned. From life.

514
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,699
Help me.

515
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,994
Oh, my God!

516
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:02,379
I'm stepping in it. I'm stepping in it. Look!

517
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,335
Wow.

518
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,295
Oh, the smell.

519
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:07,926
What does it smell like?

520
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:10,383
Burnt toast.

521
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,180
What happened to my manners?

522
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:13,970
I haven't properly introduced myself.

523
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,056
Come on. Uh, follow me.

524
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,478
My name is Grandmaster.

525
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,477
I preside over a little harlequinade

526
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:21,978
called the Contest of Champions.

527
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,646
People come from far and wide

528
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:24,897
to unwillingly participate in it.

529
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,311
And you, my friend,

530
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:27,897
might just be part of the new cast.

531
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,110
What do you say to that?

532
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,192
We're not friends and I don't give a shit about your games.

533
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:32,652
I'm going back to Asgard.

534
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,120
Ass-gard.

535
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,907
One, two, three, four.

536
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,669
There was a wormhole in space and time beneath me.

537
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,998
At that moment, I let go.

538
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:46,248
Loki?

539
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,301
Loki! Loki!

540
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:52,797
Over here. Over here.

541
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,264
- Excuse me one second. - Loki!

542
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:57,430
- What? - You're alive?

543
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,182
- Yes, of course I'm alive. - What are you doing here?

544
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,470
What do you mean, what am I doing?

545
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:01,555
I'm stuck in this stupid chair.

546
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,935
- Where's your chair? - I didn't get a chair.

547
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:04,604
- Get me out of this one. - I can't.

548
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:06,026
- Get me out. What? - I can't.

549
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,102
I've made friends with this man.

550
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,186
He's called the Grandmaster.

551
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:09,397
- Oh, he's crazy! - I've gained his favor.

552
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,156
The Bifrost brought me out here weeks ago.

553
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:12,441
- Weeks ago? - Yes.

554
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,650
I just got here.

555
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:14,902
What are you whispering about?

556
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,821
Time works real different around these parts.

557
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:21,037
On any other world, I'd be, like, millions of years old.

558
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:22,827
But here on Sakaar...

559
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,922
In any case, you know this, uh...

560
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,344
You call yourself Lord of Thunder?

561
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,797
God of Thunder. Tell him.

562
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,677
I've never met this man in my life.

563
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,467
- He's my brother. - Adopted.

564
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,642
Is he any kind of a fighter?

565
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,057
You take this thing

566
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,137
out of my neck and I'll show you.

567
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,980
Now, listen to that. He's threatening me.

568
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,099
Hey, Sparkles, here's the deal.

569
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,485
If you wanna get back to Ass-place, Assberg...

570
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:49,819
Asgard.

571
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:52,740
Any contender who defeats my champion...

572
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,658
their freedom they shall win.

573
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,489
Fine. Then point me in the direction

574
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,036
of whoever's ass I have to kick!

575
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,786
That's what I call, contender.

576
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:03,329
Direction would be this way, Lord.

577
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,002
Ah! Loki!

578
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,877
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy, man.

579
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,679
Over here.

580
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,339
The pile of rocks waving at you. Here.

581
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,058
Yeah, I'm actually a thing. I'm a being.

582
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,893
Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Korg.

583
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,266
I'm kind of like the leader in here.

584
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,305
I'm made of rocks, as you can see.

585
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,857
But don't let that intimidate you.

586
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,312
You don't need to be afraid

587
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:29,939
unless you're made of scissors.

588
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,315
Just a little rock-paper-scissor

589
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:32,396
joke for you.

590
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:35,316
This is my very good friend over here, Miek.

591
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,235
He's an insect and has knives for hands.

592
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,283
You're a Kronan, aren't you?

593
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:43,123
- That I am. - How'd you end up in here?

594
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,083
Ah, well, I tried to start a revolution,

595
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,205
but didn't print enough pamphlets.

596
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,870
So hardly anyone turned up,

597
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:50,547
except for my mum and her boyfriend, who I hate.

598
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,169
As punishment, I was forced

599
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,627
to be in here and become a gladiator.

600
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:56,132
Bit of a promotional disaster, that one.

601
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:59,055
But I'm actually organizing another revolution.

602
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,340
I don't know if you'd be interested

603
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:01,471
in something like that.

604
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:03,223
Do you reckon you'd be interested?

605
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,513
How did you...

606
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,357
Ah, yeah, no. This whole thing is a circle.

607
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:12,690
But not a real circle, more like a freaky circle.

608
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,192
This doesn't make any sense.

609
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:15,568
No, nothing makes sense here, man.

610
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:17,191
The only thing that does make sense

611
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,651
is that nothing makes sense.

612
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:21,203
Has anyone here fought the Grandmaster's champion?

613
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,487
Doug has.

614
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:23,655
Doug!

615
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:24,906
Our luck, Doug's dead.

616
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:25,991
That's right.

617
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:27,250
Everyone who fights

618
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:28,417
the Grandmaster's champion perishes.

619
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,416
What about you? You're made of rocks.

620
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:33,211
Perishable rock. There you go. Another one gone.

621
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,292
Yeah, no, I just do the smaller fights,

622
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,218
warm up the crowd and whatnot.

623
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,129
Wait. You're not gonna face him, are you?

624
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:40,718
Yes, I am.

625
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,800
Gonna fight him, win,

626
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,180
and get the hell out of this place.

627
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,678
That's exactly what Doug used to say.

628
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,730
See you later, new Doug.

629
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,275
Does no one remember me?

630
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,321
Has no one been taught our history?

631
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,460
Look at these lies.

632
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,629
Goblets and garden parties?

633
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,545
Peace treaties?

634
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,586
Odin ...

635
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,337
proud to have it...

636
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,881
ashamed of how he got it.

637
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,444
We were unstoppable.

638
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:45,450
I was his weapon in the conquest

639
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,998
that built Asgard's empire.

640
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:54,167
One by one, the realms became ours.

641
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:58,508
But then, simply because my ambition outgrew his...

642
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:03,343
he banished me, caged me, locked me away like an animal.

643
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:06,387
Before that, Asgard's warriors were honored...

644
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:10,179
their bodies buried as heroes beneath this very palace.

645
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,112
- Odin's treasures. - Fake.

646
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:27,826
Most of the stuff in here is fake.

647
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:29,622
Or weak.

648
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,702
Smaller than I thought it would be.

649
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:36,372
That's not bad.

650
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,127
But this...

651
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,835
The Eternal Flame.

652
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,452
Want to see what true power really looks like?

653
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:42,904
Fenris, my darling, what have they done to you?

654
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:49,445
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.

655
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,924
I've missed you.

656
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,677
I've missed you all.

657
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,510
Odin ...

658
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:16,977
I bid you take your place in the halls of Valhalla...

659
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:19,517
where the brave shall live forever.

660
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,312
Nor shall we mourn but rejoice...

661
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:24,939
for those that have died...

662
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,318
...the glorious death.

663
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:35,703
Hurts, doesn't it?

664
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:36,992
Being lied to.

665
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,377
Being told you're one thing

666
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,329
and then learning it's all a fiction.

667
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:48,170
You didn't think I'd really come and see you, did you?

668
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,088
This place is disgusting.

669
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:54,809
Does this mean you don't want my help?

670
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:57,016
Look, I couldn't jeopardize my position with the Grandmaster.

671
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,555
It took me time to win his trust.

672
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,106
He's a lunatic, but he can be amenable.

673
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:01,650
What I'm telling you is,

674
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:03,523
you could join me at the Grandmaster's side.

675
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:04,769
Perhaps, in time,

676
00:47:04,864 --> 00:47:08,323
an accident befalls the Grandmaster, and then...

677
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,740
You're not seriously thinking of going back, are you?

678
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:21,920
Our sister destroyed your hammer

679
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:23,372
like a piece of glass.

680
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:26,129
She's stronger than both of us. She's stronger than you.

681
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:27,630
You don't stand a chance.

682
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,965
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

683
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:35,508
Fine.

684
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,688
I guess I'll just have to go it alone.

685
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:42,599
Like I've always done.

686
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:46,899
Would you say something?

687
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,111
Say something!

688
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,453
What would you like me to say?

689
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:57,038
You faked your own death...

690
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:59,825
you stole the throne, stripped Odin of his power...

691
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:01,543
stranded him on Earth to die,

692
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:03,245
releasing the Goddess of Death.

693
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,042
Have I said enough or would you like me to go back

694
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,044
further than the past two days?

695
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:10,127
You know, I haven't seen this

696
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:12,258
beloved champion he talks of...

697
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,422
but I've heard he is astonishingly savage.

698
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:17,809
I've placed a large wager against you tomorrow.

699
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:20,178
Don't let me down.

700
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:25,646
Piss off, ghost!

701
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,696
He's freaking gone.

702
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:39,114
Oh, yuck!

703
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,333
There's still someone's hair and blood all over this.

704
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:42,913
Guys, can you clean up the weapons

705
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,210
once you finish your fight?

706
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,370
Disgusting slobs.

707
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,043
Oh, Thor...

708
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:50,338
wanna use a big wooden fork?

709
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:51,709
No.

710
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:53,007
Yeah, not really useful.

711
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:54,929
Unless you're fighting off three vampires

712
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,597
that were huddled together.

713
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,058
I really wish I had my hammer.

714
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:00,468
Hammer?

715
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,179
Quite unique. It was made from this

716
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,230
special metal from the heart of a dying star.

717
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:06,274
And when I spun it really, really fast,

718
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,851
it gave me the ability to fly.

719
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:08,977
You rode a hammer?

720
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:10,649
No, I didn't ride the hammer.

721
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:12,314
The hammer rode you on your back?

722
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,073
No. I used to spin it really fast,

723
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,742
and it would pull me off the...

724
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:17,911
Oh, my God. A hammer pulled you off?

725
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:19,738
The ground. It would pull me off the ground,

726
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:21,619
up into the air, and I would fly.

727
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:22,907
Every time I threw it,

728
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:24,789
it would always come back to me.

729
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:26,287
Sounds like you had a pretty special

730
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,746
and intimate relationship with this hammer...

731
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:28,956
and that losing it

732
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,836
was almost comparable to losing a loved one.

733
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,052
That's a nice way of putting it.

734
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:36,964
I said they're mine.

735
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,383
See her, that's the one that put me in here.

736
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:42,936
Oh, yeah. Scrapper 142.

737
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:45,139
Gotta watch out for those Asgardians, man.

738
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,814
They are hard to perish.

739
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:48,392
Asgardian?

740
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,103
Hey. Hey.

741
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:53,855
Hey.

742
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,858
Do not zap me with that thing. I just wanna talk.

743
00:49:58,579 --> 00:49:59,945
Asgard is in danger.

744
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,917
My God, you're a Valkyrie.

745
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,212
I used to wanna be a Valkyrie when I was younger...

746
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,835
until I found out that you were all women.

747
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:12,999
There's nothing wrong with women, of course.

748
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,083
I love women.

749
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:15,714
Sometimes a little too much.

750
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:16,966
Not in a creepy way,

751
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:18,763
just more of a respectful appreciation.

752
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:20,299
I think it's great that there is

753
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:23,430
an elite force of women warriors.

754
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,098
It's about time.

755
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:27,723
Are you done?

756
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:28,806
Lord of Thunder, you're up.

757
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:29,982
Please, help me. I need your help.

758
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:31,059
Bye.

759
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,315
Fine, then you must be a traitor or a coward.

760
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:35,856
Because the Valkyrie is sworn to protect the throne.

761
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:39,656
Listen closely, your majesty. This is Sakaar, not Asgard.

762
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,869
And I'm a Scrapper, not a Valkyrie.

763
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:47,075
Bring him in for processing.

764
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:51,171
And no one escapes this place. So you're gonna die anyway.

765
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:04,559
Now, don't you move.

766
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:07,429
My hands ain't as steady as they used to be.

767
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:10,478
By Odin's beard, you shall not cut my hair...

768
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:13,276
lest you feel the wrath of the mighty Thor.

769
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:20,025
Please. Please, kind sir, do not cut my hair.

770
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:22,702
Please! No!

771
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:23,949
No!

772
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,003
Wow! Look at all of you.

773
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,758
What a show! What a night!

774
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:42,005
Who's having fun?

775
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,799
Please, I'm your host.

776
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,221
Big round of applause

777
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:48,178
for all of our undercard competitors...

778
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:51,147
who today died so gruesomely.

779
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,516
Good sports.

780
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,358
What a show! What a night!

781
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:58,689
This is what you've come for, and so have I.

782
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:07,581
And now, without further ado...

783
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:10,158
it's main event time.

784
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,544
Making his first appearance,

785
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:15,167
though he looks quite promising...

786
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:17,295
got a couple of tricks up his sleeve.

787
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,339
I'll say no more, see what you think.

788
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,007
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...

789
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,302
Lord of Thunder.

790
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:50,786
Watch out for his fingers. They make sparks.

791
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,208
Okay, this is it.

792
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:55,624
Let's get ready to welcome this guy. Here he comes.

793
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:06,051
He is a creature.

794
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,552
What can we say about him?

795
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:10,101
Well, he's unique. There's none like him.

796
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:12,767
I feel a special connection with him.

797
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:15,769
He's undefeated.

798
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:18,647
He's the reigning.

799
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:23,110
He's the defending.

800
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:24,607
Ladies and gentlemen...

801
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,025
I give you...

802
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:27,360
Uh-oh.

803
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:34,580
...your Incredible...

804
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:40,256
Hulk!

805
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,216
Yes!

806
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:48,013
I have to get off this planet.

807
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:50,508
Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?

808
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,018
Hey!

809
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:01,945
We know each other.

810
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:04,272
He's a friend from work.

811
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,203
Where have you been?

812
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:17,411
Everybody thought you were dead.

813
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:19,500
But so much has happened since I last saw you.

814
00:54:20,132 --> 00:54:21,668
I lost my hammer.

815
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:24,801
Like, yesterday, so that's still pretty fresh.

816
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,507
Loki. Loki's alive. Can you believe it?

817
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:28,842
He's up there.

818
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,969
Loki! Look who it is!

819
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,220
Banner, I never thought I would say this...

820
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:37,556
but I'm happy to see you.

821
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,233
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!

822
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:47,023
Banner.

823
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,401
Hey, Banner!

824
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:51,987
No Banner. Only Hulk.

825
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:53,534
What are you doing?

826
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:55,490
It's me. It's Thor!

827
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,182
Banner, we're friends.

828
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,229
This is crazy. I don't want to hurt you!

829
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:28,197
Here we go.

830
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,133
What?

831
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:00,055
Hey, big guy.

832
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,891
The sun's getting real low.

833
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,538
That's it. The sun's going down.

834
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:22,251
I won't hurt you anymore.

835
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:23,912
No one will.

836
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,093
Yes! That's how it feels!

837
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:41,224
I'm just a huge fan of the sport.

838
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:51,364
All right. Screw it.

839
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:58,530
Oh!

840
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:04,209
I know you're in there, Banner.

841
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:05,286
I'll get you out!

842
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,513
What's the matter with you? You're embarrassing me!

843
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:17,883
I told them we were friends!

844
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:52,235
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

845
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:58,822
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

846
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:33,101
Another day, another Doug.

847
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,282
What is that noise?

848
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:47,202
The common folk aren't exactly falling in line.

849
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:51,293
There's a resistance trying to knock down the front gates.

850
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,584
Tell me about yourself, Skurge.

851
00:59:59,096 --> 01:00:01,304
Well, me dad was a stonemason. Me mum was...

852
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:03,468
Right, yeah, I'll just stop you there.

853
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:05,299
What I meant was...

854
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:07,097
what's your ambition?

855
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:11,639
I just want a chance to prove myself.

856
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,390
Recognition.

857
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:15,018
When I was young...

858
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:18,938
every great king had an executioner.

859
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:21,153
Not just to execute people...

860
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:23,909
but also to execute their vision.

861
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:27,701
But mainly to execute people.

862
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:29,911
Still, it was a great honor.

863
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:34,461
I was Odin's executioner.

864
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:39,842
And you shall be my executioner.

865
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,341
Let's begin our conquest.

866
01:00:58,864 --> 01:01:00,275
Skurge, where's the sword?

867
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:09,414
That sword is the key to opening the Bifrost.

868
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,366
Those people you mentioned,

869
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:13,451
the ones who aren't falling into line...

870
01:01:14,129 --> 01:01:15,210
round them up.

871
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:40,565
Excuse me.

872
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:54,078
Sorry about that.

873
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:55,455
These bloody things are everywhere.

874
01:01:56,922 --> 01:01:57,912
Come on.

875
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:34,456
You'll be safe here.

876
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:44,935
Are we cool?

877
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,236
It's Hulk in a hot tub.

878
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:53,111
So how long have you been like that?

879
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:54,824
Like what?

880
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:58,746
Like this. Big, and green, and stupid.

881
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:02,040
Hulk always Hulk.

882
01:04:07,052 --> 01:04:08,213
How'd you get here?

883
01:04:09,137 --> 01:04:10,127
Winning.

884
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:11,803
You mean cheating, huh?

885
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:14,223
Were they wearing one of these when you won?

886
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:15,637
How'd you arrive here?

887
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:19,636
Quinjet.

888
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:22,356
Yes. Now, where is the Quinjet now?

889
01:04:27,322 --> 01:04:29,188
That's naked.

890
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:32,066
He's very naked. Hmm.

891
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:36,866
It's in my brain now.

892
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:38,697
Quinjet.

893
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:50,717
Yes!

894
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:52,337
I'm getting us out of here.

895
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,964
This is a terrible, awful place.

896
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:58,844
You're gonna love Asgard. It's big. It's golden. Shiny.

897
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:00,386
Hulk stay.

898
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:03,939
No, no, no. My people need me to get back to Asgard.

899
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:06,480
We must prevent Ragnarok.

900
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:07,901
Ragnarok?

901
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:09,778
The prophesied death of my home world.

902
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,196
The end of days, it's the end of...

903
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:15,575
If you help me get back to Asgard...

904
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,827
I can help you get back to Earth. Huh?

905
01:05:18,123 --> 01:05:19,113
Earth hate Hulk.

906
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:20,748
Earth loves Hulk. They love you.

907
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:22,333
You're one of the Avengers.

908
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:23,626
One of the team, one of our friends.

909
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:26,086
This is what friends do. They support each other.

910
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:27,462
You're Banner's friend.

911
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:29,794
I'm not Banner's friend. I prefer you.

912
01:05:30,135 --> 01:05:31,125
Banner's friend.

913
01:05:31,219 --> 01:05:32,209
I don't even like Banner.

914
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:35,133
"I'm into numbers and science and stuff."

915
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:37,093
Thor go. Hulk stay.

916
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:38,507
Fine.

917
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:40,092
Stay here.

918
01:05:40,979 --> 01:05:43,312
Stupid place. It's hideous, by the way.

919
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:46,940
The red, the white. Just pick a color. Ridiculous.

920
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:48,983
Smash you.

921
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:51,441
You didn't smash anything. I won that fight.

922
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:53,731
- I smashed you. - Yeah, sure, sure.

923
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:55,649
- Baby arms. - What?

924
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,113
Baby.

925
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,614
Moron! You big child.

926
01:05:58,913 --> 01:05:59,994
Thor go!

927
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:01,822
I am going.

928
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,203
Thor go again.

929
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:13,254
Thor home.

930
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:24,853
Hulk trains.

931
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:27,105
That's great. Have fun.

932
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:29,020
- Hey, big guy. - Angry girl.

933
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:30,313
What have you been up to?

934
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:31,643
Winning.

935
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:45,249
Heimdall, I know you can see me.

936
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,376
I need you to help me.

937
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:51,830
Help me see.

938
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:04,685
I see you, but you're far away.

939
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:06,808
What's going on here?

940
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:08,434
Come see for yourself.

941
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:12,651
I'm providing refuge in a stronghold

942
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:13,727
built by our ancestors.

943
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:17,482
But if the garrison falls, our only escape is Bifrost.

944
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:19,696
You're talking about evacuating Asgard?

945
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,784
We won't last long if we stay.

946
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:26,790
She draws her power from Asgard

947
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:27,992
and grows stronger every day.

948
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:29,284
Come on.

949
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:34,749
Hela is ravenous.

950
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,041
If I let her leave,

951
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:37,922
she'll consume Nine Realms and all the cosmos.

952
01:07:38,263 --> 01:07:39,253
We need you.

953
01:07:39,347 --> 01:07:40,428
I'm working on it. But I don't even know

954
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:41,505
where the hell I am.

955
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,095
You're on a planet surrounded by doorways. Go through one.

956
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:46,181
- Which one? - The big one.

957
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:16,419
Thor sad.

958
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:17,965
Shut up.

959
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:21,803
Thor sad.

960
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:24,673
I'm not sad, you idiot.

961
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:26,800
- I'm pissed off! - Oh.

962
01:08:27,979 --> 01:08:30,437
Angry. I lost my father.

963
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:34,149
I lost my hammer.

964
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:35,859
- You're not even listening. - Whining and crying.

965
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,106
Cry like baby.

966
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:38,987
Don't kick stuff.

967
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:42,445
You're being a really bad friend.

968
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:43,734
You bad friend!

969
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,201
- You know what we call you? - No.

970
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:47,071
We call you the stupid Avenger.

971
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:49,289
You're tiny Avenger!

972
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:53,076
What, are you crazy?

973
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:54,286
Yes.

974
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:56,831
You know what? Earth does hate you.

975
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:19,611
No. Mmm-mmm.

976
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:24,654
I'm sorry I said those things.

977
01:09:25,536 --> 01:09:26,777
You're not the stupid Avenger.

978
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:28,908
Nobody calls you the stupid Avenger.

979
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:31,035
It's okay.

980
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:32,407
You just can't go around throwing shields

981
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:33,618
at people. Could have killed me.

982
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:34,918
I know. I'm sorry.

983
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,666
I just get so angry all the time.

984
01:09:36,756 --> 01:09:38,793
Hulk always, always angry.

985
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:41,341
I know. We're the same, you and I.

986
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:43,426
We're just a couple of hot-headed fools.

987
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:47,473
Yeah, same. Hulk like fire, Thor like water.

988
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:50,183
We're kind of both like fire.

989
01:09:50,478 --> 01:09:52,344
But Hulk like real fire.

990
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:55,765
Hulk like raging fire.

991
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:58,142
Thor like smoldering fire.

992
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,521
Hulk, I need you to do something for me.

993
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:03,689
Hmm?

994
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,571
Angry girl.

995
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:20,164
What's going on? What are you...

996
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,057
You're so thick-headed that you can't tell...

997
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:32,684
when someone's hiding all the way across

998
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:34,056
the universe and wants to be left alone.

999
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:36,847
- We need to talk. - No, you wanna talk to me.

1000
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:38,770
I need her to stay.

1001
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:39,933
Stay?

1002
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:41,560
Block.

1003
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:44,984
Stay.

1004
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,656
- Please. - Please.

1005
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:50,444
All right.

1006
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,497
Here's the deal.

1007
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:56,791
I'll listen to you...

1008
01:10:57,628 --> 01:10:58,835
till this is empty.

1009
01:11:00,465 --> 01:11:02,582
Asgard is in danger and people are dying.

1010
01:11:02,884 --> 01:11:04,250
We need to get back there. I need your help.

1011
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:05,792
Wow.

1012
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:08,299
Finished. Bye.

1013
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:11,298
Odin is dead.

1014
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:16,895
Hela, the Goddess of Death, has invaded Asgard.

1015
01:11:17,857 --> 01:11:20,315
If Hela's back, then Asgard's already lost.

1016
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:21,858
I'm going to stop her.

1017
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:23,852
- Alone? - Nope.

1018
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:25,320
I'm putting together a team.

1019
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:28,273
It's me, you, and the big guy.

1020
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:30,868
No. No team. Only Hulk.

1021
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:32,619
It's me and you.

1022
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:33,987
I think it's only you.

1023
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:36,368
Wait. Just listen. The Valkyrie are legend.

1024
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:38,875
Elite warriors of Asgard sworn to defend the throne.

1025
01:11:39,879 --> 01:11:40,869
I'm not getting dragged into

1026
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:41,953
another one of Odin's family squabbles.

1027
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:44,331
- What's that supposed to mean? - Your sister.

1028
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:46,421
Her power comes from Asgard, same as yours.

1029
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:47,835
When it grew beyond Odin's control

1030
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:49,090
she massacred everyone in the palace...

1031
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:50,720
and tried to seize the throne.

1032
01:11:51,182 --> 01:11:52,718
When she tried to escape her banishment...

1033
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:55,096
he sent the Valkyrie in to fight her back.

1034
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:58,721
I only survived because...

1035
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:01,852
Look, I already faced her once

1036
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:03,684
back when I believed in the throne...

1037
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:05,022
and it cost me everything.

1038
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:06,854
That's what's wrong with Asgard.

1039
01:12:06,948 --> 01:12:09,315
The throne, the secrets, the whole golden sham.

1040
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:10,858
I agree.

1041
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:13,152
Don't get familiar.

1042
01:12:13,788 --> 01:12:15,029
I agree.

1043
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,697
That's why I turned down the throne.

1044
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:18,865
But this isn't about the crown.

1045
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:19,996
This is about the people.

1046
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:22,126
They're dying and they're your people, too.

1047
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:23,746
Forget it.

1048
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:26,123
I have.

1049
01:12:26,384 --> 01:12:27,465
- Okay. - Okay.

1050
01:12:27,718 --> 01:12:28,799
- Good. Great. - Great.

1051
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,001
Thank you.

1052
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:31,673
- For what? - For this.

1053
01:12:33,391 --> 01:12:35,223
Didn't see that, did you?

1054
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:38,806
There... That's better.

1055
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:42,389
You know, go ahead.

1056
01:12:42,692 --> 01:12:47,062
Stay here and enslave people for that lunatic.

1057
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:48,604
Keep drinking, keep hiding.

1058
01:12:48,906 --> 01:12:49,987
But me...

1059
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,908
I choose to run toward my problems

1060
01:12:53,995 --> 01:12:55,111
and not away from them.

1061
01:12:56,414 --> 01:12:57,495
Because that's what...

1062
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:04,624
Because that's what heroes do.

1063
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:17,595
Friend stay!

1064
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:30,775
Yes!

1065
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:46,369
All right.

1066
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:51,374
Come on.

1067
01:13:54,055 --> 01:13:56,342
Welcome. Voice activation required.

1068
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:58,132

Damn you, Stark.

Point Break.

1080
01:14:16,327 --> 01:14:18,319
Welcome, Point Break.

1081
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:21,954
Friend stay!

1082
01:14:22,249 --> 01:14:24,241
No, no, no! Stop!

1083
01:14:24,335 --> 01:14:26,042
Stay!

1084
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:27,620
Stop! Stop breaking everything!

1085
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:29,254
Don't go!

1086
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:33,879
Nice work, big guy.

1087
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:35,377
We don't know where Ultron's headed,

1088
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:37,508
but you're going very high, very fast.

1089
01:14:37,807 --> 01:14:39,264
So, I need you to turn this bird around, okay?

1090
01:14:40,101 --> 01:14:42,514
We can't track you in stealth mode...

1091
01:14:42,937 --> 01:14:44,428
so I need you to help me out. Okay?

1092
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:49,683
I need you to...

1093
01:15:05,793 --> 01:15:08,160
No! No, Banner!

1094
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:16,922
Oh, jeez.

1095
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:19,346
Banner.

1096
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:22,056
Hey, hey, hey.

1097
01:15:22,309 --> 01:15:23,641
You all right, Banner?

1098
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:27,971
Sun's going down. Sun's going down.

1099
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:29,810
That's it, breathe.

1100
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:32,358
I won't hurt you.

1101
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:34,269
Sun's going down.

1102
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:35,816
- Thor. - Yeah.

1103
01:15:36,824 --> 01:15:38,065
What happened to your hair?

1104
01:15:38,325 --> 01:15:39,532
Some creepy old man cut it off.

1105
01:15:39,827 --> 01:15:41,113
- It looks good. - Oh, thanks.

1106
01:15:41,412 --> 01:15:43,529
Where are we? Oh, how's Nat?

1107
01:15:44,123 --> 01:15:46,740
- Uh, Nat is good, I'm sure. - Is she okay?

1108
01:15:47,084 --> 01:15:48,746
- And what about Sokovia? - Sokovia?

1109
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:50,377
The city, Sokovia. Did we save it?

1110
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:51,749
- Banner, listen. - What?

1111
01:15:52,006 --> 01:15:53,872
Sokovia. Ultron. That was two years ago.

1112
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:55,582
- What are you saying? - Well...

1113
01:15:55,843 --> 01:15:56,833
What?

1114
01:15:57,762 --> 01:15:59,003
I've been Hulk for two years?

1115
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:00,754
I'm afraid so.

1116
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:07,969
What the hell happened?

1117
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:13,103
Banner, there's something you should know.

1118
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:16,770
Voice activation required.

1119
01:16:16,906 --> 01:16:17,896
Banner.

1120
01:16:18,115 --> 01:16:19,526
Welcome, strongest Avenger.

1121
01:16:19,742 --> 01:16:20,732
Uh, what?

1122
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:21,816
Ship's log.

1123
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:34,837
Thor, where are we?

1124
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:36,122
Yeah, about that.

1125
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:37,541
Sorry, hear ye.

1126
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:39,342
Attention please. I have some bad news.

1127
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:42,258
My beloved exalted champion has turned up missing.

1128
01:16:42,473 --> 01:16:44,715
Take to the streets. Celebrate my champion.

1129
01:16:44,809 --> 01:16:45,799
Who's that?

1130
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:47,634
He kind of runs the place.

1131
01:16:48,562 --> 01:16:49,803
You actually lived at his house for awhile.

1132
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:50,887
- I did? - Yeah.

1133
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:53,014
Quite a lot's happened. You and I had a fight recently.

1134
01:16:53,818 --> 01:16:55,525
- Did I win? - No, I won. Easily.

1135
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:56,976
Doesn't sound right.

1136
01:16:57,071 --> 01:16:58,061
Well, it's true.

1137
01:16:58,155 --> 01:17:00,192
It seems that that criminally seductive

1138
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:02,615
Lord of Thunder has stolen him away.

1139
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:05,280
Seductive God of Thunder. We need to move.

1140
01:17:06,247 --> 01:17:07,237
Oh, no.

1141
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:10,206
This is bad.

1142
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:12,249
This is really, really bad.

1143
01:17:15,214 --> 01:17:18,673
Thor, I think I'm freaking out.

1144
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:20,254
No no no.

1145
01:17:20,427 --> 01:17:22,259
Don't freak out. You're okay. Put these on.

1146
01:17:22,513 --> 01:17:23,549
These are Tony's clothes.

1147
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:24,929
- I know, come on. - Is he here?

1148
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:27,011
No, he's not here. But listen. Just stay calm, okay?

1149
01:17:27,226 --> 01:17:29,309
The sun's going down. The sun's getting really low.

1150
01:17:29,395 --> 01:17:30,385
Sun's going down.

1151
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:39,982
I'm upset!

1152
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:44,862
I'm very upset.

1153
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:46,993
You know what I like about being upset? The blame.

1154
01:17:47,371 --> 01:17:49,454
Right now, that's the mindset that I'm in.

1155
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:50,530
And you know who I'm blaming?

1156
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:52,282
- Grandmaster, I can... - Hey!

1157
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:53,449
Don't interrupt me!

1158
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:54,659
Here you go.

1159
01:17:55,588 --> 01:17:56,795
Why are you handing me the melt stick?

1160
01:17:57,131 --> 01:17:58,747
He was interrupting.

1161
01:17:59,133 --> 01:18:00,795
That's not a capital violation.

1162
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:02,254
Where was I?

1163
01:18:02,803 --> 01:18:05,136
My precious champion has come up missing...

1164
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:07,388
and it's all because of that Lord of Thunder.

1165
01:18:07,474 --> 01:18:09,636
It's all because of him. Your brother.

1166
01:18:09,935 --> 01:18:12,769
Whatever the story is. Adopted, or complicated.

1167
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:13,928
I'm sure there's a big history.

1168
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:15,180
And your contender...

1169
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:16,931
My dear friend...

1170
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:19,066
if you were to give me 12 hours,

1171
01:18:19,153 --> 01:18:20,519
I could bring them both back to you. Alive.

1172
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:22,190
I could do it in two.

1173
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:24,189
I could do it in one.

1174
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:25,440
Let's stop there.

1175
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:27,366
You know what? I woke up this morning

1176
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:29,160
thinking about a public execution.

1177
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:31,196
But for now, I'll settle for this sweet little...

1178
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:34,248
"Who's gonna get him first?"

1179
01:18:35,336 --> 01:18:37,828
So, you're on the clock.

1180
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:40,921
What have you done?

1181
01:18:41,008 --> 01:18:42,249
I don't answer to you, lackey.

1182
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:43,374
It's Loki.

1183
01:18:43,594 --> 01:18:45,085
And you will answer to the Grandmaster.

1184
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:48,046
Hmm.

1185
01:18:48,349 --> 01:18:51,057
Why would you help my brother escape with that green fool?

1186
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:52,593
I don't help anyone.

1187
01:18:59,276 --> 01:19:00,266
You're a Valkyrie.

1188
01:19:05,366 --> 01:19:07,358
I thought the Valkyrie had all died gruesome deaths.

1189
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:10,277
Choose your next words wisely.

1190
01:19:10,621 --> 01:19:13,705
I'm terribly sorry. Must be a very painful memory.

1191
01:20:06,677 --> 01:20:09,010
The sun's going down. It's getting really low.

1192
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:11,554
The sun's going down.

1193
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,051
- It's getting real low. - Oh, shoot.

1194
01:20:13,434 --> 01:20:15,642
- Sun's getting low. - Would you stop saying that?

1195
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:16,764
I just need you to stay calm.

1196
01:20:17,021 --> 01:20:18,853
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!

1197
01:20:19,148 --> 01:20:20,764
It's just a planet. You've been on a planet before.

1198
01:20:20,858 --> 01:20:21,894
Yeah. One.

1199
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:23,770
Now you've been on two. That's a good thing.

1200
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:25,185
It's a new experience.

1201
01:20:25,404 --> 01:20:27,316
My neurons, they're firing faster

1202
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:29,398
than my brain can handle the information.

1203
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:31,820
The whole thing is totally different this time.

1204
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:33,826
In the past, I always felt like Hulk and I

1205
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:35,198
each had a hand on the wheel.

1206
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:37,243
But this time, it's like he had the keys

1207
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:38,869
to the car and I was locked in the trunk.

1208
01:20:39,126 --> 01:20:40,913
All right, well, you're back now. That's all that matters.

1209
01:20:41,128 --> 01:20:42,164
No, it's not what matters.

1210
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:43,415
What I'm trying to tell you, is that

1211
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:45,041
if I turn into the Hulk again...

1212
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:46,665
Banner may never come back.

1213
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:48,174
And we're stranded on a planet

1214
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:50,001
that is designed to stress me out.

1215
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:51,211
We're not stranded.

1216
01:20:51,305 --> 01:20:52,637
I'm gonna figure out a way to get us home.

1217
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:54,172
Thank you.

1218
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:56,508
Not your home, though. Asgard. My home.

1219
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:57,888
What?

1220
01:20:58,145 --> 01:20:59,727
Listen, my people are in great danger.

1221
01:21:00,314 --> 01:21:02,476
You and I, we have to fight this really powerful being...

1222
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:04,474
who also happens to be my sister.

1223
01:21:04,735 --> 01:21:06,397
Okay, that is so wrong on so many...

1224
01:21:06,612 --> 01:21:07,693
I don't wanna fight your sister.

1225
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:09,021
That's a family issue.

1226
01:21:09,156 --> 01:21:10,397
No, she's an evil being.

1227
01:21:10,491 --> 01:21:12,278
I don't care what she is.

1228
01:21:12,368 --> 01:21:14,530
I'm not fighting any more beings. I'm sick of it.

1229
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:15,777
- What? - I just told you.

1230
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:17,612
If I turn into the Hulk,

1231
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:18,867
I am never gonna come back again.

1232
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:20,119
And you don't care.

1233
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:21,999
No, no. I'm putting together the team.

1234
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:23,501
The Hulk is the fire.

1235
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:25,458
Wait, you're just using me to get to the Hulk.

1236
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:27,125
- What? No! - It's gross.

1237
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:29,045
You don't care about me. You're not my friend.

1238
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:31,042
No! I don't even like the Hulk.

1239
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:32,377
He's all like...

1240
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:33,965
"Smash, smash, smash."

1241
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:35,213
I prefer you.

1242
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:37,131
Thanks.

1243
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:39,509
But if I'm being honest,

1244
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:40,969
when it comes to fighting evil beings...

1245
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:42,516
he is very powerful and useful.

1246
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:44,643
Yeah, Banner's powerful and useful, too.

1247
01:21:44,942 --> 01:21:46,023
Is he though?

1248
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:48,310
How many PhDs does Hulk have? Zero.

1249
01:21:48,529 --> 01:21:50,270
How many PhDs does Banner have? Seven.

1250
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:53,106
Fine, you don't have to fight anyone.

1251
01:21:53,367 --> 01:21:55,154
But we're in danger here, so we have to move.

1252
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:00,325
What are you doing with that?

1253
01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:01,489
I need a disguise. I'm a fugitive.

1254
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:03,245
- I need a disguise. - You are the disguise.

1255
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:05,585
- I'll be Tony Stark. - What?

1256
01:22:05,963 --> 01:22:07,545
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.

1257
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:10,248
No, no, you're not Tony. You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.

1258
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:11,716
Then why did you dress me up like Tony?

1259
01:22:11,969 --> 01:22:12,959
Because you were naked.

1260
01:22:13,137 --> 01:22:14,253
Okay, I'll give you that.

1261
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:16,387
What are you doing? Stop doing that!

1262
01:22:16,473 --> 01:22:17,839
Tony wears his pants super tight.

1263
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:18,923
- Stop it! - I'm sorry.

1264
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:21,260
- Why are you being so weird? - I don't know.

1265
01:22:21,562 --> 01:22:23,804
Maybe the fact that I was trapped for two years...

1266
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:26,435
inside of a monster made me a little weird.

1267
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:28,353
Hey. Shh. It's okay.

1268
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:30,897
You're good. Calm down. Come on.

1269
01:22:31,155 --> 01:22:32,441
Listen, we're gonna go to Asgard...

1270
01:22:32,698 --> 01:22:33,688
and you're not gonna have to think about

1271
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:34,772
the Hulk ever again.

1272
01:22:35,075 --> 01:22:36,111
- All right? - All right.

1273
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:41,867
Hulk!

1274
01:22:43,834 --> 01:22:45,416
Oh. This is bad.

1275
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:50,922
Banner! Banner!

1276
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:56,006
Banner!

1277
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:10,729
Banner!

1278
01:23:11,278 --> 01:23:12,394
Thor!

1279
01:23:23,707 --> 01:23:24,697
Hi.

1280
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:25,990
Hi.

1281
01:23:26,251 --> 01:23:27,492
I was gonna do that.

1282
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:28,702
Yeah, well, I did it first.

1283
01:23:29,087 --> 01:23:30,874
That's good. What are you doing here?

1284
01:23:31,924 --> 01:23:33,506
What are you doing here? I thought you were leaving.

1285
01:23:33,717 --> 01:23:34,707
I got sidetracked.

1286
01:23:35,177 --> 01:23:36,167
What's with the...

1287
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:37,759
It's my disguise.

1288
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:38,920
But I can see your face.

1289
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:41,013
Not when I do this, you can't.

1290
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:43,549
Your hair looks nice. I like what you did with it.

1291
01:23:43,644 --> 01:23:45,055
Change it? Washed it maybe?

1292
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:52,517
What are those things on her eyes?

1293
01:23:52,611 --> 01:23:53,943
Are those the people that she's killed?

1294
01:23:54,196 --> 01:23:55,653
She's so beautiful and strong and courageous.

1295
01:23:55,948 --> 01:23:56,938
Who is this guy?

1296
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:58,022
- He's a friend. - Who? Me?

1297
01:23:58,116 --> 01:23:59,448
- I'm Bruce. - I feel like I know you.

1298
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:01,613
I feel like I know you, too.

1299
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:08,157
Look, I've spent years in a haze,

1300
01:24:08,252 --> 01:24:09,618
- trying to forget my past. - Mmm.

1301
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:11,456
Sakaar seemed like the best place

1302
01:24:11,547 --> 01:24:13,789
to drink and forget, and to die one day.

1303
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:15,790
I was thinking that you drink too much,

1304
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:17,250
and that probably was gonna kill you.

1305
01:24:17,427 --> 01:24:18,508
I don't plan to stop drinking.

1306
01:24:18,679 --> 01:24:20,887
- Oh. - But I don't wanna forget.

1307
01:24:21,139 --> 01:24:22,675
I can't turn away anymore...

1308
01:24:23,433 --> 01:24:25,095
so if I'm gonna die...

1309
01:24:25,394 --> 01:24:26,976
well, it may as well be driving my sword

1310
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:28,428
through the heart of that murderous hag.

1311
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:30,187
- Good. - Yeah.

1312
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:33,350
So, I'm saying that I wanna be on the team.

1313
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:35,276
Has it got a name?

1314
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:38,150
Yeah, it's called the Revengers.

1315
01:24:38,532 --> 01:24:39,522
Revengers?

1316
01:24:39,616 --> 01:24:41,983
Because I'm getting revenge. You're getting revenge.

1317
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:45,156
Do you want revenge?

1318
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:47,447
I'm undecided.

1319
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:48,739
Okay.

1320
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:51,125
Also, I've got a peace offering.

1321
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:56,255
Surprise.

1322
01:25:02,014 --> 01:25:03,255
Ow.

1323
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:04,722
Just had to be sure.

1324
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:09,510
Hello, Bruce.

1325
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:12,680
So, last time I saw you,

1326
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:13,890
you were trying to kill everybody.

1327
01:25:14,192 --> 01:25:15,273
Where are you at these days?

1328
01:25:15,861 --> 01:25:17,568
It varies from moment to moment.

1329
01:25:18,405 --> 01:25:19,862
Is that a Dragonfang?

1330
01:25:20,532 --> 01:25:21,613
It is.

1331
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:22,736
My God.

1332
01:25:23,827 --> 01:25:25,784
This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie.

1333
01:25:25,871 --> 01:25:27,703
Sakaar and Asgard are about as far apart

1334
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:28,950
as any two known systems.

1335
01:25:29,458 --> 01:25:31,950
Our best bet is a wormhole just outside of city limits.

1336
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:34,243
Refuel on Xandar, and we can be back in Asgard

1337
01:25:34,338 --> 01:25:35,795
in 18 months.

1338
01:25:36,089 --> 01:25:39,207
Nope. We are going through the big one.

1339
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:40,458
The Devil's Anus?

1340
01:25:40,844 --> 01:25:41,834
Anus?

1341
01:25:42,012 --> 01:25:43,002
Wait, wait, wait. Whose anus?

1342
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:44,211
For the record, I didn't know

1343
01:25:44,306 --> 01:25:45,296
it was called that when I picked it.

1344
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:46,972
That looks like a collapsing neutron star...

1345
01:25:47,059 --> 01:25:49,472
inside of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

1346
01:25:49,895 --> 01:25:51,056
We need another ship.

1347
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:52,557
That would tear mine to pieces.

1348
01:25:52,856 --> 01:25:54,392
She's right. We need one that can withstand

1349
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:55,564
the geodetic strain from the singularity.

1350
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:57,691
And has an offline power steering system...

1351
01:25:57,778 --> 01:26:00,395
that could also function without the on-board computer.

1352
01:26:00,697 --> 01:26:01,983
And we need one with cup holders,

1353
01:26:02,074 --> 01:26:03,610
because we're gonna die. So, drinks!

1354
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:05,779
Do I know you? I feel like I know you.

1355
01:26:06,036 --> 01:26:07,777
I feel like I know you, too. It's weird.

1356
01:26:08,038 --> 01:26:09,028
What do you say?

1357
01:26:09,373 --> 01:26:10,363
Uncharted metagalactic travel

1358
01:26:10,457 --> 01:26:11,664
through a volatile cosmic gateway.

1359
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,081
Talk about an adventure.

1360
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:15,371
- We need a ship. - Need a ship.

1361
01:26:15,629 --> 01:26:16,619
There are one or two ships.

1362
01:26:16,713 --> 01:26:17,703
Absolute top of the line models...

1363
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:19,167
I don't mean to impose...

1364
01:26:22,636 --> 01:26:24,172
But the Grandmaster has a great many ships.

1365
01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:26,254
I may even have stolen

1366
01:26:26,348 --> 01:26:28,305
the access codes to his security system.

1367
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:29,590
And suddenly you're overcome

1368
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:30,766
with an urge to do the right thing.

1369
01:26:31,061 --> 01:26:32,051
Heavens, no.

1370
01:26:32,145 --> 01:26:33,761
I've run out of favor with the Grandmaster...

1371
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:35,687
and in exchange for codes and access to a ship...

1372
01:26:35,982 --> 01:26:39,020
I'm asking for safe passage through the Anus.

1373
01:26:39,403 --> 01:26:40,735
You're telling us that you can get us

1374
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:41,937
access into the garage...

1375
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,646
without setting off any alarms?

1376
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:45,652
Yes, brother. I can.

1377
01:26:45,909 --> 01:26:48,572
Okay, can I just... A quick FYI.

1378
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:50,452
I was just talking to him just a couple minutes ago...

1379
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:53,073
and he was totally ready to kill any of us.

1380
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:54,414
He did try to kill me.

1381
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:56,417
Yes, me too. On many, many occasions.

1382
01:26:56,712 --> 01:26:58,169
There was one time when we were children...

1383
01:26:58,422 --> 01:26:59,879
he transformed himself into a snake,

1384
01:26:59,965 --> 01:27:01,081
and he knows that I love snakes.

1385
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:03,082
So, I went to pick up the snake to admire it...

1386
01:27:03,343 --> 01:27:04,754
and he transformed back into himself

1387
01:27:04,845 --> 01:27:05,961
and he was like, "Yeah, it's me!"

1388
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:09,089
And he stabbed me. We were eight at the time.

1389
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:10,761
If we're boosting a ship...

1390
01:27:10,976 --> 01:27:12,467
we're gonna need to draw some guards away from the palace.

1391
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:14,014
Why not set the beast loose?

1392
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:15,219
Shut up.

1393
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,470
You guys have a beast?

1394
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:18,977
No, there's no beast. He's just being stupid.

1395
01:27:19,317 --> 01:27:20,683
We're going to start a revolution.

1396
01:27:20,777 --> 01:27:22,234
- Revolution? - I'll explain later.

1397
01:27:22,821 --> 01:27:24,983
- Who's this guy again? - I'll explain later.

1398
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:28,316
Is that some sort of protoplasm,

1399
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:29,526
all the stuff that's coming out of you...

1400
01:27:29,703 --> 01:27:30,864
or are they eggs?

1401
01:27:32,372 --> 01:27:33,488
Looks like eggs.

1402
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:36,957
Oh!

1403
01:27:43,049 --> 01:27:44,256
I'm looking for Korg.

1404
01:27:44,634 --> 01:27:45,795
Who's asking?

1405
01:27:46,052 --> 01:27:47,133
I know you're asking.

1406
01:27:47,429 --> 01:27:49,295
Is anyone else asking, or is it just you?

1407
01:27:49,639 --> 01:27:51,596
The Lord of Thunder sends his best.

1408
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:57,262
The revolution has begun.

1409
01:27:57,606 --> 01:27:59,518
Revolution? How did this happen?

1410
01:27:59,816 --> 01:28:01,227
Don't know.

1411
01:28:01,526 --> 01:28:02,892
But the arena's mainframe

1412
01:28:02,986 --> 01:28:04,568
for the Obedience Disks have been deactivated...

1413
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:06,733
and the slaves have armed themselves.

1414
01:28:06,907 --> 01:28:08,864
Oh. I don't like that word.

1415
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:10,324
Which? Mainframe?

1416
01:28:10,577 --> 01:28:12,569
No. Why would I not like "mainframe"?

1417
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:14,786
No, the "S" word.

1418
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:17,578
Sorry, the prisoners with jobs have armed themselves.

1419
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:20,334
Okay, that's better.

1420
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:28,342
Hey, so, listen. We should talk.

1421
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:30,841
I disagree.

1422
01:28:31,348 --> 01:28:34,136
Open communication was never our family's forte.

1423
01:28:34,518 --> 01:28:35,508
You have no idea.

1424
01:28:35,685 --> 01:28:38,268
Been quite the revelation since we last spoke.

1425
01:28:38,355 --> 01:28:39,345
Hello.

1426
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:41,430
Hi.

1427
01:28:48,532 --> 01:28:50,068
Odin brought us together.

1428
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:53,947
It's almost poetic that his death should split us apart.

1429
01:29:00,085 --> 01:29:02,077
We might as well be strangers now.

1430
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:05,296
Two sons of the crown, set adrift.

1431
01:29:05,632 --> 01:29:07,544
Oh.

1432
01:29:08,552 --> 01:29:09,963
Thought you didn't wanna talk about it.

1433
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:12,461
Here's the thing.

1434
01:29:12,848 --> 01:29:14,510
I'm probably better off staying here on Sakaar.

1435
01:29:14,724 --> 01:29:16,340
That's exactly what I was thinking.

1436
01:29:18,395 --> 01:29:19,681
Did you just agree with me?

1437
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:21,437
Come on, this place is perfect for you.

1438
01:29:21,731 --> 01:29:23,313
It's savage, chaotic, lawless...

1439
01:29:23,525 --> 01:29:25,107
Brother, you're gonna do great here.

1440
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,942
Do you truly think so little of me?

1441
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:30,813
Loki, I thought the world of you.

1442
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:34,491
I thought we were gonna fight side by side forever.

1443
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:37,494
But at the end of the day, you're you and I'm me.

1444
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:40,657
I don't know, maybe there's still good in you.

1445
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:42,078
But let's be honest,

1446
01:29:42,168 --> 01:29:44,330
our paths diverged a long time ago.

1447
01:29:49,134 --> 01:29:50,124
Yeah.

1448
01:29:51,344 --> 01:29:52,380
It's probably for the best

1449
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:53,586
that we never see each other again.

1450
01:29:53,889 --> 01:29:54,970
That's what you always wanted.

1451
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:00,976
Hey, let's do "Get Help."

1452
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:02,219
- What? - "Get Help."

1453
01:30:02,314 --> 01:30:03,304
No.

1454
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:04,388
- Come on, you love it. - I hate it.

1455
01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:05,472
It's great. It works every time.

1456
01:30:05,567 --> 01:30:07,183
- It's humiliating. - Do you have a better plan?

1457
01:30:07,277 --> 01:30:08,813
- No. - We're doing it.

1458
01:30:08,987 --> 01:30:10,649
We are not doing "Get Help."

1459
01:30:11,281 --> 01:30:12,943
Get help! Please!

1460
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:14,189
My brother, he's dying.

1461
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:16,321
Get help! Help him!

1462
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:19,612
Classic.

1463
01:30:19,789 --> 01:30:21,121
Still hate it.

1464
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:23,575
- It's humiliating. - Not for me, it's not.

1465
01:30:23,835 --> 01:30:25,872
Now, which one's the ship she told us to get?

1466
01:30:25,962 --> 01:30:26,952
The Commodore.

1467
01:30:27,881 --> 01:30:28,871
Right.

1468
01:30:31,635 --> 01:30:34,127
Though I feel it won't make much of a difference.

1469
01:30:36,389 --> 01:30:38,051
Oh, Loki.

1470
01:30:39,309 --> 01:30:40,550
I know I've betrayed you many times before...

1471
01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:42,346
but this time it's truly nothing personal.

1472
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:44,474
The reward for your capture

1473
01:30:44,564 --> 01:30:45,645
will set me up nicely.

1474
01:30:45,941 --> 01:30:47,352
Never one for sentiment, were you?

1475
01:30:47,734 --> 01:30:48,975
Easier to let it burn.

1476
01:30:49,319 --> 01:30:50,309
I agree.

1477
01:30:58,995 --> 01:31:00,486
Oh, that looks painful.

1478
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:03,952
Oh, dear brother, you're becoming predictable.

1479
01:31:04,334 --> 01:31:06,121
I trust you, you betray me.

1480
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:08,373
Round and round in circles we go.

1481
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:10,538
See, Loki, life is about, it's about growth.

1482
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:11,956
It's about change.

1483
01:31:12,217 --> 01:31:15,176
But you seem to just wanna stay the same.

1484
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:17,507
I guess what I'm trying to say...

1485
01:31:17,764 --> 01:31:20,598
is that you'll always be the God of Mischief...

1486
01:31:20,892 --> 01:31:22,224
but you could be more.

1487
01:31:24,854 --> 01:31:26,766
I'll just put this over here for you.

1488
01:31:27,399 --> 01:31:30,733
Anyway, all got places to be, so good luck.

1489
01:31:36,199 --> 01:31:37,440
All right, I can figure this out.

1490
01:31:37,909 --> 01:31:39,650
It's just another spaceship.

1491
01:31:53,091 --> 01:31:54,377
Loyal Sakaarians...

1492
01:31:54,634 --> 01:31:56,500
Lord of Thunder has stolen my ship

1493
01:31:56,594 --> 01:31:57,960
and my favorite champion.

1494
01:31:59,597 --> 01:32:02,681
Sakaarians, take to the skies. Bring him down.

1495
01:32:02,892 --> 01:32:04,508
Do not let him leave this planet.

1496
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:18,982
- Good shot! - Thanks.

1497
01:32:22,078 --> 01:32:23,068
Open the doors.

1498
01:32:23,163 --> 01:32:24,449
Okay.

1499
01:32:29,836 --> 01:32:31,577
I hope that you're tougher than you look.

1500
01:32:31,755 --> 01:32:32,791
Why?

1501
01:32:45,351 --> 01:32:47,058
Shouldn't we be shooting back or something?

1502
01:32:47,145 --> 01:32:48,135
Yes, we should.

1503
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,221
Where are the guns on this ship?

1504
01:32:50,523 --> 01:32:51,809
There aren't any.

1505
01:32:52,067 --> 01:32:53,524
- It's a leisure vessel. - What?

1506
01:32:53,818 --> 01:32:55,309
Grandmaster uses it for his good times,

1507
01:32:55,445 --> 01:32:56,435
orgies and stuff.

1508
01:32:56,821 --> 01:32:58,107
Did she just say the Grandmaster

1509
01:32:58,198 --> 01:32:59,314
uses it for orgies?

1510
01:32:59,574 --> 01:33:00,690
Yeah.

1511
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:02,236
Don't touch anything.

1512
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:23,966
No!

1513
01:33:26,976 --> 01:33:27,966
- No! - No!

1514
01:33:34,984 --> 01:33:36,020
Get inside!

1515
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:37,730
In a minute.

1516
01:33:49,165 --> 01:33:50,997
I should probably go and help. Here, take the wheel.

1517
01:33:51,084 --> 01:33:52,450
No. I don't know how to fly one of these.

1518
01:33:52,752 --> 01:33:54,493
You're a scientist. Use one of your PhDs.

1519
01:33:54,587 --> 01:33:57,796
None of them are for flying alien spaceships!

1520
01:34:32,584 --> 01:34:33,574
Okay, come on.

1521
01:34:33,668 --> 01:34:35,705
There's gotta be a gun on this thing.

1522
01:34:35,837 --> 01:34:36,827
That looks like a gun.

1523
01:34:38,173 --> 01:34:39,459
It's my birthday

1524
01:34:39,549 --> 01:34:40,585
It's my birthday

1525
01:34:41,551 --> 01:34:42,541
It's my birthday

1526
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:51,683
Yeah!

1527
01:35:09,245 --> 01:35:11,328
Guys, we're coming up on the Devil's Anus!

1528
01:35:18,129 --> 01:35:19,119
There she is.

1529
01:35:19,422 --> 01:35:21,254
Our ticket out of here.

1530
01:35:21,925 --> 01:35:23,086
Hey, what's this?

1531
01:35:28,139 --> 01:35:29,220
Thank you.

1532
01:35:29,307 --> 01:35:31,799
Hey, man. We're about to jump on that ginormous spaceship.

1533
01:35:31,893 --> 01:35:32,883
You wanna come?

1534
01:35:33,269 --> 01:35:35,886
You do seem like

1535
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:37,471
you're in desperate need of leadership.

1536
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:39,310
Why, thank you.

1537
01:35:43,196 --> 01:35:44,186
Here we go.

1538
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:51,735
Shit.

1539
01:36:09,305 --> 01:36:11,012
Asgardians...

1540
01:36:11,266 --> 01:36:13,679
some misguided soul...

1541
01:36:14,644 --> 01:36:16,510
has stolen the Bifrost sword.

1542
01:36:16,854 --> 01:36:19,062
Tell us where it is...

1543
01:36:19,357 --> 01:36:21,849
or there will be consequences.

1544
01:36:25,697 --> 01:36:26,813
Bad ones.

1545
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:31,149
Well?

1546
01:36:38,293 --> 01:36:39,283
You.

1547
01:37:15,538 --> 01:37:19,498
Well? Executioner?

1548
01:37:24,547 --> 01:37:25,754
Wait!

1549
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:26,830
Wait!

1550
01:37:29,218 --> 01:37:30,379
I know where the sword is.

1551
01:38:13,638 --> 01:38:15,800
I never thought I'd be back here.

1552
01:38:19,477 --> 01:38:20,934
I thought it'd be a lot nicer.

1553
01:38:21,479 --> 01:38:22,936
I mean, not that it's not nice.

1554
01:38:23,022 --> 01:38:24,388
It's just, it's on fire.

1555
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:25,639
Here, up here in the mountains.

1556
01:38:26,109 --> 01:38:28,192
Heat signatures. People clustered together.

1557
01:38:28,361 --> 01:38:29,351
She's coming for them.

1558
01:38:29,654 --> 01:38:30,644
Okay, drop me off at the palace

1559
01:38:30,738 --> 01:38:32,855
- and I'll draw her away. - And get yourself killed?

1560
01:38:33,074 --> 01:38:34,736
The people trapped down there are all that matters.

1561
01:38:34,826 --> 01:38:36,158
While I'm dealing with Hela, I need you two

1562
01:38:36,244 --> 01:38:37,325
to help get everyone off Asgard.

1563
01:38:37,787 --> 01:38:39,403
How the hell are we supposed to do that?

1564
01:38:40,081 --> 01:38:41,617
I have a man on the ground.

1565
01:38:47,505 --> 01:38:48,495
Asgard.

1566
01:38:52,135 --> 01:38:53,296
She's here.

1567
01:39:05,022 --> 01:39:06,604
Now the ship has a gun.

1568
01:39:06,858 --> 01:39:07,939
I'll take it from here.

1569
01:39:08,901 --> 01:39:11,769
I found this in the armory.

1570
01:39:15,158 --> 01:39:16,148
Good luck.

1571
01:39:17,869 --> 01:39:19,030
Your Majesty...

1572
01:39:21,122 --> 01:39:22,158
don't die.

1573
01:39:25,168 --> 01:39:26,784
You know what I mean.

1574
01:40:25,853 --> 01:40:27,594
We must keep moving!

1575
01:40:28,397 --> 01:40:29,979
Go to the Bifrost!

1576
01:41:12,775 --> 01:41:13,856
Sister.

1577
01:41:16,153 --> 01:41:17,769
You're still alive.

1578
01:41:18,072 --> 01:41:19,938
I love what you've done with the place.

1579
01:41:20,032 --> 01:41:21,364
Redecorating, I see.

1580
01:41:21,742 --> 01:41:23,779
It seems our father's solution

1581
01:41:23,869 --> 01:41:26,327
to every problem was to cover it up.

1582
01:41:27,957 --> 01:41:29,448
Or to cast it out.

1583
01:41:31,794 --> 01:41:35,208
He told you you were worthy. He said the same thing to me.

1584
01:41:35,923 --> 01:41:37,164
You see?

1585
01:41:37,925 --> 01:41:39,962
You never knew him.

1586
01:41:40,386 --> 01:41:42,127
Not at his best.

1587
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:45,298
Odin and I drowned entire civilizations

1588
01:41:45,391 --> 01:41:46,882
in blood and tears.

1589
01:41:47,184 --> 01:41:49,972
Where do you think all this gold came from?

1590
01:41:50,271 --> 01:41:51,853
And then, one day...

1591
01:41:52,148 --> 01:41:55,016
he decided to become a benevolent king.

1592
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:57,851
To foster peace, to protect life...

1593
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:00,570
to have you.

1594
01:42:01,115 --> 01:42:03,402
I understand why you're angry.

1595
01:42:03,659 --> 01:42:05,116
And you are my sister, and technically

1596
01:42:05,202 --> 01:42:07,489
have a claim to the throne.

1597
01:42:07,747 --> 01:42:09,659
And believe me, I would love for someone else to rule.

1598
01:42:09,749 --> 01:42:10,865
But it can't be you.

1599
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:14,618
You're just... The worst.

1600
01:42:16,297 --> 01:42:17,833
Okay, get up.

1601
01:42:18,215 --> 01:42:20,081
You're in my seat.

1602
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:23,126
You know, Father once told me...

1603
01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:25,845
that a wise king never seeks out war.

1604
01:42:26,098 --> 01:42:28,511
But must always be ready for it.

1605
01:43:00,925 --> 01:43:02,166
Go back!

1606
01:43:07,348 --> 01:43:08,589
Go!

1607
01:43:43,759 --> 01:43:46,126
To be honest, I expected more.

1608
01:43:49,390 --> 01:43:50,380
Heimdall!

1609
01:43:52,727 --> 01:43:54,343
The sword!

1610
01:43:58,941 --> 01:44:00,398
Here's the difference between us.

1611
01:44:00,735 --> 01:44:02,192
I'm Odin's firstborn...

1612
01:44:02,445 --> 01:44:04,732
the rightful heir, the savior of Asgard.

1613
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:06,737
And you're nothing.

1614
01:44:17,001 --> 01:44:19,789
So simple, even a blind man could see it.

1615
01:44:22,089 --> 01:44:23,079
Oh.

1616
01:44:23,632 --> 01:44:25,749
Now you remind me of Dad.

1617
01:44:36,145 --> 01:44:37,807
The stupid dog won't die!

1618
01:44:59,919 --> 01:45:02,627
Everything's gonna be all right now. I got this.

1619
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:05,087
You wanted to know who I am?

1620
01:45:06,175 --> 01:45:07,666
What the hell are you talking about?

1621
01:45:07,968 --> 01:45:09,254
You'll see!

1622
01:45:58,018 --> 01:46:00,135
You see? No one's going anywhere.

1623
01:46:00,437 --> 01:46:01,723
I'll get that sword...

1624
01:46:01,897 --> 01:46:04,514
even if I have to kill every single one of them to do it.

1625
01:46:31,343 --> 01:46:32,584
Hey, man.

1626
01:46:33,888 --> 01:46:35,129
I'm Korg. This is Miek.

1627
01:46:35,389 --> 01:46:36,505
We're gonna jump on that spaceship

1628
01:46:36,599 --> 01:46:37,680
and get out of here. Wanna come?

1629
01:46:47,318 --> 01:46:51,062
Your savior is here.

1630
01:46:58,704 --> 01:47:00,411
Did you miss me?

1631
01:47:00,748 --> 01:47:01,955
Everyone, on that ship now.

1632
01:47:06,503 --> 01:47:08,540
Welcome home. I saw you coming.

1633
01:47:08,839 --> 01:47:09,829
Of course you did.

1634
01:47:26,690 --> 01:47:28,773
It's a valiant effort, but you never stood a chance.

1635
01:47:29,944 --> 01:47:30,980
You see...

1636
01:47:31,862 --> 01:47:34,525
I'm not a queen or a monster.

1637
01:47:36,659 --> 01:47:38,195
I'm the Goddess of Death.

1638
01:47:39,453 --> 01:47:41,536
What were you the god of, again?

1639
01:47:53,175 --> 01:47:54,882
Even when you had two eyes...

1640
01:47:55,761 --> 01:47:57,468
you'd see only half the picture.

1641
01:47:59,014 --> 01:48:01,848
She's too strong. Without my hammer, I can't.

1642
01:48:03,227 --> 01:48:06,595
Are you Thor, the God of Hammers? Hmm?

1643
01:48:09,858 --> 01:48:12,145
That hammer was to help you control your power,

1644
01:48:12,236 --> 01:48:13,477
to focus it.

1645
01:48:14,405 --> 01:48:15,987
It was never your source of strength.

1646
01:48:16,907 --> 01:48:19,024
It's too late. She's already taken Asgard.

1647
01:48:20,285 --> 01:48:22,823
Asgard is not a place. Never was.

1648
01:48:24,206 --> 01:48:25,287
This could be Asgard.

1649
01:48:26,667 --> 01:48:28,659
Asgard is where our people stand.

1650
01:48:29,670 --> 01:48:34,290
Even now, right now, those people need your help.

1651
01:48:42,141 --> 01:48:44,133
I'm not as strong as you.

1652
01:48:47,021 --> 01:48:48,011
No...

1653
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:50,681
you're stronger.

1654
01:48:59,825 --> 01:49:01,066
Tell me, brother.

1655
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:03,493
What were you the god of again?

1656
01:51:19,173 --> 01:51:21,210
- You're late. - You're missing an eye.

1657
01:51:21,550 --> 01:51:22,882
This isn't over.

1658
01:51:30,142 --> 01:51:31,758
I think we should disband the Revengers.

1659
01:51:33,437 --> 01:51:34,473
Hit her with a lightning blast.

1660
01:51:34,771 --> 01:51:35,887
I just hit her with the biggest lightning blast

1661
01:51:35,981 --> 01:51:37,097
in the history of lightning.

1662
01:51:37,191 --> 01:51:38,181
It did nothing.

1663
01:51:41,987 --> 01:51:44,479
We just need to hold her off until everyone's on board.

1664
01:51:45,282 --> 01:51:46,648
It won't end there.

1665
01:51:47,117 --> 01:51:50,360
The longer Hela's on Asgard, the more powerful she grows.

1666
01:51:50,704 --> 01:51:52,286
She'll hunt us down.

1667
01:51:52,497 --> 01:51:53,908
We need to stop her here and now.

1668
01:51:54,208 --> 01:51:55,244
So what do we do?

1669
01:51:56,251 --> 01:51:57,583
I'm not doing "Get Help."

1670
01:52:09,973 --> 01:52:13,091
Asgard's not a place, it's a people.

1671
01:52:15,145 --> 01:52:16,135
Loki...

1672
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:18,312
this was never about stopping Ragnarok.

1673
01:52:18,649 --> 01:52:20,515
This was about causing Ragnarok.

1674
01:52:20,734 --> 01:52:22,225
Surtur's crown, the vault.

1675
01:52:24,112 --> 01:52:25,319
It's the only way.

1676
01:52:26,031 --> 01:52:27,363
Bold move, brother.

1677
01:52:28,784 --> 01:52:30,116
Even for me.

1678
01:52:33,413 --> 01:52:34,403
Shall we?

1679
01:52:35,582 --> 01:52:36,572
After you.

1680
01:53:02,276 --> 01:53:03,608
This is madness.

1681
01:53:17,165 --> 01:53:18,656
Go! Go, now!

1682
01:54:19,936 --> 01:54:21,222
For Asgard.

1683
01:54:35,660 --> 01:54:36,867
Hela!

1684
01:55:01,603 --> 01:55:05,597
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.

1685
01:55:16,868 --> 01:55:18,359
Hela, enough!

1686
01:55:22,207 --> 01:55:24,824
You want Asgard, it's yours.

1687
01:55:25,335 --> 01:55:28,544
Whatever game you're playing, it won't work.

1688
01:55:28,797 --> 01:55:30,208
You can't defeat me.

1689
01:55:31,091 --> 01:55:32,332
No, I know.

1690
01:55:34,052 --> 01:55:35,042
But he can.

1691
01:55:39,558 --> 01:55:40,639
No.

1692
01:55:48,733 --> 01:55:52,022
Tremble before me, Asgard!

1693
01:55:52,279 --> 01:55:54,396
I am your reckoning!

1694
01:56:03,915 --> 01:56:05,326
The people are safe.

1695
01:56:06,084 --> 01:56:07,746
That's all that matters.

1696
01:56:09,671 --> 01:56:10,878
We're fulfilling the prophecy.

1697
01:56:11,631 --> 01:56:12,872
I hate this prophecy.

1698
01:56:13,175 --> 01:56:14,837
So do I, but we have no choice.

1699
01:56:15,135 --> 01:56:16,797
Surtur destroys Asgard...

1700
01:56:17,095 --> 01:56:19,303
he destroys Hela, so that our people may live.

1701
01:56:19,431 --> 01:56:21,013
But we need to let him finish the job,

1702
01:56:21,099 --> 01:56:22,180
otherwise...

1703
01:56:23,935 --> 01:56:24,925
No!

1704
01:56:27,439 --> 01:56:29,271
Hulk, stop, you moron!

1705
01:56:38,492 --> 01:56:39,528
Hulk, stop.

1706
01:56:39,784 --> 01:56:42,618
Just for once in your life, don't smash.

1707
01:56:43,997 --> 01:56:45,579
Big monster!

1708
01:56:46,041 --> 01:56:47,122
Let's go!

1709
01:56:49,002 --> 01:56:49,992
Fine.

1710
01:57:14,194 --> 01:57:16,857
I am Asgard's doom!

1711
01:57:40,053 --> 01:57:42,010
The damage is not too bad.

1712
01:57:42,305 --> 01:57:44,171
As long as the foundations are still strong...

1713
01:57:44,474 --> 01:57:45,806
we can rebuild this place.

1714
01:57:46,268 --> 01:57:48,351
It will become a haven...

1715
01:57:48,645 --> 01:57:51,353
for all peoples and aliens of the universe.

1716
01:57:58,405 --> 01:58:00,738
Now those foundations are gone. Sorry.

1717
01:58:15,964 --> 01:58:17,751
What have I done?

1718
01:58:19,050 --> 01:58:21,337
You saved us from extinction.

1719
01:58:21,636 --> 01:58:23,218
Asgard is not a place...

1720
01:58:25,015 --> 01:58:26,551
it's a people.

1721
01:58:55,879 --> 01:58:57,290
It suits you.

1722
01:59:00,175 --> 01:59:02,508
Maybe you're not so bad after all, brother.

1723
01:59:02,969 --> 01:59:04,005
Maybe not.

1724
01:59:05,472 --> 01:59:06,508
Thank you.

1725
01:59:07,432 --> 01:59:09,594
If you were here, I might even give you a hug.

1726
01:59:14,105 --> 01:59:15,266
I'm here.

1727
01:59:39,506 --> 01:59:40,747
Your throne.

1728
01:59:56,064 --> 01:59:58,977
So. King of Asgard.

1729
02:00:09,661 --> 02:00:10,651
Where to?

1730
02:00:11,913 --> 02:00:13,154
I'm not sure.

1731
02:00:13,915 --> 02:00:14,996
Any suggestions?

1732
02:00:17,877 --> 02:00:19,584
Miek, where are you from?

1733
02:00:19,963 --> 02:00:21,750
Oh, Miek's dead.

1734
02:00:22,048 --> 02:00:25,041
Yeah, no, I accidentally stomped on him on the bridge.

1735
02:00:25,218 --> 02:00:26,550
I've just felt so guilty,

1736
02:00:26,636 --> 02:00:27,797
I've been carrying him around all day.

1737
02:00:29,973 --> 02:00:31,885
Miek, you're alive!

1738
02:00:31,975 --> 02:00:33,136
He's alive, guys.

1739
02:00:33,226 --> 02:00:34,387
What was your question again, bro?

1740
02:00:36,229 --> 02:00:37,219
Earth it is.

1741
02:02:53,992 --> 02:02:55,403
Do you really think it's a good idea

1742
02:02:55,493 --> 02:02:56,574
to go back to Earth?

1743
02:02:57,161 --> 02:02:58,151
Yes, of course.

1744
02:02:58,246 --> 02:03:00,329
The people of Earth love me. I'm very popular.

1745
02:03:00,874 --> 02:03:02,661
Let me rephrase that.

1746
02:03:03,042 --> 02:03:04,829
Do you really think it's a good idea

1747
02:03:04,919 --> 02:03:06,285
to bring me back to Earth?

1748
02:03:06,963 --> 02:03:08,920
Probably not, to be honest.

1749
02:03:09,007 --> 02:03:10,714
I wouldn't worry, brother.

1750
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:13,793
I feel like everything's gonna work out fine.

1751
02:09:42,900 --> 02:09:43,890
Oh, boy.

1752
02:09:50,491 --> 02:09:52,198
Oh.

1753
02:09:52,285 --> 02:09:56,279
I just gotta say, I'm proud of you all.

1754
02:09:56,706 --> 02:09:59,915
This revolution has been a huge success. Yay, us!

1755
02:10:00,293 --> 02:10:02,660
Pat on the back. Pat on the back.

1756
02:10:02,753 --> 02:10:04,995
Come on. No?

1757
02:10:05,548 --> 02:10:07,540
Me too. 'Cause I've been a big part of it.

1758
02:10:07,633 --> 02:10:10,421
Can't have a revolution without somebody to overthrow.

1759
02:10:10,511 --> 02:10:12,377
So, you're welcome.

1760
02:10:12,680 --> 02:10:14,922
And, uh, it's a tie.
