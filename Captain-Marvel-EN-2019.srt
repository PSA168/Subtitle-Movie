1
00:02:15,644 --> 00:02:16,644
Do you know what time it is?

2
00:02:17,212 --> 00:02:18,245
Can't sleep.

3
00:02:18,547 --> 00:02:19,847
There are tabs for that.

4
00:02:20,976 --> 00:02:22,478
Yeah, but then I'd be sleeping.

5
00:02:23,212 --> 00:02:24,346
Dreams again?

6
00:02:29,184 --> 00:02:30,219
Wanna fight?

7
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:35,155
I slipped.

8
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:36,223
Alright, you slipped

9
00:02:36,225 --> 00:02:38,225
as a result of me
punching you in the face.

10
00:02:38,227 --> 00:02:40,393
I was already slipping when you
happened to punch me in the face.

11
00:02:40,395 --> 00:02:41,596
The two events were not related.

12
00:02:42,564 --> 00:02:43,665
Tell me about this dream.

13
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:47,253
Anything new?

14
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,200
No.

15
00:02:53,074 --> 00:02:54,574
You have to let go of the past.

16
00:02:54,676 --> 00:02:55,842
I don't remember my past.

17
00:02:55,844 --> 00:02:57,111
It's causing you doubt,

18
00:02:57,513 --> 00:02:59,214
and doubt makes you vulnerable.

19
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:08,524
Control it.

20
00:03:10,392 --> 00:03:12,392
Lose control again,
and you'll have to commune

21
00:03:12,394 --> 00:03:13,860
with the Supreme Intelligence.

22
00:03:13,862 --> 00:03:16,732
There's nothing more dangerous
to a warrior than emotion.

23
00:03:19,835 --> 00:03:22,036
Humor is a distraction.

24
00:03:24,473 --> 00:03:25,539
And anger?

25
00:03:25,941 --> 00:03:27,376
Anger only serves the enemy.

26
00:03:38,754 --> 00:03:41,856
<i>One hundred twenty days
since the last Skrull attack.</i>

27
00:03:42,558 --> 00:03:43,890
Has anyone ever seen

28
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,625
what the Supreme Intelligence
really looks like?

29
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:48,495
No one can look upon
the Supreme Intelligence

30
00:03:48,497 --> 00:03:49,765
in its true form.

31
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:51,766
You know that.

32
00:03:52,868 --> 00:03:55,402
Our subconscious chooses
the way they appear to us.

33
00:03:55,604 --> 00:03:56,802
So it's sacred.

34
00:03:57,703 --> 00:03:58,738
It's personal.

35
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,874
No Kree divulges it, ever.

36
00:04:01,276 --> 00:04:02,277
Who do you see?

37
00:04:03,312 --> 00:04:04,344
Your brother?
No.

38
00:04:04,446 --> 00:04:05,712
Father?
No.

39
00:04:05,714 --> 00:04:06,784
Your old commander?

40
00:04:07,085 --> 00:04:07,985
Vers.

41
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,284
It's me you see, isn't it?

42
00:04:10,619 --> 00:04:12,085
I see what you're trying to do.

43
00:04:12,287 --> 00:04:13,653
Is it working?
Yes.

44
00:04:13,755 --> 00:04:15,622
But you won't succeed
in changing the subject.

45
00:04:15,624 --> 00:04:18,224
What is the point of giving me these...

46
00:04:18,226 --> 00:04:19,826
if you don't want me to use them?

47
00:04:19,928 --> 00:04:21,295
I want you to use them.

48
00:04:21,797 --> 00:04:23,697
The Supreme Intelligence
gave me a responsibility

49
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:25,966
of showing you how to use them.

50
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:26,733
I know how.

51
00:04:26,735 --> 00:04:27,543
Yeah, if that were true,

52
00:04:27,544 --> 00:04:28,937
you'd be able to knock me
down without them.

53
00:04:30,472 --> 00:04:32,241
Control your impulses.

54
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:35,976
Stop using this, start using this.

55
00:04:36,778 --> 00:04:38,107
I want you...

56
00:04:39,008 --> 00:04:40,882
to be the best version of yourself.

57
00:05:21,823 --> 00:05:23,157
<i>Vers.</i>

58
00:05:23,925 --> 00:05:25,325
Intelligence.

59
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:28,895
<i>Your commander insists
that you're fit to serve.</i>

60
00:05:28,997 --> 00:05:30,264
I am.

61
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,567
<i>You struggle with your emotions,</i>

62
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:36,638
<i>with your past which fuels them.</i>

63
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,574
<i>You are just one victim
of the Skrull expansion,</i>

64
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:44,578
<i>that has threatened our
civilization for centuries.</i>

65
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,747
<i>Imposters who silently infiltrate,</i>

66
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:49,751
<i>then take over our planets.</i>

67
00:05:51,687 --> 00:05:53,553
<i>Horrors that you remember,</i>

68
00:05:53,555 --> 00:05:56,191
<i>and so much that you do not.</i>

69
00:05:59,761 --> 00:06:01,731
It's all blank.

70
00:06:02,132 --> 00:06:03,196
My life.

71
00:06:03,598 --> 00:06:06,466
You're supposed to take the form
of who I most admire.

72
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,632
But I don't even remember...

73
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:11,036
who this person was to me.

74
00:06:11,606 --> 00:06:13,173
<i>Perhaps this is a mercy,</i>

75
00:06:13,675 --> 00:06:15,709
<i>sparing you from a deeper pain.</i>

76
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:19,313
<i>Freeing you to do what all Kree must,</i>

77
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,561
<i>put your people's needs
before your own.</i>

78
00:06:23,018 --> 00:06:25,052
<i>We've given you a great gift.</i>

79
00:06:25,254 --> 00:06:27,889
<i>The chance to fight
for the good of all Kree.</i>

80
00:06:29,558 --> 00:06:30,758
I want to serve.

81
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,292
<i>Then master yourself.</i>

82
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:35,064
<i>What was given can be taken away.</i>

83
00:06:39,868 --> 00:06:41,034
I won't let you down.

84
00:06:41,036 --> 00:06:42,771
<i>We'll know soon enough.</i>

85
00:06:43,772 --> 00:06:45,240
<i>You have a mission.</i>

86
00:06:46,675 --> 00:06:49,010
<i>Serve well and with honor.</i>

87
00:07:09,965 --> 00:07:11,431
This can't be good.

88
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:13,466
Must be another Skrull attack.

89
00:07:13,668 --> 00:07:15,003
Whatever it is, it's big.

90
00:07:16,037 --> 00:07:17,537
Has a Skrull ever simmed you?

91
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:18,605
Once.

92
00:07:18,707 --> 00:07:20,333
It was deeply disturbing.

93
00:07:20,334 --> 00:07:20,874
Why?

94
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,476
Because I stared into
the face of my mortal enemy,

95
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:25,412
and the face staring back was my own.

96
00:07:25,413 --> 00:07:28,248
Maybe if you were more attractive,
then it would be less disturbing.

97
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,797
You think you're funny,

98
00:07:29,798 --> 00:07:30,851
but I'm not laughing.

99
00:07:30,852 --> 00:07:31,885
You never laugh.

100
00:07:31,887 --> 00:07:34,254
I laugh on the inside.

101
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:36,356
I'm not doing that now.

102
00:07:36,358 --> 00:07:37,524
It's funny because, objectively speaking,

103
00:07:37,526 --> 00:07:38,725
you're quite handsome.

104
00:07:38,727 --> 00:07:39,826
Well, thank you.

105
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:40,642
Listen up, team.

106
00:07:40,643 --> 00:07:41,829
Knock it off.

107
00:07:42,531 --> 00:07:43,531
Alright.

108
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:45,833
Prepare for...

109
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:50,370
a search and rescue
of our spy, Soh-Larr.

110
00:07:50,372 --> 00:07:53,340
The Skrulls have invaded
yet another border planet.

111
00:07:53,341 --> 00:07:54,908
This time, Torfa.

112
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,945
Soh-Larr sent us a warning,
the signal was intercepted,

113
00:07:58,346 --> 00:07:59,744
and his cover's blown.

114
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:05,051
The Skrull general Talos
has sent kill units to find him.

115
00:08:05,453 --> 00:08:07,020
Should they reach him before we do,

116
00:08:07,022 --> 00:08:10,091
the intelligence he's acquired
over three years is as good as theirs.

117
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:14,928
The Accusers will bomb
a Skrull stronghold here in the south.

118
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,102
We slip in,

119
00:08:16,303 --> 00:08:17,898
we locate Soh-Larr...

120
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,448
and we get out.

121
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,234
Leaving them none the wiser.

122
00:08:21,636 --> 00:08:23,003
The Torfan populace.

123
00:08:23,905 --> 00:08:26,206
We are not to interfere with them,
nor them with us.

124
00:08:26,207 --> 00:08:29,943
Nothing compromises
the security of our mission.

125
00:08:30,045 --> 00:08:31,645
Proceed with caution.

126
00:08:31,947 --> 00:08:33,915
Follow protocol before extracting him.

127
00:08:35,851 --> 00:08:37,484
This is a dangerous mission.

128
00:08:37,586 --> 00:08:39,720
We must all be ready
to join the Collective,

129
00:08:40,322 --> 00:08:41,788
if that is our fate today.

130
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,122
For the good of all Kree.

131
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:44,525
For the good of all Kree!

132
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:56,563
Vers, track Soh-Larr's beacon.

133
00:09:57,065 --> 00:09:59,268
Att-Lass, Minn-Erva, find elevation.

134
00:10:18,753 --> 00:10:20,055
Locals on the periphery.

135
00:10:20,956 --> 00:10:22,355
Maybe a dozen.

136
00:10:22,557 --> 00:10:23,690
Minn-Erva?

137
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:26,586
Do you read me?

138
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:27,929
Anybody copy?

139
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:29,964
Repeat.

140
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:44,947
His beacon's coming from that temple.

141
00:10:45,248 --> 00:10:46,248
Let's move.
No.

142
00:10:46,498 --> 00:10:48,348
This is a perfect spot for an ambush.

143
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,284
Only one way in, only one way out.

144
00:10:50,285 --> 00:10:51,618
We can get past the locals.

145
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:53,031
We don't know if they are locals.

146
00:10:53,832 --> 00:10:54,355
Too risky.

147
00:10:54,356 --> 00:10:55,622
You don't have to go with me,
I'll go alone.

148
00:10:55,623 --> 00:10:56,725
No, you won't.

149
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,463
Right. We keep a close radius.

150
00:11:03,865 --> 00:11:05,700
We lose comms,
we meet back at the Helion.

151
00:11:06,968 --> 00:11:07,968
Come on.

152
00:11:20,316 --> 00:11:21,948
Att-Lass, you getting this?

153
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,152
Copy. I see them.

154
00:11:33,362 --> 00:11:34,429
Get back!

155
00:11:35,197 --> 00:11:36,198
Commander?

156
00:11:43,838 --> 00:11:45,606
Get back! Back!

157
00:11:46,808 --> 00:11:48,877
Minn-Erva?
Do you have eyes on this?

158
00:11:50,678 --> 00:11:52,212
Keep them back.
Minn-Erva?

159
00:11:52,814 --> 00:11:54,116
Does anybody copy?

160
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,988
I don't wanna hurt you.

161
00:12:02,757 --> 00:12:03,757
Keep back!

162
00:12:07,229 --> 00:12:08,230
Stay back!

163
00:12:12,368 --> 00:12:14,399
They're locals. I found two dead.

164
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,001
No green.

165
00:12:15,303 --> 00:12:16,404
They're just starving.

166
00:12:42,164 --> 00:12:43,796
HGX-78.

167
00:12:43,898 --> 00:12:46,701
TRT79-VVX6.

168
00:12:49,205 --> 00:12:50,806
Get back.

169
00:12:59,348 --> 00:13:00,349
Skrulls!

170
00:13:18,099 --> 00:13:19,233
Vers!

171
00:13:19,235 --> 00:13:21,435
<i>Vers? Skrulls.</i>

172
00:13:21,437 --> 00:13:23,105
<i>It's an ambush.</i>

173
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,325
Incoming!

174
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,130
Back to the Helion.

175
00:13:50,332 --> 00:13:51,866
<i>Vers. Do you copy?</i>

176
00:13:52,268 --> 00:13:53,768
<i>Back to the Helion.</i>

177
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,502
<i>Come in. Vers.</i>

178
00:13:55,504 --> 00:13:57,737
How did you know, the code?

179
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,276
How about I tell you my secret...

180
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,813
when you've told me yours?

181
00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:09,351
<i>Let's open her up.</i>

182
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,996
<i>Where are we?</i>

183
00:14:23,998 --> 00:14:25,334
<i>Stand by.</i>

184
00:14:27,203 --> 00:14:28,337
Where's your head at?

185
00:14:29,371 --> 00:14:30,579
In the clouds.

186
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,671
Where's yours?

187
00:14:31,873 --> 00:14:33,073
On my shoulders.

188
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,109
About to show these boys
how we do it.

189
00:14:35,311 --> 00:14:36,311
You ready?

190
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:38,778
Higher, further, faster, baby.
That's right.

191
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:50,058
<i>This can't be right.</i>

192
00:14:51,859 --> 00:14:53,126
<i>Go back even further.</i>

193
00:14:57,266 --> 00:14:58,688
You're going too fast!

194
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,101
You need to go slow!

195
00:15:13,582 --> 00:15:15,126
<i>Who is this person?</i>

196
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:16,250
<i>Are we in the right...?</i>

197
00:15:16,252 --> 00:15:17,384
What the hell are you thinking?

198
00:15:17,386 --> 00:15:18,418
You don't belong out here!

199
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,719
<i>I think we went back too far.</i>

200
00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:21,521
You let him drive.

201
00:15:21,523 --> 00:15:22,524
<i>Let me try something.</i>

202
00:15:25,327 --> 00:15:26,826
Give up already!

203
00:15:26,828 --> 00:15:28,330
You don't belong out here!

204
00:15:30,232 --> 00:15:32,765
You're not strong enough.

205
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:34,336
You'll kill yourself.

206
00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:41,874
They'll never let you fly.

207
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,378
<i>Am I the only one
that's confused here?</i>

208
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,013
<i>You're a decent pilot.</i>

209
00:15:46,615 --> 00:15:47,648
But you're too emotional.

210
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,616
You do know why they call it
a cockpit...

211
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:51,117
don't you?

212
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:01,228
A huge rumble throughout
the cosmos shook the moon...

213
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,831
and the sun and the stars in the sky.

214
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:06,316
And so, little Alouette...

215
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:08,034
flew up throughout the night.

216
00:16:08,236 --> 00:16:09,970
Did you see her?
It's Alouette.

217
00:16:11,906 --> 00:16:14,106
Get your butts inside, it's time to eat.

218
00:16:14,108 --> 00:16:16,076
Prepare for takeoff, Lieutenant Trouble.

219
00:16:16,378 --> 00:16:18,113
<i>Charming memory.
Hang on.</i>

220
00:16:18,946 --> 00:16:20,249
<i>I think I've got it.</i>

221
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:26,186
Goose likes you.

222
00:16:26,488 --> 00:16:28,088
She doesn't typically take to people.

223
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:29,223
Early start to your morning.

224
00:16:29,525 --> 00:16:30,956
Late night, actually.

225
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,725
I can't sleep when there is work to do.

226
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:33,927
Sound familiar?

227
00:16:33,928 --> 00:16:35,564
Flying your planes never feels like work.

228
00:16:37,433 --> 00:16:38,665
Wonderful view, isn't it?

229
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:40,367
I prefer the view from up there.

230
00:16:40,602 --> 00:16:41,902
You'll get there soon enough, Ace.

231
00:16:41,903 --> 00:16:44,138
<i>Wait! Wait, wait!
That's her. Get her back.</i>

232
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,440
<i>Stand by.</i>

233
00:16:49,545 --> 00:16:50,677
<i>Sound familiar?</i>

234
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:52,548
Wonderful view, isn't it?

235
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,483
I prefer the view from up there.

236
00:16:56,485 --> 00:16:57,655
You'll get there soon enough, Ace.

237
00:16:57,656 --> 00:16:59,822
<i>What's that on her shirt?
I couldn't read it.</i>

238
00:17:01,657 --> 00:17:03,325
Wonderful view, isn't it?

239
00:17:06,261 --> 00:17:07,812
I prefer the view from up there.

240
00:17:08,464 --> 00:17:09,941
You'll get there soon enough, Ace. <i>Focus.</i>

241
00:17:10,342 --> 00:17:12,132
Excuse me?
<i>Look down.</i>

242
00:17:12,934 --> 00:17:13,967
<i>Focus.</i>

243
00:17:14,969 --> 00:17:17,637
<i>Pegasus. Dr. Wendy Lawson.
That's her.</i>

244
00:17:17,639 --> 00:17:18,605
Do you hear that, too?

245
00:17:18,607 --> 00:17:19,942
<i>Do we have her location?</i>

246
00:17:22,344 --> 00:17:23,344
<i>Got it.</i>

247
00:17:23,911 --> 00:17:26,415
<i>Now track Lawson until
we find the energy signature.</i>

248
00:17:30,586 --> 00:17:32,054
<i>Interesting.</i>

249
00:17:34,489 --> 00:17:35,556
<i>Hold on.</i>

250
00:17:36,358 --> 00:17:38,059
<i>Go back right before this.</i>

251
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,161
<i>Go back.</i>

252
00:17:41,263 --> 00:17:42,729
That's no MiG, Lawson.
<i>This is it.</i>

253
00:17:42,731 --> 00:17:44,465
<i>Now let me see where you're headed.</i>

254
00:17:45,367 --> 00:17:47,236
<i>That's right.
Look at the coordinates.</i>

255
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,305
<i>Focus.</i>

256
00:17:51,407 --> 00:17:52,440
<i>Open, please.</i>

257
00:17:53,242 --> 00:17:54,608
<i>That's it. That's it.</i>

258
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:55,675
<i>You're almost there.</i>

259
00:17:55,677 --> 00:17:57,246
<i>You're almost there.
Don't fight it.</i>

260
00:17:59,281 --> 00:18:00,282
<i>Focus!</i>

261
00:18:02,351 --> 00:18:04,285
<i>Get her back!
Get her back now!</i>

262
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,055
<i>This doesn't make any sense.</i>

263
00:18:24,706 --> 00:18:28,676
Do we have any information
we can act on?

264
00:18:28,778 --> 00:18:31,577
Just that Lawson was
somewhere on planet C-53.

265
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,213
We're on our way.

266
00:18:33,215 --> 00:18:35,081
Then dig, dig, dig deeper.

267
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,654
Lawson is our link
to that light-speed engine!

268
00:18:40,489 --> 00:18:41,956
And everything we're after.

269
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,699
That did something.

270
00:18:52,801 --> 00:18:54,136
Try that again.

271
00:19:05,747 --> 00:19:06,848
Not yet!

272
00:19:16,391 --> 00:19:17,892
What did you do to me?

273
00:19:18,494 --> 00:19:20,460
Now we're just after a little information.

274
00:19:20,462 --> 00:19:21,962
What did you put in my head?

275
00:19:22,164 --> 00:19:23,965
Nothing that wasn't already there.

276
00:19:25,601 --> 00:19:27,067
But those aren't my memories.

277
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:29,503
Yeah, it's like a bad trip, isn't it?

278
00:19:29,705 --> 00:19:32,105
I'm not surprised
you can't keep it straight.

279
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:34,207
They really did a number on you.

280
00:19:34,409 --> 00:19:35,575
Enough of your mind games.

281
00:19:35,577 --> 00:19:37,177
What do you want?

282
00:19:39,248 --> 00:19:41,748
We're looking for the location
of a Dr. Lawson,

283
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,517
and her light-speed engine.

284
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:45,185
I don't know any Dr. Lawson.

285
00:19:45,387 --> 00:19:48,423
Really? Then why is she in your head?

286
00:20:19,821 --> 00:20:21,120
You guys wouldn't happen to know

287
00:20:21,122 --> 00:20:22,123
how these things come off, would you?

288
00:20:22,624 --> 00:20:23,624
No?

289
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:24,759
Fine.

290
00:21:56,818 --> 00:21:57,819
Hey.

291
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:04,293
<i>You do know why they call it a...</i>

292
00:22:22,511 --> 00:22:24,144
You leaving so soon?

293
00:22:24,746 --> 00:22:26,281
We're just getting to know each other.

294
00:23:49,664 --> 00:23:51,256
Vers to Starforce command,

295
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:52,567
do you read me?

296
00:23:54,936 --> 00:23:55,636
Hello?

297
00:23:56,253 --> 00:23:57,253
Do you copy?

298
00:24:26,968 --> 00:24:28,968
Hi. I'm Vers.
Kree Starforce.

299
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,305
Is this C-53?

300
00:24:32,774 --> 00:24:35,342
Do you understand me?
Is my universal translator working?

301
00:24:35,544 --> 00:24:37,611
Yeah. I understand you.

302
00:24:37,813 --> 00:24:38,813
Good.

303
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,916
Are you in charge of security
for this district?

304
00:24:42,717 --> 00:24:45,387
Sort of.
The movie theater has its own guy.

305
00:24:46,955 --> 00:24:48,857
Where can I find
communications equipment?

306
00:24:55,964 --> 00:24:56,965
Thank you.

307
00:25:30,065 --> 00:25:32,100
Track the pod.
Find the girl.

308
00:25:33,134 --> 00:25:35,537
She knows more than she knows.

309
00:25:38,006 --> 00:25:39,006
Hey.

310
00:25:40,442 --> 00:25:41,776
This one's taken.

311
00:25:52,454 --> 00:25:53,454
Come on.

312
00:25:54,055 --> 00:25:55,055
<i>Vers?</i>

313
00:25:55,224 --> 00:25:56,291
Vers?

314
00:25:57,158 --> 00:25:59,159
Verify. CTC-39.

315
00:25:59,161 --> 00:26:00,627
<i>GRXV-1600.</i>

316
00:26:00,629 --> 00:26:01,796
<i>And I'm fine, thank you for asking.</i>

317
00:26:02,898 --> 00:26:04,430
<i>Is everyone ok?
What happened?</i>

318
00:26:04,431 --> 00:26:05,899
Skrull ambush.

319
00:26:06,501 --> 00:26:07,901
I thought we'd lost you.

320
00:26:08,103 --> 00:26:09,236
Did you find Soh-Larr?

321
00:26:09,238 --> 00:26:10,437
<i>It wasn't Soh-Larr.</i>

322
00:26:10,739 --> 00:26:12,705
<i>Talos simmed him.
Even knew his code.</i>

323
00:26:12,807 --> 00:26:14,541
That's. That's impossible.

324
00:26:15,043 --> 00:26:17,043
That code was buried
in his unconscious.

325
00:26:17,045 --> 00:26:18,611
The Skrulls messed with my mind.

326
00:26:18,613 --> 00:26:19,712
The machine that they used...

327
00:26:19,714 --> 00:26:22,015
I think it's how they
extracted Soh-Larr's code.

328
00:26:22,117 --> 00:26:23,250
Vers, where are you?

329
00:26:23,252 --> 00:26:24,752
<i>I'm on planet C-53.</i>

330
00:26:25,654 --> 00:26:27,354
The Skrulls are looking for
someone named Lawson.

331
00:26:28,056 --> 00:26:29,056
<i>Who?</i>

332
00:26:29,658 --> 00:26:32,392
She's... who I see.

333
00:26:32,894 --> 00:26:33,896
<i>She's what?</i>

334
00:26:35,164 --> 00:26:36,198
<i>Vers?</i>

335
00:26:37,666 --> 00:26:38,667
Vers, what?

336
00:26:40,001 --> 00:26:41,168
She's a scientist.

337
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,503
They think that she's cracked
the code on light-speed tech.

338
00:26:43,505 --> 00:26:44,263
I have to get to her,

339
00:26:44,264 --> 00:26:46,806
<i>before they do or else they'll be able
to invade new galaxies.</i>

340
00:26:46,808 --> 00:26:48,810
No. You've been caught once already.

341
00:26:49,811 --> 00:26:51,278
How far is C-53?

342
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,081
Closest jump point is 22 hours.

343
00:26:54,683 --> 00:26:56,816
<i>Vers, hold your
position until we get there.</i>

344
00:26:56,818 --> 00:26:58,885
<i>Keep your comms online
so we can contact you.</i>

345
00:26:58,887 --> 00:27:00,853
No! What if they get a hold of it before...

346
00:27:00,855 --> 00:27:01,955
<i>We're sorry.</i>

347
00:27:01,957 --> 00:27:04,224
<i>A long-distance company
access code is required</i>

348
00:27:04,225 --> 00:27:04,656
Yon-Rogg?

349
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:06,357
Vers?

350
00:27:07,163 --> 00:27:07,962
Vers?

351
00:27:07,963 --> 00:27:09,662
<i>Please dial your call
with the access code.</i>

352
00:27:09,864 --> 00:27:10,665
Vers?

353
00:27:11,967 --> 00:27:14,401
If the Skrulls got to her,
she's compromised.

354
00:27:14,803 --> 00:27:16,305
She's stronger than you think.

355
00:27:17,672 --> 00:27:19,241
Ever been to C-53?

356
00:27:20,176 --> 00:27:21,176
Once.

357
00:27:22,077 --> 00:27:23,811
It's a real shithole.

358
00:27:34,756 --> 00:27:37,059
Hey, rookie!
Go talk to the rent-a-cop.

359
00:27:44,733 --> 00:27:45,768
Did you call this in?

360
00:28:00,915 --> 00:28:01,916
<i>Beacon activated.</i>

361
00:28:05,287 --> 00:28:06,386
Excuse me, miss.

362
00:28:06,888 --> 00:28:08,659
You know anything about a lady,

363
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,692
blowing a hole through the roof
of that Blockbuster over there?

364
00:28:12,494 --> 00:28:15,097
Witness says she was dressed
for laser tag.

365
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,967
Yeah, I think she went that way.

366
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:23,404
I'd like to ask you some questions.

367
00:28:24,206 --> 00:28:25,087
Maybe...

368
00:28:25,088 --> 00:28:27,808
give you the 411
on the late-night drop box.

369
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,410
Could I see some identification, please?

370
00:28:30,712 --> 00:28:32,212
Vers. Kree Starforce.

371
00:28:32,214 --> 00:28:34,381
We don't carry our identification
on little cards.

372
00:28:34,383 --> 00:28:35,383
Vers?

373
00:28:36,252 --> 00:28:37,786
Starforce?

374
00:28:39,621 --> 00:28:40,954
How long you plan to be in town?

375
00:28:41,056 --> 00:28:42,222
I'll be out of your hair,

376
00:28:42,224 --> 00:28:44,961
as soon as I track down the Skrulls
that are infiltrating your planet.

377
00:28:46,295 --> 00:28:47,329
Skrulls?

378
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:49,096
Shapeshifters?

379
00:28:49,198 --> 00:28:51,968
They can transform into any
life-form down to the DNA.

380
00:28:53,835 --> 00:28:55,835
Oh Boy. You guys don't have
any clue, do you?

381
00:28:56,837 --> 00:28:57,738
Hold on.

382
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,662
How do we know...

383
00:29:00,663 --> 00:29:02,442
you're not one of those...

384
00:29:03,043 --> 00:29:04,111
shapeshifters?

385
00:29:04,213 --> 00:29:06,180
Congratulations, Agent Fury.

386
00:29:06,182 --> 00:29:08,248
You have finally asked
a relevant question.

387
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,251
No! Congratulations to you,
Starforce lady.

388
00:29:11,353 --> 00:29:12,621
You're under arrest.

389
00:29:21,297 --> 00:29:22,297
Rook!

390
00:29:23,365 --> 00:29:24,666
Rook, let's roll!

391
00:29:34,343 --> 00:29:35,575
Did you see her weapon?

392
00:29:35,777 --> 00:29:36,777
I did not.

393
00:29:46,821 --> 00:29:47,922
Watch it!

394
00:30:20,422 --> 00:30:22,957
Suspect on northbound train.
In pursuit.

395
00:30:44,012 --> 00:30:45,876
Trust me, true believer.

396
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:46,814
Trust me.

397
00:30:51,753 --> 00:30:53,555
Trust me, true believer.

398
00:31:40,068 --> 00:31:41,069
Get off!

399
00:32:36,858 --> 00:32:38,460
Train's heading for a tunnel up ahead.

400
00:32:41,497 --> 00:32:43,165
Let's greet them at the station.

401
00:32:55,109 --> 00:32:57,111
<i>Mr. Fury, this is Agent Coulson.</i>

402
00:32:58,213 --> 00:33:00,048
I'm still here at the Blockbuster.

403
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:01,049
And...

404
00:33:02,318 --> 00:33:03,416
where'd everybody go?

405
00:33:04,018 --> 00:33:05,720
<i>I finished collecting evidence...</i>

406
00:34:34,243 --> 00:34:35,575
We need an ambulance!

407
00:34:35,577 --> 00:34:37,042
Someone call 911!

408
00:34:37,044 --> 00:34:38,578
Hey! You alright?

409
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,380
Oh, my gosh!
Is everyone ok?

410
00:34:40,582 --> 00:34:41,548
Anyone else see that?

411
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,346
Official S.H.I.E.L.D. activity.

412
00:34:43,647 --> 00:34:44,785
Stay back.

413
00:35:33,435 --> 00:35:34,769
Nice scuba suit.

414
00:35:40,576 --> 00:35:41,676
Lighten up, honey?

415
00:35:42,578 --> 00:35:43,846
Got a smile for me?

416
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:49,684
Freak.

417
00:36:09,304 --> 00:36:11,358
All life on Earth is carbon-based.

418
00:36:11,459 --> 00:36:12,538
Not this guy.

419
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,209
Whatever he runs on,

420
00:36:15,511 --> 00:36:16,976
it's not on the periodic table.

421
00:36:17,078 --> 00:36:19,448
You're saying he's not from around here?

422
00:36:20,549 --> 00:36:21,617
Hey, how's your eye?

423
00:36:22,618 --> 00:36:24,517
Well, I'd say fine...

424
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,322
but it can't believe what it's seeing.

425
00:36:30,124 --> 00:36:31,089
You say...

426
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,162
this thing looked like Coulson?

427
00:36:35,264 --> 00:36:36,697
Talked like him, too.

428
00:36:37,299 --> 00:36:40,100
And the woman said
that there were more?

429
00:36:40,202 --> 00:36:42,269
The word she used was infiltration.

430
00:36:42,271 --> 00:36:43,336
You believe her?

431
00:36:43,438 --> 00:36:44,739
Not till I saw this.

432
00:36:46,741 --> 00:36:47,908
What's your plan?

433
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,777
I'll find Blockbuster girl.

434
00:36:50,779 --> 00:36:52,979
I got word on a motorcycle thief,

435
00:36:53,181 --> 00:36:54,314
that fits her description.

436
00:36:55,116 --> 00:36:57,051
If she can tell us
why these lizards are here...

437
00:36:57,853 --> 00:37:00,187
maybe she can tell us
how to kick them to the curb.

438
00:37:00,289 --> 00:37:01,290
Good.

439
00:37:02,558 --> 00:37:04,040
Do it alone, though.

440
00:37:04,041 --> 00:37:05,226
We can't trust anyone.

441
00:37:06,228 --> 00:37:07,861
Not even our own men.

442
00:37:08,363 --> 00:37:09,365
Yes, sir.

443
00:37:24,712 --> 00:37:26,513
They're ugly bastards, aren't they?

444
00:37:28,215 --> 00:37:30,319
Yeah, well, he's no Brad Pitt, sir.

445
00:37:35,591 --> 00:37:37,759
Safe journey to the beyond, my friend.

446
00:37:39,895 --> 00:37:42,731
I will finish what we started.

447
00:37:51,506 --> 00:37:53,008
I wouldn't get too close there, boss.

448
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,879
No one in or out.

449
00:38:59,408 --> 00:39:00,540
What can I get you?

450
00:39:00,842 --> 00:39:02,411
Where was this photograph taken?

451
00:39:03,378 --> 00:39:04,477
An airport.

452
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:05,912
Where's Pegasus?

453
00:39:05,914 --> 00:39:07,481
That's classified.

454
00:39:07,983 --> 00:39:10,753
Not unlike the file I started on you.

455
00:39:13,388 --> 00:39:15,655
But I see you've changed
it up a bit since then.

456
00:39:15,657 --> 00:39:17,390
Grunge is a good look for you.

457
00:39:17,492 --> 00:39:19,075
Did you have a rough day,
Agent Fury?

458
00:39:19,227 --> 00:39:20,727
It was cool, you know?

459
00:39:20,729 --> 00:39:23,497
Had a space invasion, big car chase.

460
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:26,834
Got to watch an alien autopsy.

461
00:39:27,736 --> 00:39:29,269
Typical nine-to-five.

462
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,403
So you saw one?

463
00:39:30,405 --> 00:39:32,875
I was never one to believe in aliens...

464
00:39:34,342 --> 00:39:35,976
but I can't unsee that.

465
00:39:36,578 --> 00:39:39,279
This is gonna get a little awkward,
but I gotta ask.

466
00:39:39,281 --> 00:39:41,248
You think I'm one of those green things.

467
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:42,916
Can't be too careful.

468
00:39:43,018 --> 00:39:47,787
You are looking at 100%
red-blooded Earth man.

469
00:39:47,989 --> 00:39:49,522
I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.

470
00:39:49,524 --> 00:39:51,624
We talking cheek swab or urine sample?

471
00:39:51,626 --> 00:39:53,560
No. The DNA would match.

472
00:39:53,562 --> 00:39:54,661
Want my AOL password?

473
00:39:54,763 --> 00:39:58,200
Skrulls can only sim recent memories
of their host bodies.

474
00:39:59,968 --> 00:40:01,301
You wanna get personal.

475
00:40:01,903 --> 00:40:03,803
Where were you born?
Huntsville, Alabama.

476
00:40:03,805 --> 00:40:05,438
But technically,
I don't remember that part.

477
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,906
Name of your first pet?
Mr. Snoofers.

478
00:40:06,908 --> 00:40:08,408
Mr. Snoofers?
That's what I said.

479
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,777
Do I pass?
Not yet. First job?

480
00:40:10,879 --> 00:40:12,746
Soldier. Straight out of high school.

481
00:40:12,748 --> 00:40:14,013
Left the ranks a full bird colonel.

482
00:40:14,015 --> 00:40:15,081
Then?
Spy.

483
00:40:15,383 --> 00:40:16,516
Where?
It was the Cold War.

484
00:40:16,518 --> 00:40:17,651
We were everywhere.

485
00:40:17,753 --> 00:40:20,620
Belfast. Bucharest.
Belgrade. Budapest.

486
00:40:20,622 --> 00:40:22,355
I like the B's.
I can make them rhyme.

487
00:40:22,357 --> 00:40:22,869
Now?

488
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:24,570
Been riding a desk for the past six years,

489
00:40:24,571 --> 00:40:26,793
trying to figure out where our
future enemies are coming from.

490
00:40:26,795 --> 00:40:29,830
Never occurred to me
they would be coming from above.

491
00:40:30,532 --> 00:40:33,301
Name a detail so bizarre
a Skrull could never fabricate it.

492
00:40:35,637 --> 00:40:38,074
If toast is cut diagonally, I can't eat it.

493
00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:42,809
You didn't need that, did you?

494
00:40:42,811 --> 00:40:44,546
No. No, I didn't.
But I enjoyed it.

495
00:40:45,046 --> 00:40:46,480
Ok. Your turn.

496
00:40:46,882 --> 00:40:48,417
Prove you're not a Skrull.

497
00:40:57,092 --> 00:41:00,894
And how is that supposed
to prove to me you're not a Skrull?

498
00:41:01,096 --> 00:41:02,497
That's a photon blast.

499
00:41:02,731 --> 00:41:03,731
And?

500
00:41:03,932 --> 00:41:04,933
A Skrull can't do that.

501
00:41:06,034 --> 00:41:08,668
So, a full bird colonel turned
spy turned S.H.I.E.L.D. agent,

502
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,439
must have pretty high security clearance.

503
00:41:11,673 --> 00:41:12,741
Where's Pegasus?

504
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,116
Ok. The Skrulls sim alien races
to infiltrate and take over planets.

505
00:41:23,418 --> 00:41:24,916
And you're a Kree?

506
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:27,487
A race of noble warriors?

507
00:41:27,488 --> 00:41:28,404
Heroes.

508
00:41:28,405 --> 00:41:29,923
Noble warrior heroes.

509
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:31,048
So...

510
00:41:31,049 --> 00:41:33,395
what do Skrulls want with Dr. Lawson?

511
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,930
They believe that she developed,

512
00:41:36,965 --> 00:41:38,965
a light-speed engine at Pegasus.

513
00:41:38,967 --> 00:41:40,302
Light-speed engine?

514
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:44,471
Gotta admit that's not the craziest
thing I've heard today.

515
00:41:44,472 --> 00:41:45,873
Well, it's still early.

516
00:41:46,175 --> 00:41:47,341
And you, what do you want?

517
00:41:48,443 --> 00:41:50,743
To stop the Skrulls before
they become unstoppable.

518
00:41:50,945 --> 00:41:51,946
And?

519
00:41:55,884 --> 00:41:56,918
Look...

520
00:41:56,919 --> 00:41:58,752
war is a universal language.

521
00:41:59,454 --> 00:42:01,655
I know a rogue soldier when I see one.

522
00:42:02,157 --> 00:42:04,259
You got a personal stake in this.

523
00:42:14,669 --> 00:42:16,069
<i>This is government property.</i>

524
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,900
<i>Turn your vehicle around.</i>

525
00:42:18,473 --> 00:42:20,049
Nicholas Joseph Fury.

526
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:21,741
Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

527
00:42:22,043 --> 00:42:23,178
<i>Place your thumb on the pad.</i>

528
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,013
<i>One moment.</i>

529
00:42:26,715 --> 00:42:28,785
Nicholas Joseph Fury.

530
00:42:28,786 --> 00:42:29,850
You have three names?

531
00:42:30,852 --> 00:42:32,585
Everybody calls me Fury.

532
00:42:32,587 --> 00:42:34,839
Not Nicholas. Not Joseph. Not Nick.

533
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,423
Just Fury.

534
00:42:36,424 --> 00:42:37,533
What does your mom call you?

535
00:42:37,534 --> 00:42:38,091
Fury.

536
00:42:38,093 --> 00:42:39,095
What do you call her?

537
00:42:39,096 --> 00:42:39,826
Fury.

538
00:42:39,828 --> 00:42:40,894
What about your kids?

539
00:42:40,996 --> 00:42:42,929
If I have them, they'll call me Fury.

540
00:42:43,031 --> 00:42:44,064
<i>You are cleared for access.</i>

541
00:42:44,166 --> 00:42:45,167
Thank you.

542
00:43:15,197 --> 00:43:16,296
Oh, hold up.

543
00:43:16,998 --> 00:43:19,234
You look like somebody's
disaffected niece.

544
00:43:21,736 --> 00:43:22,737
Put that on.

545
00:43:24,173 --> 00:43:24,959
What is it?

546
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,106
It's the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo.

547
00:43:26,208 --> 00:43:29,008
Does, announcing your identity on clothing

548
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:30,543
help with the covert part of your job?

549
00:43:30,745 --> 00:43:32,948
Said the space soldier
who was wearing a rubber suit.

550
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,150
Lose the flannel.

551
00:43:46,228 --> 00:43:47,462
How can I help you?

552
00:43:48,264 --> 00:43:50,465
We're agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

553
00:43:52,801 --> 00:43:54,901
We're looking for a woman
named Lawson.

554
00:43:54,903 --> 00:43:57,105
A Dr. Wendy Lawson.

555
00:43:58,740 --> 00:43:59,841
Do you know her?

556
00:44:04,579 --> 00:44:05,580
Follow me.

557
00:44:10,085 --> 00:44:12,988
You familiar with the phrase
welcome wagon?

558
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:15,290
No.

559
00:44:16,725 --> 00:44:17,960
Well, this ain't it.

560
00:44:26,202 --> 00:44:27,500
Is that a communicator?

561
00:44:27,602 --> 00:44:30,570
Yeah. State-of-the-art two-way pager.

562
00:44:30,972 --> 00:44:32,172
Who are you paging?

563
00:44:32,274 --> 00:44:35,210
My mom. Don't worry.
I didn't mention you.

564
00:45:14,616 --> 00:45:15,648
After you.

565
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:16,784
Impressive.

566
00:45:17,386 --> 00:45:19,855
Oh, you should see what
I can do with a paperclip.

567
00:45:30,865 --> 00:45:33,134
Hey, there. How are you?

568
00:45:35,003 --> 00:45:38,004
Oh, my goodness. Look at you.
Just look at you.

569
00:45:38,006 --> 00:45:40,606
Aren't you the cutest little thing?

570
00:45:40,607 --> 00:45:42,775
Aren't you cute?
And what's your name?

571
00:45:42,877 --> 00:45:44,010
What's your name?

572
00:45:44,012 --> 00:45:45,043
Goose.

573
00:45:45,044 --> 00:45:46,913
Cool name for a cool cat.

574
00:45:46,915 --> 00:45:47,916
Fury?

575
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,454
I'll be back.

576
00:45:56,624 --> 00:45:58,092
Let me get my fingerprint out.

577
00:45:58,294 --> 00:45:59,861
Just let me unravel this puppy.

578
00:46:04,099 --> 00:46:06,599
You sat there and watched me
play with tape?

579
00:46:06,668 --> 00:46:07,800
When all you had to do was...

580
00:46:07,802 --> 00:46:09,105
I didn't wanna steal your thunder.

581
00:46:27,088 --> 00:46:28,088
Lawson.

582
00:46:38,367 --> 00:46:41,303
Lawson's plan for the light-speed engine.

583
00:46:42,971 --> 00:46:44,638
I wonder why they terminated
the project.

584
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,043
Maybe because she's...

585
00:46:48,944 --> 00:46:49,944
cuckoo.

586
00:46:52,113 --> 00:46:53,249
Kree glyphs?

587
00:46:56,151 --> 00:46:57,852
Lawson is not cuckoo.

588
00:47:00,121 --> 00:47:01,154
She's Kree.

589
00:47:02,056 --> 00:47:02,408
Well...

590
00:47:03,409 --> 00:47:04,558
she's dead.

591
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:05,860
What?

592
00:47:06,427 --> 00:47:09,896
She crashed the Asis aircraft
doing an unauthorized test flight.

593
00:47:09,998 --> 00:47:11,598
Took a pilot down with her.

594
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,268
That's why security here is so unfriendly.

595
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:17,006
They're covering up
a billion-dollar mistake.

596
00:47:19,073 --> 00:47:20,484
And your light-speed engine,

597
00:47:20,785 --> 00:47:21,785
is toast.

598
00:47:25,281 --> 00:47:26,681
When did this crash happen?

599
00:47:27,516 --> 00:47:29,752
Six years ago. 1989.

600
00:47:31,886 --> 00:47:33,086
Who was the pilot?

601
00:47:34,088 --> 00:47:37,357
Most of this thing's redacted but...

602
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:41,427
there is a testimonial here
from a Maria Rambeau.

603
00:47:41,829 --> 00:47:43,565
Last person to see them alive.

604
00:47:49,137 --> 00:47:50,172
You ok?

605
00:47:54,909 --> 00:47:56,044
Back in a minute.

606
00:48:26,208 --> 00:48:28,142
This isn't about fighting wars.

607
00:48:28,444 --> 00:48:30,044
It's about ending them.

608
00:48:36,117 --> 00:48:37,750
I know Lawson was Kree.

609
00:48:37,852 --> 00:48:40,620
She was here on C-53
and died in a plane crash.

610
00:48:40,922 --> 00:48:42,657
<i>Do you know anything about this?</i>

611
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:46,626
I just discovered a mission report
sent from C-53.

612
00:48:47,128 --> 00:48:49,660
There's only so much
I'm cleared to tell you Vers,

613
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:50,461
but...

614
00:48:54,536 --> 00:48:58,538
<i>Lawson was an undercover Kree
operative named Mar-Vell.</i>

615
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:01,842
She was working on a unique energy core.

616
00:49:02,544 --> 00:49:04,759
Experimenting with tech that apparently...

617
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,314
could help us win the war.

618
00:49:13,589 --> 00:49:14,854
She still here?

619
00:49:15,056 --> 00:49:17,157
She's cooperating with
the investigation, sir.

620
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:19,066
You men stay here.

621
00:49:19,067 --> 00:49:19,693
Yes, sir.

622
00:49:19,795 --> 00:49:21,263
I want to question her alone.

623
00:49:23,299 --> 00:49:25,134
Excellent work, Nicholas.

624
00:49:29,305 --> 00:49:31,105
Does it say anything about me?

625
00:49:31,107 --> 00:49:32,973
Anything about you?
No, of course not.

626
00:49:33,275 --> 00:49:34,106
<i>Why would it?</i>

627
00:49:34,108 --> 00:49:37,244
I found evidence that I had a life here.

628
00:49:37,546 --> 00:49:38,748
<i>On C-53?</i>

629
00:49:41,583 --> 00:49:44,584
Mar-Vell is who I see when
I visit the Supreme Intelligence.

630
00:49:44,586 --> 00:49:45,804
I knew her.

631
00:49:46,405 --> 00:49:47,954
And I knew her as Lawson.

632
00:49:48,056 --> 00:49:50,390
This sounds like Skrull simulation, Vers.

633
00:49:50,392 --> 00:49:52,359
No, it's not. Because I remember.
I was here.

634
00:49:52,361 --> 00:49:54,194
<i>Stop. Remember your training.</i>

635
00:49:54,296 --> 00:49:56,630
Know your enemy.
It could be you.

636
00:49:56,632 --> 00:49:59,801
<i>Do not let your emotions
override your judgment.</i>

637
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:03,370
She's on sublevel six.

638
00:50:03,372 --> 00:50:06,675
I'll get off on five and take the stairs
in case she makes a run for it.

639
00:50:07,977 --> 00:50:11,111
Do a pincer move like we did in Havana.

640
00:50:11,313 --> 00:50:12,158
Right.

641
00:50:13,159 --> 00:50:14,483
Like we did in Havana.

642
00:50:25,126 --> 00:50:26,327
<i>We're nearing the jump point.</i>

643
00:50:26,328 --> 00:50:27,995
<i>Leave your beacon on so I can find you.</i>

644
00:50:28,597 --> 00:50:30,264
We'll get to the bottom of this Vers.

645
00:50:31,166 --> 00:50:32,167
Together.

646
00:50:35,304 --> 00:50:36,104
Ok.

647
00:50:54,323 --> 00:50:55,323
Vers!

648
00:50:57,493 --> 00:50:58,493
Vers!

649
00:51:15,577 --> 00:51:17,211
Fury's colluding with the target.

650
00:51:17,413 --> 00:51:18,745
Then why would he call us in?

651
00:51:18,747 --> 00:51:20,313
All I know is we take him in, too.

652
00:51:20,315 --> 00:51:21,448
Dead or alive.

653
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:22,649
Dead or alive?

654
00:51:37,566 --> 00:51:38,701
Go. Go, go!

655
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:52,982
Was it something I said?

656
00:52:32,221 --> 00:52:36,023
Now, you know,
I don't really need these to see...

657
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:37,305
but...

658
00:52:38,106 --> 00:52:40,429
they do kinda complete the look.

659
00:52:41,363 --> 00:52:42,564
Don't you think?

660
00:53:00,215 --> 00:53:01,348
You called them in?

661
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:02,384
My bad.

662
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:18,865
Coulson, do you have eyes on them?

663
00:53:18,867 --> 00:53:20,002
They're not down here.

664
00:53:22,136 --> 00:53:23,171
Let's try up there.

665
00:53:32,381 --> 00:53:33,713
What?
Your communicator.

666
00:53:33,715 --> 00:53:35,382
You obviously can't be trusted with it.

667
00:54:06,448 --> 00:54:08,081
Do you know how to fly this thing?

668
00:54:08,283 --> 00:54:09,316
We'll see.

669
00:54:09,418 --> 00:54:11,219
That's a yes or no question.

670
00:54:15,256 --> 00:54:16,157
Yes.

671
00:54:19,595 --> 00:54:21,128
That's what I'm talking about!

672
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:49,591
We got a stowaway.

673
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,763
Hang on, Goose.

674
00:55:00,635 --> 00:55:01,635
Goose.

675
00:55:04,306 --> 00:55:05,307
No, Goose.

676
00:55:06,642 --> 00:55:08,313
Who's a good kitty?

677
00:55:08,614 --> 00:55:09,614
Goose?

678
00:55:10,278 --> 00:55:11,945
Yes, that's right.

679
00:55:12,247 --> 00:55:14,214
Who's a good kitty, Goose?

680
00:55:14,316 --> 00:55:15,615
You the good kitty, that's right.

681
00:55:15,617 --> 00:55:16,752
See anyone you know?

682
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:19,886
Funny story.

683
00:55:20,288 --> 00:55:22,319
I arrived on Hala near dead.

684
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,725
No memory.

685
00:55:24,693 --> 00:55:25,925
That was six years ago.

686
00:55:26,227 --> 00:55:28,228
So, you think you're the pilot

687
00:55:28,229 --> 00:55:29,663
that went down with Dr. Lawson?

688
00:55:29,665 --> 00:55:31,698
I'm saying the last person
to see them alive

689
00:55:31,699 --> 00:55:32,933
could probably tell us.

690
00:55:33,335 --> 00:55:34,434
Maria Rambeau?

691
00:55:34,936 --> 00:55:36,637
So, how do we get to Louisiana?

692
00:55:37,639 --> 00:55:38,675
Due east.

693
00:55:38,676 --> 00:55:40,008
Hang a right at Memphis.

694
00:55:41,643 --> 00:55:42,977
That agent...

695
00:55:43,779 --> 00:55:45,845
that stopped the Skrulls from finding us?

696
00:55:45,847 --> 00:55:47,314
Coulson. The new guy.

697
00:55:47,916 --> 00:55:49,516
I guess he doesn't hate me yet.

698
00:55:49,518 --> 00:55:51,153
Yeah, well, give him time.

699
00:55:53,255 --> 00:55:54,921
I guess he had a feeling, you know?

700
00:55:54,923 --> 00:55:56,857
Went with his gut against orders.

701
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:58,792
That's a really hard thing to do.

702
00:55:58,794 --> 00:56:00,827
But it's what keeps us human.

703
00:56:00,829 --> 00:56:02,433
I get in trouble for that.

704
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,697
A lot.
I can see that about you.

705
00:56:05,734 --> 00:56:09,003
Rescuing the guy who sold you out
to the Skrulls?

706
00:56:09,905 --> 00:56:12,972
I'm guessing that's not
standard Kree operating procedure.

707
00:56:12,974 --> 00:56:15,241
Well, I won't tell your boss
if you don't tell mine.

708
00:56:23,485 --> 00:56:24,485
Ronan.

709
00:56:24,619 --> 00:56:26,653
<i>The Accusers completed their operation,</i>

710
00:56:26,655 --> 00:56:28,054
<i>but the greater mission was a failure,</i>

711
00:56:28,056 --> 00:56:29,256
<i>thanks to your team.</i>

712
00:56:29,257 --> 00:56:30,524
It was a trap,

713
00:56:30,926 --> 00:56:33,760
to lure our operative Vers
to Torfa and kidnap her.

714
00:56:33,762 --> 00:56:34,894
<i>Give us their location.</i>

715
00:56:34,896 --> 00:56:36,696
<i>We'll take care of the terrorist threat.</i>

716
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,434
By bombing them out of the galaxy?

717
00:56:39,801 --> 00:56:40,629
No,

718
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:43,803
we'll handle this.
<i>A cell of Skrulls anywhere,</i>

719
00:56:43,804 --> 00:56:46,239
<i>is a threat to Kree everywhere.</i>

720
00:56:46,341 --> 00:56:47,407
<i>Where are they?</i>

721
00:56:47,409 --> 00:56:48,477
They are...
Lost.

722
00:56:50,312 --> 00:56:52,179
They are lost, for now.

723
00:56:52,781 --> 00:56:54,214
But we will find them.

724
00:56:54,516 --> 00:56:55,550
<i>Do so...</i>

725
00:56:56,851 --> 00:56:58,086
<i>or we will.</i>

726
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:04,126
Maintain the course for C-53.

727
00:57:23,745 --> 00:57:25,614
Excuse me, I'm looking for Maria Rambeau.

728
00:57:28,049 --> 00:57:29,516
Auntie Carol?

729
00:57:29,618 --> 00:57:31,553
Mom, it's Auntie Carol!

730
00:57:32,721 --> 00:57:34,955
I knew it!
Everyone said you were dead!

731
00:57:35,457 --> 00:57:37,126
But we knew they were lying.

732
00:57:39,628 --> 00:57:41,430
I'm not really who you think I am.

733
00:57:50,906 --> 00:57:53,006
That is the craziest shit I ever heard.

734
00:57:53,008 --> 00:57:54,652
Green transforming aliens?

735
00:57:54,853 --> 00:57:56,142
There's no such thing.

736
00:57:56,144 --> 00:57:57,844
You are absolutely right, young lady.

737
00:57:57,846 --> 00:57:59,579
There is no such thing.

738
00:57:59,581 --> 00:58:00,847
Because if there were,

739
00:58:00,949 --> 00:58:03,250
we would want to keep that to ourselves.

740
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,667
You don't believe me?

741
00:58:12,727 --> 00:58:14,160
No way!

742
00:58:14,462 --> 00:58:16,229
That's so cool!

743
00:58:16,531 --> 00:58:19,199
She can do a lot more than make tea
with those hands.

744
00:58:19,201 --> 00:58:20,300
Like what? Show us.

745
00:58:21,002 --> 00:58:22,003
Maybe later.

746
00:58:23,004 --> 00:58:24,137
I kept all your stuff.

747
00:58:24,139 --> 00:58:25,273
I'll go get it.

748
00:58:26,475 --> 00:58:28,143
You want to give her a hand with that?

749
00:58:44,659 --> 00:58:46,395
You don't remember anything?

750
00:58:47,963 --> 00:58:49,073
I see...

751
00:58:50,074 --> 00:58:51,099
flashes.

752
00:58:52,534 --> 00:58:53,735
Little moments.

753
00:58:54,836 --> 00:58:56,238
But I can't tell what's real.

754
00:58:58,673 --> 00:59:01,442
If I could just piece together
what happened that morning...

755
00:59:02,544 --> 00:59:04,379
maybe it'll all make sense.

756
00:59:07,482 --> 00:59:08,902
You woke me up...

757
00:59:09,303 --> 00:59:11,085
banging on my door at dawn.

758
00:59:11,187 --> 00:59:12,720
Your usual move.

759
00:59:13,622 --> 00:59:15,956
Back then, we had to get up so early.

760
00:59:16,558 --> 00:59:18,992
The Air Force still wasn't
letting women fly combat,

761
00:59:19,194 --> 00:59:22,896
so testing Lawson's planes was our only
shot at doing something that mattered.

762
00:59:23,098 --> 00:59:24,704
You wanted to race to base,

763
00:59:24,705 --> 00:59:25,999
in your old Mustang...

764
00:59:26,201 --> 00:59:29,035
and I wasn't about to argue because
I knew my Camaro would dominate.

765
00:59:29,137 --> 00:59:30,561
But you cheated,

766
00:59:30,562 --> 00:59:32,839
took a shortcut.
Since when is a shortcut cheating?

767
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,190
Since it violates the predetermined
rules of engagement.

768
00:59:35,191 --> 00:59:36,707
I definitely don't remember those.

769
00:59:37,011 --> 00:59:38,211
Of course you don't.

770
00:59:43,151 --> 00:59:44,770
When I got to the hangar...

771
00:59:45,171 --> 00:59:48,021
Lawson was agitated.

772
00:59:48,723 --> 00:59:51,525
She said she had lives to save.

773
00:59:52,727 --> 00:59:54,628
She was trying to take
the Asis up herself,

774
00:59:54,629 --> 00:59:57,120
but you said that...
If there were lives at stake,

775
00:59:57,621 --> 00:59:59,562
I would fly the plane.
Yeah.

776
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:03,237
Yep. Big hero moment.

777
01:00:03,939 --> 01:00:06,274
The kind of moment we'd both
been waiting for.

778
01:00:07,876 --> 01:00:09,502
The doc was always unique.

779
01:00:10,303 --> 01:00:11,478
That's why we liked her.

780
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:12,658
But...

781
01:00:12,959 --> 01:00:14,448
now you're saying she's...

782
01:00:14,649 --> 01:00:16,118
from another planet.

783
01:00:18,019 --> 01:00:19,552
I know this must be hard for you.

784
01:00:19,554 --> 01:00:20,890
Oh, what?
This part right here?

785
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:23,167
No.

786
01:00:23,968 --> 01:00:24,602
No.

787
01:00:27,629 --> 01:00:28,674
What's hard...

788
01:00:29,175 --> 01:00:31,265
is losing my best friend...

789
01:00:32,067 --> 01:00:35,470
in a mission so secret they act
like it never even happened.

790
01:00:37,572 --> 01:00:38,651
Hard...

791
01:00:39,252 --> 01:00:42,811
is knowing you were out there somewhere
too damn stubborn to die.

792
01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:47,214
And now you come up in
here after six years...

793
01:00:47,316 --> 01:00:51,051
with your supercharged fire hands
and you expect me to call you...

794
01:00:51,653 --> 01:00:53,189
I don't even know what. Vers?

795
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:56,558
Is that really who you are now?

796
01:00:59,261 --> 01:01:00,296
I don't know.

797
01:01:06,067 --> 01:01:07,102
Come look!

798
01:01:14,042 --> 01:01:15,842
This is me and you on Halloween.

799
01:01:15,844 --> 01:01:19,013
I'm Amelia Earhart
and you're Janis Joplin.

800
01:01:19,215 --> 01:01:20,947
Oh, this is you when you were little.

801
01:01:21,149 --> 01:01:22,815
You didn't get along with your parents,

802
01:01:23,017 --> 01:01:24,784
so Mom said we became your real family.

803
01:01:24,986 --> 01:01:26,553
This is us on Christmas.

804
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,288
I got my favorite bunny slippers.

805
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:29,223
This is another picture of you
when you were little.

806
01:01:29,325 --> 01:01:30,656
You've always wanted to be a pilot.

807
01:01:30,658 --> 01:01:31,658
And this is right after you graduated.

808
01:01:31,659 --> 01:01:32,959
This was your dog that
you got for Christmas...

809
01:01:32,961 --> 01:01:35,195
This is a picture of everybody
from your Air Force team.

810
01:01:35,197 --> 01:01:37,864
And this is you with Mom
right after a good day of training.

811
01:01:37,866 --> 01:01:39,166
These were your three favorite guys.

812
01:01:41,603 --> 01:01:42,702
Oh, wait. I forgot.

813
01:01:42,904 --> 01:01:43,904
Your jacket.

814
01:01:44,606 --> 01:01:47,342
Mom doesn't let me wear it anymore
after I spilled ketchup on it.

815
01:02:00,756 --> 01:02:02,658
That was all that survived the crash.

816
01:02:04,393 --> 01:02:05,827
Or so we thought.

817
01:02:10,732 --> 01:02:11,865
Don't answer that.

818
01:02:12,767 --> 01:02:14,101
It's just my neighbor.

819
01:02:14,403 --> 01:02:16,037
They can change into anyone.

820
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:22,509
Hi there.

821
01:02:22,911 --> 01:02:23,912
What do you want?

822
01:02:25,281 --> 01:02:27,080
Hey, Tom.

823
01:02:27,082 --> 01:02:28,748
This is my friend, Carol.

824
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:30,151
Oh. Pleased to meet you.

825
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:33,320
Yowzers.

826
01:02:33,422 --> 01:02:35,656
Static electricity out here's no joke.

827
01:02:36,658 --> 01:02:39,673
I noticed that peculiar bird you got
parked by the road and I...

828
01:02:39,774 --> 01:02:41,330
I was just wondering if you mind
if I bring the...

829
01:02:41,331 --> 01:02:43,062
boys over to get a closer look-see?

830
01:02:43,264 --> 01:02:44,822
A closer look-see?

831
01:02:45,123 --> 01:02:48,203
Yeah.
To see the bird parked out by the road?

832
01:02:50,038 --> 01:02:52,612
You're really working overtime
to sell this one, aren't you,

833
01:02:53,013 --> 01:02:54,141
Talos?

834
01:02:55,043 --> 01:02:56,125
I'm sorry, Tom.

835
01:02:56,126 --> 01:02:57,644
This really isn't a good time.

836
01:02:57,645 --> 01:02:59,346
I'll come by tomorrow, ok?

837
01:03:00,248 --> 01:03:01,150
Ok.

838
01:03:03,751 --> 01:03:06,687
You know, you really should be
kinder to your neighbors.

839
01:03:07,689 --> 01:03:10,225
You never know when you're gonna
need to borrow some sugar.

840
01:03:14,062 --> 01:03:15,362
Hang on a second.

841
01:03:15,464 --> 01:03:19,066
Before you go swinging
those jazz hands around...

842
01:03:19,468 --> 01:03:22,137
making a mess of your friend's house...

843
01:03:22,937 --> 01:03:24,338
It's a lovely home, miss.

844
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:25,440
Oh, my God!

845
01:03:26,074 --> 01:03:27,307
What the hell?

846
01:03:31,313 --> 01:03:32,881
No one's gonna hurt the girl.

847
01:03:33,415 --> 01:03:35,348
Just don't kill me.

848
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:38,017
That would really complicate
the situation.

849
01:03:38,019 --> 01:03:40,820
I'm about five seconds
from complicating that wall

850
01:03:40,822 --> 01:03:42,189
with some ugly-ass Skrull brains.

851
01:03:42,391 --> 01:03:43,956
I'm sorry I simmed your boss.

852
01:03:43,958 --> 01:03:47,027
But now I stand before you
as my true self.

853
01:03:47,729 --> 01:03:48,995
Without deception.

854
01:03:48,997 --> 01:03:50,099
And who is that out there?

855
01:03:51,099 --> 01:03:53,133
Ok, that's a fair point...

856
01:03:53,335 --> 01:03:55,005
but I'm sure that you understand,

857
01:03:55,337 --> 01:03:57,170
I had to take some precautions.

858
01:03:57,772 --> 01:04:02,141
I saw you crush 20 of my best
men with your hands bound.

859
01:04:02,143 --> 01:04:03,377
I just wanna talk.

860
01:04:03,379 --> 01:04:05,878
Last time we talked, I ended up
hanging from my ankles.

861
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,182
That was before
I knew who you were.

862
01:04:08,384 --> 01:04:11,286
Before I knew what made you
different from the others.

863
01:04:12,754 --> 01:04:15,154
I have an audio recording from Pegasus,

864
01:04:15,356 --> 01:04:19,559
of your voice from a plane crash
six years ago,

865
01:04:19,761 --> 01:04:23,564
on a device I believe
you call a black box.

866
01:04:24,266 --> 01:04:26,399
They told me it was destroyed
in the crash.

867
01:04:27,301 --> 01:04:28,302
How'd you get it?

868
01:04:28,304 --> 01:04:29,369
She don't understand.

869
01:04:29,371 --> 01:04:32,439
Young lady, I have a special skill
that kind of allows me,

870
01:04:32,541 --> 01:04:34,508
to get into places
I'm not supposed to be.

871
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:35,875
Call me young lady again,

872
01:04:35,877 --> 01:04:38,313
I'm gonna put my foot in a place
it's not supposed to be.

873
01:04:40,782 --> 01:04:43,051
Am I supposed to guess,
where that is?

874
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:44,519
Your ass.

875
01:04:44,587 --> 01:04:47,487
Ok, I get it. We're all
a little on edge here.

876
01:04:47,589 --> 01:04:49,456
But look, I just need your help

877
01:04:49,458 --> 01:04:50,957
decoding some coordinates.

878
01:04:51,059 --> 01:04:53,059
If you'll sit down and you'll listen to this...

879
01:04:53,161 --> 01:04:55,997
I assure you, it'll be worth your while.

880
01:04:58,866 --> 01:05:00,535
Call your buddy back inside
and I'll listen.

881
01:05:01,537 --> 01:05:02,802
Deal.

882
01:05:03,905 --> 01:05:04,617
Oh, my God!

883
01:05:04,618 --> 01:05:06,874
Get that thing away.
How'd that get in here?

884
01:05:09,877 --> 01:05:10,877
The cat?

885
01:05:10,979 --> 01:05:12,379
This isn't what you're afraid of, is it?

886
01:05:12,481 --> 01:05:13,881
That's not a cat.

887
01:05:14,816 --> 01:05:16,783
That's a Flerken.
A Flerken?

888
01:05:17,685 --> 01:05:18,685
Mom?

889
01:05:26,094 --> 01:05:26,994
Monica.

890
01:05:27,029 --> 01:05:28,363
Why can't I listen, too?

891
01:05:56,525 --> 01:05:57,591
What's happening?

892
01:05:58,193 --> 01:05:59,195
It's loading.

893
01:06:03,532 --> 01:06:09,169
<i>Punch in the coordinates 5-2-2-9,
negative 4-7, 8.7-6-8, 0.2.</i>

894
01:06:09,371 --> 01:06:10,070
<i>Copy that.</i>

895
01:06:10,371 --> 01:06:11,471
<i>Where are we going, Doc?</i>

896
01:06:11,573 --> 01:06:12,906
<i>My laboratory.</i>

897
01:06:13,208 --> 01:06:14,306
<i>Your laboratory?</i>

898
01:06:14,307 --> 01:06:15,509
<i>What do you mean?</i>

899
01:06:15,511 --> 01:06:16,543
<i>Oh, no.</i>

900
01:06:16,545 --> 01:06:17,922
<i>Is that...</i>

901
01:06:17,923 --> 01:06:19,011
<i>Wait, what is that?</i>

902
01:06:19,013 --> 01:06:20,480
<i>It's not showing up on my radar.</i>

903
01:06:20,482 --> 01:06:21,882
<i>Go, Carol. Fly!</i>

904
01:06:22,384 --> 01:06:24,917
That's no MiG, Lawson.
Who the hell are they?

905
01:06:24,919 --> 01:06:27,387
Those are the bad guys.
Fly faster now!

906
01:06:27,388 --> 01:06:28,189
Yes, ma'am.

907
01:06:34,095 --> 01:06:35,352
What do they want? Me.

908
01:06:35,353 --> 01:06:36,330
My work.

909
01:06:36,532 --> 01:06:38,032
I never should have brought you along.

910
01:06:43,104 --> 01:06:44,205
Here come some G's.

911
01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:05,027
They're firing backwards.
Hold on!

912
01:07:16,672 --> 01:07:18,072
Bail out! Bail out! Bail out!

913
01:07:22,009 --> 01:07:23,111
Stay with me, Lawson!

914
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:42,729
<i>Carol, come in. Do you copy?</i>

915
01:07:42,731 --> 01:07:43,927
Yeah, I copy.

916
01:07:44,328 --> 01:07:45,499
We hit ground.

917
01:07:45,601 --> 01:07:47,167
<i>Carol, are you ok?
Do you copy?</i>

918
01:07:47,169 --> 01:07:48,804
Yeah! I copy.

919
01:07:52,106 --> 01:07:52,907
Doc?

920
01:07:54,108 --> 01:07:55,108
Your blood.

921
01:07:56,311 --> 01:07:57,411
It's blue.

922
01:07:58,213 --> 01:07:59,204
Yeah but how's...

923
01:08:00,105 --> 01:08:01,450
How's my hair?

924
01:08:02,718 --> 01:08:04,220
Help me out, will ya?

925
01:08:08,257 --> 01:08:10,425
I gotta destroy it before they get here.

926
01:08:11,427 --> 01:08:12,425
Lawson?

927
01:08:13,027 --> 01:08:15,029
You remember what I said
about our work here?

928
01:08:15,531 --> 01:08:16,632
What it's for?

929
01:08:17,666 --> 01:08:18,966
To end wars?

930
01:08:19,168 --> 01:08:20,226
Yeah.

931
01:08:20,227 --> 01:08:22,171
But the wars are bigger than you know.

932
01:08:24,038 --> 01:08:25,107
Damn it!

933
01:08:26,107 --> 01:08:28,342
My name is not Lawson.

934
01:08:28,444 --> 01:08:30,745
My real name is Mar-Vell,

935
01:08:31,547 --> 01:08:34,081
and I come from a planet called Hala.

936
01:08:35,651 --> 01:08:37,850
I would say that you're delusional but...

937
01:08:38,052 --> 01:08:40,887
we just got shot down by a spaceship
and your blood is blue.

938
01:08:42,089 --> 01:08:45,291
Listen, I spent half my life
fighting a shameful war.

939
01:08:46,093 --> 01:08:48,729
Now, skedaddle before you give me
any more regrets.

940
01:08:49,331 --> 01:08:51,164
Just remember the coordinates, ok?

941
01:08:52,066 --> 01:08:53,667
You gotta save them without me.

942
01:08:53,669 --> 01:08:54,668
Save who? How?

943
01:08:54,670 --> 01:08:58,070
Now I gotta blow this engine
before they find it.

944
01:08:58,072 --> 01:08:59,108
What are you doing?

945
01:09:19,261 --> 01:09:21,330
We have no interest in hurting you.

946
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:22,630
No?

947
01:09:22,898 --> 01:09:25,767
Because all the shooting kinda
gave me the wrong impression!

948
01:09:27,402 --> 01:09:28,670
The energy core.

949
01:09:29,638 --> 01:09:30,771
Where is it?

950
01:09:31,173 --> 01:09:32,607
Pararescue's on the way.

951
01:09:33,609 --> 01:09:35,775
You have two minutes
until you're surrounded.

952
01:09:35,877 --> 01:09:38,612
Then I see no reason
to prolong this conversation.

953
01:09:38,614 --> 01:09:39,648
No, wait!

954
01:09:46,188 --> 01:09:47,489
You mean that energy core?

955
01:09:52,126 --> 01:09:53,128
No!

956
01:10:36,738 --> 01:10:37,738
Commander?

957
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:38,939
She's still moving.

958
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:40,373
Permission to fire.

959
01:10:40,375 --> 01:10:41,376
Hold your fire.

960
01:10:51,386 --> 01:10:52,720
There's nothing left.

961
01:10:53,422 --> 01:10:54,856
The core has been destroyed.

962
01:11:04,633 --> 01:11:06,435
She absorbed its power.

963
01:11:08,837 --> 01:11:10,372
She's coming with us.

964
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:32,861
He lied to me.

965
01:11:35,564 --> 01:11:37,664
Everything that I knew was a lie.

966
01:11:37,666 --> 01:11:40,400
Now, you understand.

967
01:11:40,502 --> 01:11:41,476
What?

968
01:11:41,477 --> 01:11:43,036
What do I understand now?

969
01:11:43,138 --> 01:11:44,771
Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell.

970
01:11:44,973 --> 01:11:46,074
He killed her...

971
01:11:46,975 --> 01:11:50,236
because she found out that
she was on the wrong side...

972
01:11:50,437 --> 01:11:52,312
of an unjust war.

973
01:11:52,314 --> 01:11:53,314
No.

974
01:11:53,815 --> 01:11:55,549
Your people are terrorists.

975
01:11:56,251 --> 01:11:57,384
They kill innocents.

976
01:11:57,786 --> 01:11:59,719
I saw the ruins on Torfa.

977
01:11:59,721 --> 01:12:02,223
Ruins that the Accusers
are responsible for.

978
01:12:03,425 --> 01:12:07,094
My people lived as refugees on Torfa.

979
01:12:07,496 --> 01:12:10,597
Homeless, ever since
we resisted Kree rule,

980
01:12:10,599 --> 01:12:12,632
and they destroyed our planet.

981
01:12:12,734 --> 01:12:15,169
And the handful of us that are left...

982
01:12:16,471 --> 01:12:18,638
will be slaughtered next...

983
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:22,244
unless you help me finish
what Mar-Vell started.

984
01:12:23,879 --> 01:12:25,289
The core that she found,

985
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:29,015
would have powered a light-speed ship
capable of carrying us to safety.

986
01:12:29,017 --> 01:12:29,950
A new home...

987
01:12:30,851 --> 01:12:32,688
where the Kree can't reach us.

988
01:12:34,589 --> 01:12:38,258
Lawson always told us that our work
at Pegasus wasn't to fight wars...

989
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:39,559
but to end them.

990
01:12:39,961 --> 01:12:45,100
She wanted you
to help us find the core.

991
01:12:46,568 --> 01:12:47,767
Well, I already destroyed it.

992
01:12:47,769 --> 01:12:49,536
No, you destroyed the engine.

993
01:12:49,538 --> 01:12:52,272
The core that powered it
is in a remote location.

994
01:12:52,674 --> 01:12:55,943
If you help us decode those coordinates...

995
01:12:57,045 --> 01:12:58,380
we can find it.

996
01:13:00,515 --> 01:13:02,217
You'll use it to destroy us.

997
01:13:05,553 --> 01:13:07,022
We just want a home.

998
01:13:11,626 --> 01:13:12,719
You and I...

999
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:16,930
lost everything at the hands
of the Kree.

1000
01:13:16,932 --> 01:13:18,432
Can't you see it now?

1001
01:13:18,934 --> 01:13:20,435
You're not one of them.

1002
01:13:23,472 --> 01:13:24,673
You don't know me.

1003
01:13:26,374 --> 01:13:28,444
You have no idea who I am.

1004
01:13:30,846 --> 01:13:32,748
I don't even know who I am!

1005
01:13:34,483 --> 01:13:36,518
You are Carol Danvers.

1006
01:13:37,919 --> 01:13:41,388
You are the woman on that
black box risking her life,

1007
01:13:41,389 --> 01:13:42,724
to do the right thing.

1008
01:13:44,559 --> 01:13:45,793
My best friend...

1009
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:48,492
who supported me as a mother,

1010
01:13:48,493 --> 01:13:50,764
and a pilot when no one else did.

1011
01:13:51,566 --> 01:13:52,722
You are smart,

1012
01:13:53,023 --> 01:13:53,945
and funny,

1013
01:13:53,946 --> 01:13:55,670
and a huge pain in the ass...

1014
01:13:56,772 --> 01:13:59,706
and you were the most
powerful person I knew...

1015
01:14:00,108 --> 01:14:02,378
way before you could
shoot fire from your fists.

1016
01:14:03,979 --> 01:14:05,014
You hear me?

1017
01:14:06,848 --> 01:14:08,083
Do you hear me?

1018
01:14:15,891 --> 01:14:16,747
Come here.

1019
01:14:16,748 --> 01:14:17,793
Come here, girl.

1020
01:14:18,627 --> 01:14:19,661
I got you.

1021
01:14:24,366 --> 01:14:26,567
I know I don't deserve your trust,

1022
01:14:27,369 --> 01:14:29,603
but you were our only lead.

1023
01:14:29,805 --> 01:14:32,071
We discovered that
your energy signature,

1024
01:14:32,373 --> 01:14:34,576
matched Mar-Vell's core.

1025
01:14:35,744 --> 01:14:37,012
Now we know why.

1026
01:14:39,481 --> 01:14:41,335
If only you knew...

1027
01:14:41,336 --> 01:14:43,451
the importance of it to me.

1028
01:14:44,553 --> 01:14:45,986
I just need your help,

1029
01:14:46,388 --> 01:14:49,990
decoding the coordinates
to Mar-Vell's lab.

1030
01:14:50,592 --> 01:14:52,123
Those weren't coordinates.

1031
01:14:52,124 --> 01:14:53,560
They're state vectors.

1032
01:14:53,762 --> 01:14:55,829
For orbital position and velocity.

1033
01:14:55,831 --> 01:14:57,664
You didn't find her lab on Earth,

1034
01:14:57,666 --> 01:14:58,898
because it's not on Earth.

1035
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,534
That was the location
on the date of the crash six years ago.

1036
01:15:01,536 --> 01:15:05,471
If we track its course,
we'll find it in orbit right now.

1037
01:15:05,473 --> 01:15:06,942
It's just basic physics.

1038
01:15:09,611 --> 01:15:10,612
In orbit?

1039
01:15:12,547 --> 01:15:14,147
Was that so difficult to figure out?

1040
01:15:14,149 --> 01:15:16,183
I mean, you're my science guy, right?

1041
01:15:17,085 --> 01:15:18,919
Yon-Rogg will catch up to me soon.

1042
01:15:19,821 --> 01:15:21,955
We've got to get to the core
before he does.

1043
01:15:22,657 --> 01:15:23,824
We're going to space?

1044
01:15:24,526 --> 01:15:25,592
In what?

1045
01:15:25,594 --> 01:15:27,493
A few tweaks to your vessel should do it.

1046
01:15:27,495 --> 01:15:29,429
I can handle the modifications.

1047
01:15:29,731 --> 01:15:30,966
Your science guy.

1048
01:15:38,207 --> 01:15:39,541
Well, I could use a copilot.

1049
01:15:41,109 --> 01:15:43,776
No. No, I can't.

1050
01:15:43,978 --> 01:15:45,312
I can't leave Monica.

1051
01:15:45,814 --> 01:15:48,815
Mom, it's ok. I can stay
with Gramma and Papa.

1052
01:15:49,117 --> 01:15:51,484
There's no way I'm going, baby.
It's too dangerous.

1053
01:15:51,486 --> 01:15:53,553
Testing brand-new aerospace
tech is dangerous,

1054
01:15:53,555 --> 01:15:54,589
and you used to do that.

1055
01:15:56,225 --> 01:15:58,192
Your plan is to leave the atmosphere

1056
01:15:58,194 --> 01:15:59,859
in a craft not designed for the journey,

1057
01:15:59,861 --> 01:16:01,694
and you anticipate hostile encounters,

1058
01:16:01,696 --> 01:16:03,798
with a technologically-superior
foreign enemy.

1059
01:16:04,233 --> 01:16:05,233
Correct?

1060
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:06,866
That's what I'm saying.

1061
01:16:06,868 --> 01:16:08,034
You have to go!
Monica!

1062
01:16:08,136 --> 01:16:10,770
You have a chance to fly the coolest
mission in the history of missions,

1063
01:16:10,772 --> 01:16:13,742
and you're gonna give it up to sit on
the couch and watch Fresh Prince with me?

1064
01:16:14,643 --> 01:16:15,443
What?

1065
01:16:15,444 --> 01:16:19,482
I just think you should consider what kind
of example you're setting for your daughter.

1066
01:16:27,856 --> 01:16:29,156
What's going on around here?

1067
01:16:29,258 --> 01:16:31,055
I know, I know.
I'll explain inside.

1068
01:16:31,056 --> 01:16:31,927
Thank you.

1069
01:16:36,932 --> 01:16:38,366
Your mom's lucky.

1070
01:16:39,268 --> 01:16:42,169
When they were handing out kids,
they gave her the toughest one.

1071
01:16:42,971 --> 01:16:44,072
Lieutenant Trouble.

1072
01:16:44,973 --> 01:16:46,108
You remembered.

1073
01:16:47,976 --> 01:16:49,044
Is that mine?

1074
01:16:50,145 --> 01:16:51,279
No, no.

1075
01:16:52,281 --> 01:16:54,148
You hang on to it until I come back.

1076
01:16:55,150 --> 01:16:57,750
But there is something
that I need your help with.

1077
01:16:57,852 --> 01:17:00,120
I can't wear these Kree colors anymore.

1078
01:17:00,722 --> 01:17:03,790
And since you are obviously
the only person around here

1079
01:17:03,792 --> 01:17:05,060
with any sense of style...

1080
01:17:13,735 --> 01:17:14,903
No.

1081
01:17:19,741 --> 01:17:21,275
Definitely not.

1082
01:17:24,246 --> 01:17:26,381
Well, since we're on the same team...

1083
01:17:40,196 --> 01:17:41,863
How do I look?

1084
01:17:45,301 --> 01:17:46,335
Fresh.

1085
01:18:06,654 --> 01:18:08,021
What took you so long?

1086
01:18:08,723 --> 01:18:09,725
I'm fine.

1087
01:18:09,726 --> 01:18:10,991
Thanks for asking.

1088
01:18:11,693 --> 01:18:13,727
PRY46-B...
No, no codes.

1089
01:18:14,129 --> 01:18:15,897
That system is fallible, as we've learned.

1090
01:18:16,931 --> 01:18:18,466
Ok, then let's do this.

1091
01:18:19,268 --> 01:18:20,574
Who do I see,

1092
01:18:20,575 --> 01:18:22,735
when I commune with
the Supreme Intelligence?

1093
01:18:22,737 --> 01:18:25,538
The person you most admire
and respect, I'd guess.

1094
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:26,908
But you would never tell me who.

1095
01:18:28,244 --> 01:18:31,644
And what is your earliest
memory of Hala?

1096
01:18:31,646 --> 01:18:32,880
The transfusion.

1097
01:18:33,182 --> 01:18:34,882
Blue blood running through my veins.

1098
01:18:35,384 --> 01:18:36,484
Whose blood?

1099
01:18:47,695 --> 01:18:48,757
That's my blood,

1100
01:18:49,058 --> 01:18:51,033
that's coursing through her veins.

1101
01:18:56,272 --> 01:18:57,870
What have you done with her?

1102
01:18:57,872 --> 01:18:59,041
You're too late.

1103
01:19:16,325 --> 01:19:17,359
She knows?

1104
01:19:32,107 --> 01:19:35,675
Ronan, Skrulls have infiltrated C-53.

1105
01:19:35,677 --> 01:19:36,709
Come at once.

1106
01:19:36,811 --> 01:19:38,945
<i>For the good of all Kree Commander,</i>

1107
01:19:39,047 --> 01:19:41,281
<i>the infestation will be eradicated.</i>

1108
01:19:44,018 --> 01:19:45,887
Passing 500 and climbing.

1109
01:19:49,057 --> 01:19:52,326
You know, you really
shouldn't have that thing on your lap.

1110
01:19:52,328 --> 01:19:53,973
Our little alliance with you,

1111
01:19:54,274 --> 01:19:55,695
is tenuous at best.

1112
01:19:55,797 --> 01:19:58,698
And as long as he continues
to freak you out...

1113
01:19:58,700 --> 01:19:59,866
like that...

1114
01:19:59,968 --> 01:20:02,369
yeah, I'm gonna keep giving him

1115
01:20:02,371 --> 01:20:05,372
all the loves and hugs that he needs, right?

1116
01:20:05,374 --> 01:20:07,074
Can I ask you something?

1117
01:20:07,176 --> 01:20:09,276
Do you just turn into anything you want?

1118
01:20:09,378 --> 01:20:11,145
Well, I have to see it first.

1119
01:20:11,247 --> 01:20:12,279
Can you all do it?

1120
01:20:12,881 --> 01:20:14,714
Physiologically? Yeah.

1121
01:20:14,816 --> 01:20:17,669
But, it takes practice and...

1122
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:18,976
dare I say it,

1123
01:20:18,977 --> 01:20:20,821
talent to do it well.

1124
01:20:21,022 --> 01:20:21,955
Can you turn into a cat?

1125
01:20:22,256 --> 01:20:23,423
What's a cat?

1126
01:20:23,424 --> 01:20:24,859
What about a filing cabinet?

1127
01:20:25,261 --> 01:20:28,328
Why would I turn into a filing cabinet?

1128
01:20:28,330 --> 01:20:29,247
A Venus flytrap?

1129
01:20:29,248 --> 01:20:32,031
I'll give you 50 bucks right now
if you turn into a Venus flytrap.

1130
01:20:32,633 --> 01:20:35,251
Switching engines
from Scramjet to Fusion.

1131
01:20:35,252 --> 01:20:36,270
Buckle up, folks.

1132
01:20:45,214 --> 01:20:46,145
Hey.

1133
01:20:46,347 --> 01:20:49,015
Is this normal, like space turbulence?

1134
01:20:49,017 --> 01:20:50,018
Pretty much.

1135
01:21:23,818 --> 01:21:25,420
Locking in on coordinate grid.

1136
01:21:26,288 --> 01:21:27,456
Where is it?

1137
01:21:31,059 --> 01:21:33,393
It's here.
It's gotta be here.

1138
01:21:33,995 --> 01:21:35,945
Well, is it in front...

1139
01:21:36,346 --> 01:21:38,801
of all that nothing or behind it?

1140
01:21:44,839 --> 01:21:46,506
<i>Decloaking activated.</i>

1141
01:22:49,904 --> 01:22:51,605
Is that it? The core?

1142
01:22:51,607 --> 01:22:53,742
In her notes she called it the Tesseract.

1143
01:23:02,884 --> 01:23:05,053
What was Lawson doing with all this kid stuff?

1144
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,099
We're not alone.

1145
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:44,169
Talos!

1146
01:23:54,370 --> 01:23:56,372
He didn't come here for the Tesseract.

1147
01:24:19,728 --> 01:24:20,795
It's ok.

1148
01:24:26,067 --> 01:24:27,601
We didn't know what to do.

1149
01:24:27,703 --> 01:24:30,471
Mar-Vell warned us not to send
a signal for any reason...

1150
01:24:31,273 --> 01:24:32,738
or the Kree would find us.

1151
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,443
You did the right thing.

1152
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:45,853
It's ok, it's ok.

1153
01:24:46,455 --> 01:24:48,224
She's alright.
She's a friend.

1154
01:24:50,559 --> 01:24:52,192
I am not gonna hurt you.

1155
01:24:52,494 --> 01:24:53,996
She led me to you.

1156
01:24:55,197 --> 01:24:56,498
I'm so sorry.

1157
01:24:58,367 --> 01:24:59,499
I didn't know.

1158
01:24:59,701 --> 01:25:00,835
Carol.

1159
01:25:01,603 --> 01:25:03,138
This is war.

1160
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:06,842
My hands are filthy from it, too.

1161
01:25:08,577 --> 01:25:10,710
But we're here now.

1162
01:25:10,712 --> 01:25:12,748
You found my family.

1163
01:25:16,785 --> 01:25:18,752
This is just the beginning.

1164
01:25:18,754 --> 01:25:21,557
There are thousands of us
separated from each other...

1165
01:25:22,758 --> 01:25:25,327
scattered throughout the galaxy.

1166
01:25:43,345 --> 01:25:45,645
If I played the same pinball
machine for six years,

1167
01:25:45,647 --> 01:25:47,547
I'd have some high scores, too.

1168
01:25:50,285 --> 01:25:52,486
Fraternizing with the enemy?

1169
01:26:05,967 --> 01:26:08,168
What did you do to your uniform?

1170
01:26:08,169 --> 01:26:09,245
They got in her head.

1171
01:26:09,246 --> 01:26:10,504
Just like we thought.

1172
01:26:10,505 --> 01:26:12,071
The Supreme Intelligence
will set her straight.

1173
01:26:12,073 --> 01:26:13,841
You can see they're not soldiers.

1174
01:26:14,142 --> 01:26:15,142
Let them go.

1175
01:26:15,179 --> 01:26:16,108
You can have me.

1176
01:26:16,110 --> 01:26:17,144
And the core?

1177
01:26:17,646 --> 01:26:19,246
You lied to me.

1178
01:26:19,448 --> 01:26:22,850
I made you the best version of yourself.

1179
01:26:26,555 --> 01:26:29,456
What's given, can be taken away.

1180
01:26:43,372 --> 01:26:44,471
Back here! Move, move!

1181
01:26:44,473 --> 01:26:46,441
Get over here. Get down!

1182
01:26:47,543 --> 01:26:49,312
Let's go! Go, move!

1183
01:27:29,551 --> 01:27:30,984
There she is.

1184
01:27:31,286 --> 01:27:34,323
Seems like your time on C-53
jogged the old memory.

1185
01:27:35,624 --> 01:27:36,890
This jacket.

1186
01:27:37,492 --> 01:27:39,394
It's killer, by the way.

1187
01:27:42,497 --> 01:27:44,331
The music.
It's a nice touch.

1188
01:27:44,733 --> 01:27:46,566
Let me out.

1189
01:27:46,768 --> 01:27:47,901
No can do.

1190
01:27:48,503 --> 01:27:49,907
If you hurt them,

1191
01:27:50,508 --> 01:27:52,205
I will burn you to the ground.

1192
01:27:52,407 --> 01:27:53,741
With what exactly?

1193
01:27:54,343 --> 01:27:55,742
Your power comes from us.

1194
01:27:55,744 --> 01:27:57,677
You didn't give me these powers.

1195
01:27:58,079 --> 01:27:58,845
The blast did.

1196
01:27:58,846 --> 01:28:00,246
And yet, you've never had the strength

1197
01:28:00,247 --> 01:28:01,516
to control them on your own.

1198
01:28:12,761 --> 01:28:15,529
<i>Species: Flerken.
Threat: high.</i>

1199
01:28:21,470 --> 01:28:23,772
It's a cat, not Hannibal Lecter.

1200
01:28:26,908 --> 01:28:28,608
<i>Species: human male.</i>

1201
01:28:28,610 --> 01:28:30,812
<i>Threat: low to none.</i>

1202
01:28:31,947 --> 01:28:33,513
That thing's clearly busted.

1203
01:28:33,515 --> 01:28:35,117
Load the Flerken onto the Helion.

1204
01:28:36,451 --> 01:28:38,020
Eject the others into space.

1205
01:28:41,323 --> 01:28:42,858
You did good, Ace.

1206
01:28:44,860 --> 01:28:48,028
Thanks to you those insidious shapeshifters

1207
01:28:48,029 --> 01:28:49,796
will threaten our borders no more.

1208
01:28:49,798 --> 01:28:51,732
I used to believe your lies...

1209
01:28:52,334 --> 01:28:54,168
but the Skrulls are just fighting
for a home.

1210
01:28:54,970 --> 01:28:56,670
You're talking about destroying them

1211
01:28:56,672 --> 01:28:58,505
because they won't submit to your rule.

1212
01:28:58,507 --> 01:28:59,706
And neither will I.

1213
01:28:59,708 --> 01:29:00,934
We found you.

1214
01:29:01,235 --> 01:29:03,009
We embraced you as our own.

1215
01:29:03,011 --> 01:29:04,178
You stole me.

1216
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:05,748
From my home,

1217
01:29:05,749 --> 01:29:07,214
my family, my friends.

1218
01:29:15,524 --> 01:29:17,426
It's cute how hard you try.

1219
01:29:19,528 --> 01:29:20,963
But remember...

1220
01:29:22,531 --> 01:29:23,730
without us...

1221
01:29:23,832 --> 01:29:24,900
<i>Give it up, Carol.</i>

1222
01:29:26,668 --> 01:29:27,867
<i>Stay down!</i>

1223
01:29:27,969 --> 01:29:29,036
<i>You're weak.</i>

1224
01:29:29,638 --> 01:29:31,571
<i>You're going too fast!
You need to go slow!</i>

1225
01:29:31,573 --> 01:29:32,672
<i>You're flawed.</i>

1226
01:29:32,974 --> 01:29:34,342
<i>Are you trying to kill yourself?</i>

1227
01:29:35,310 --> 01:29:36,376
<i>Helpless.</i>

1228
01:29:36,378 --> 01:29:37,444
<i>You're too emotional and so weak.</i>

1229
01:29:37,446 --> 01:29:39,146
<i>You don't belong out here!</i>

1230
01:29:39,848 --> 01:29:41,048
<i>We saved you.</i>

1231
01:29:41,550 --> 01:29:43,016
<i>Control it.
I told you,</i>

1232
01:29:43,118 --> 01:29:44,194
<i>Carol. They'll never let you fly.</i>

1233
01:29:44,195 --> 01:29:46,416
<i>This ain't a game for little girls.
You kiss like a horse.</i>

1234
01:29:46,421 --> 01:29:47,589
<i>You won't last a week, Danvers.</i>

1235
01:29:50,659 --> 01:29:51,810
Without us...

1236
01:29:52,211 --> 01:29:53,329
you're only human.

1237
01:29:55,297 --> 01:29:56,398
You're right.

1238
01:29:57,699 --> 01:29:59,001
I'm only human.

1239
01:30:33,769 --> 01:30:36,870
On Hala, you were reborn...

1240
01:30:37,372 --> 01:30:38,373
Vers.

1241
01:30:43,678 --> 01:30:46,415
My name is Carol.

1242
01:31:01,429 --> 01:31:02,869
She's trying to break out.

1243
01:31:47,142 --> 01:31:50,512
I've been fighting with one arm
tied behind my back.

1244
01:31:51,580 --> 01:31:53,112
But what happens when...

1245
01:31:56,151 --> 01:31:57,686
I'm finally set free?

1246
01:32:38,793 --> 01:32:41,561
You know you're glowing, right?

1247
01:32:41,563 --> 01:32:42,564
I'll explain it later.

1248
01:32:45,133 --> 01:32:46,499
Take the Tesseract.

1249
01:32:46,601 --> 01:32:47,834
Leave the lunchbox.

1250
01:32:47,836 --> 01:32:49,269
Me?
Yes.

1251
01:32:49,571 --> 01:32:50,970
I'm not touching that thing.

1252
01:32:50,972 --> 01:32:52,340
You want me to get you an oven mitt?

1253
01:33:05,787 --> 01:33:07,321
Get the Skrulls on the Quadjet and go.

1254
01:33:08,523 --> 01:33:10,491
Take the Flerken with you.

1255
01:33:11,193 --> 01:33:12,961
What about you?
I'll buy you some time!

1256
01:33:15,496 --> 01:33:16,665
I'm picking you up now.

1257
01:33:19,868 --> 01:33:21,970
I'm trusting you not to eat me.

1258
01:33:27,842 --> 01:33:28,843
Oh, hey, guys.

1259
01:33:32,547 --> 01:33:34,082
Arm wrestle for the Tesseract?

1260
01:33:37,186 --> 01:33:39,052
I used to find you amusing.

1261
01:33:39,854 --> 01:33:40,855
Let's put an end to this.

1262
01:34:16,225 --> 01:34:17,193
Ok.

1263
01:34:17,759 --> 01:34:18,792
Good kitty.

1264
01:35:05,341 --> 01:35:06,842
You knew all along.

1265
01:35:08,244 --> 01:35:09,675
Is that why we never hung out?

1266
01:35:09,677 --> 01:35:10,779
No, I just never liked you.

1267
01:35:17,986 --> 01:35:18,987
Incoming!

1268
01:35:27,396 --> 01:35:28,496
Hey, in a hurry?

1269
01:35:30,799 --> 01:35:32,199
Don't make me do this.

1270
01:35:32,801 --> 01:35:33,602
Ok.

1271
01:35:49,684 --> 01:35:50,685
Come on, do your thing!

1272
01:35:51,853 --> 01:35:52,921
Come on!

1273
01:35:55,191 --> 01:35:56,489
Come on!

1274
01:35:59,828 --> 01:36:00,995
Damn it, Goose.

1275
01:36:01,197 --> 01:36:02,298
Pick a side.

1276
01:36:06,668 --> 01:36:08,201
Take them to the hangar, too.

1277
01:36:08,703 --> 01:36:10,204
We'll blast them all into space.

1278
01:36:12,408 --> 01:36:13,608
Play it cool.

1279
01:36:15,009 --> 01:36:16,278
Just like Havana.

1280
01:36:18,113 --> 01:36:19,547
Do you have the thing?

1281
01:36:20,349 --> 01:36:21,883
Flerken kitty ate it.

1282
01:36:35,297 --> 01:36:36,529
Come on, move!

1283
01:36:36,931 --> 01:36:37,831
Move!

1284
01:36:38,733 --> 01:36:39,768
Follow my lead.

1285
01:36:43,972 --> 01:36:45,073
Cover her eyes.

1286
01:36:53,982 --> 01:36:55,048
Onto the ship!

1287
01:36:55,150 --> 01:36:56,318
Let's go! Let's go!

1288
01:37:20,307 --> 01:37:21,508
Nice diversion.

1289
01:37:22,110 --> 01:37:23,912
I could have swore I put it in there.

1290
01:38:21,135 --> 01:38:23,335
Minn-Erva, take them down in the drop ship.

1291
01:38:23,437 --> 01:38:24,437
On it.

1292
01:38:28,943 --> 01:38:30,044
You alright, friend?

1293
01:38:31,112 --> 01:38:32,947
Never better.

1294
01:38:37,885 --> 01:38:39,521
We got a bogey coming in hot.

1295
01:40:19,455 --> 01:40:21,155
Yes! Boom!

1296
01:40:41,710 --> 01:40:42,877
What the hell was that?

1297
01:41:06,402 --> 01:41:08,504
Deploy ballistic warheads.

1298
01:42:00,722 --> 01:42:02,289
That's impossible.

1299
01:42:02,391 --> 01:42:04,758
C-53 doesn't have a defense system

1300
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:07,163
advanced enough to destroy our warheads.

1301
01:42:09,030 --> 01:42:11,233
That's not their defense system, Ronan.

1302
01:42:15,804 --> 01:42:17,038
Take her down.

1303
01:43:27,609 --> 01:43:29,045
Return to the jump point.

1304
01:43:30,579 --> 01:43:32,381
We'll be back for the weapon.

1305
01:43:34,316 --> 01:43:35,384
The core?

1306
01:43:37,352 --> 01:43:38,387
The woman.

1307
01:44:26,702 --> 01:44:27,970
I'm so proud of you.

1308
01:44:30,172 --> 01:44:33,440
You've come a long way since
I found you that day by the lake.

1309
01:44:34,242 --> 01:44:37,612
But can you keep your emotions in
check long enough to take me on?

1310
01:44:38,714 --> 01:44:40,950
Or will they get the better
of you as always?

1311
01:44:42,884 --> 01:44:44,351
I always told you...

1312
01:44:44,753 --> 01:44:45,952
you'll be ready,

1313
01:44:45,953 --> 01:44:48,655
the day you can knock me
down as yourself.

1314
01:44:48,657 --> 01:44:50,357
This is that moment.

1315
01:44:50,359 --> 01:44:52,492
This is that moment, Vers!

1316
01:44:52,894 --> 01:44:54,294
Turn off the light show...

1317
01:44:54,496 --> 01:44:56,372
and prove, prove to me

1318
01:44:56,673 --> 01:44:57,766
you can beat me without...

1319
01:45:12,981 --> 01:45:14,783
I have nothing to prove to you.

1320
01:45:30,866 --> 01:45:32,833
<i>Destination: Hala.</i>

1321
01:45:33,235 --> 01:45:34,768
I can't go back empty-handed.

1322
01:45:34,870 --> 01:45:36,403
You won't be empty-handed.

1323
01:45:36,805 --> 01:45:38,272
I'm sending you with a message.

1324
01:45:39,374 --> 01:45:41,842
Tell the Supreme Intelligence
that I'm coming to end it.

1325
01:45:42,644 --> 01:45:45,447
The war. The lies.
All of it.

1326
01:45:47,349 --> 01:45:48,450
You can't do this.

1327
01:46:07,569 --> 01:46:10,304
That was a close call, Goosey?

1328
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:13,740
Those bad guys still in there somewhere?

1329
01:46:14,876 --> 01:46:16,409
Mother Flerken!

1330
01:46:16,411 --> 01:46:17,644
You ok?
Yeah.

1331
01:46:17,846 --> 01:46:19,081
It's just a scratch.

1332
01:46:19,781 --> 01:46:20,816
No.

1333
01:46:28,657 --> 01:46:29,534
That's card.

1334
01:46:29,735 --> 01:46:32,726
I can't believe you got in the raddest
dogfight ever and I missed it.

1335
01:46:33,328 --> 01:46:35,128
I'd say you arrived just in time.

1336
01:46:35,129 --> 01:46:36,997
Some nifty flying you did out there.

1337
01:46:37,599 --> 01:46:39,633
S.H.I.E.L.D. could always use
a good pilot like you.

1338
01:46:39,735 --> 01:46:41,034
I'll consider it...

1339
01:46:41,636 --> 01:46:43,971
as long as you never call
my flying nifty again.

1340
01:46:44,773 --> 01:46:45,872
How's your eye?

1341
01:46:46,474 --> 01:46:48,008
Getting better every second.

1342
01:46:48,009 --> 01:46:49,209
Just so I'm clear...

1343
01:46:49,711 --> 01:46:52,849
you were Soh-Larr
and the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent?

1344
01:46:52,950 --> 01:46:53,780
Keller.

1345
01:46:53,782 --> 01:46:56,382
He tied my boss up, stole his identity.

1346
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:59,185
I borrowed his likeness.
I'm no thief.

1347
01:46:59,387 --> 01:47:00,620
It is a little like stealing.

1348
01:47:00,722 --> 01:47:02,255
Whose side are you on here?

1349
01:47:02,457 --> 01:47:04,658
You're good to go here
until you recover but...

1350
01:47:04,959 --> 01:47:06,827
you and your family
are gonna need a new look.

1351
01:47:07,329 --> 01:47:08,928
I could go back to being your boss.

1352
01:47:09,530 --> 01:47:10,276
Please don't.
Come on.

1353
01:47:10,277 --> 01:47:12,866
I loved sporting his beautiful blue eyes.

1354
01:47:13,068 --> 01:47:15,202
No way.
You guys have the best eyes.

1355
01:47:15,704 --> 01:47:17,637
Don't ever change your eyes.

1356
01:47:17,739 --> 01:47:19,372
She has beautiful eyes.
That's very sweet of you.

1357
01:47:19,374 --> 01:47:21,040
I was trying not to panic...

1358
01:47:21,242 --> 01:47:22,511
I'll help you find a home.

1359
01:47:23,678 --> 01:47:24,880
Finish what Mar-Vell started.

1360
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:29,049
They can stay here with us.

1361
01:47:29,351 --> 01:47:30,417
Can't they, Mom?

1362
01:47:30,919 --> 01:47:32,553
They won't be safe here, baby.

1363
01:47:33,555 --> 01:47:35,021
Auntie Carol's right.

1364
01:47:35,123 --> 01:47:36,524
They need their own home.

1365
01:47:37,492 --> 01:47:39,092
I'll be back before you know it.

1366
01:47:40,294 --> 01:47:42,762
Maybe I could fly up
and meet you halfway?

1367
01:47:43,064 --> 01:47:45,732
Only if you learn to glow
like your Auntie Carol.

1368
01:47:45,834 --> 01:47:47,400
Or maybe I'll build a spaceship.

1369
01:47:47,602 --> 01:47:48,417
You don't know.

1370
01:47:48,418 --> 01:47:49,404
He doesn't.

1371
01:47:59,014 --> 01:48:01,050
Keep the Tesseract on Earth.

1372
01:48:02,117 --> 01:48:03,149
Hidden.

1373
01:48:03,351 --> 01:48:05,187
You sure that's what Marvel would want?

1374
01:48:06,021 --> 01:48:07,120
Mar-Vell.

1375
01:48:07,422 --> 01:48:08,588
That's what I said.

1376
01:48:08,790 --> 01:48:11,391
It's two words. Mar. Vell.

1377
01:48:11,393 --> 01:48:12,393
Mar-Vell.

1378
01:48:12,794 --> 01:48:13,927
Marvel sounds a lot better.

1379
01:48:13,929 --> 01:48:15,329
You know, like the Marvelettes.

1380
01:48:18,630 --> 01:48:23,030
<i>♪ Oh yeah. Oh yes. ♪
♪ Wait a minute mister postman. ♪</i>

1381
01:48:23,431 --> 01:48:25,331
<i>♪ ♪</i>

1382
01:48:25,332 --> 01:48:27,332
<i>♪ Mister postman. ♪</i>

1383
01:48:29,110 --> 01:48:30,477
Not ringing any bells?

1384
01:48:30,478 --> 01:48:32,213
Keep singing.
Maybe it'll come back to me.

1385
01:48:47,596 --> 01:48:48,696
I upgraded it.

1386
01:48:49,698 --> 01:48:52,167
Range should be a couple galaxies,
at least.

1387
01:48:54,769 --> 01:48:57,070
What? You think
I'm gonna crank call you?

1388
01:48:57,072 --> 01:49:00,209
For emergencies only, ok?

1389
01:49:06,614 --> 01:49:07,481
Well...

1390
01:49:08,083 --> 01:49:10,517
if you're ever passing back
through this galaxy...

1391
01:49:10,819 --> 01:49:12,354
be sure to give a brother a shout.

1392
01:49:29,471 --> 01:49:30,806
We got the ketchup stain off.

1393
01:49:36,845 --> 01:49:38,280
Thanks, Lieutenant Trouble.

1394
01:49:47,923 --> 01:49:49,857
It's hard for me to say goodbye, too.

1395
01:50:04,139 --> 01:50:05,173
Go on.

1396
01:51:12,341 --> 01:51:13,809
Glad to have you back, sir.

1397
01:51:14,410 --> 01:51:15,543
This came for you.

1398
01:51:20,081 --> 01:51:21,150
So, is it true?

1399
01:51:22,318 --> 01:51:23,850
That the Kree burned your eye out,

1400
01:51:23,852 --> 01:51:25,620
because you refused
to give them the Tesseract?

1401
01:51:27,122 --> 01:51:30,857
I will neither confirm nor deny
the facts of that story.

1402
01:51:31,059 --> 01:51:32,127
Understood.

1403
01:51:33,762 --> 01:51:35,962
I'm sorry to report that we still
haven't found the Tesseract.

1404
01:51:35,964 --> 01:51:37,798
I'm sure it'll turn up somewhere.

1405
01:51:39,834 --> 01:51:41,234
I'll let you know when it does.

1406
01:51:41,736 --> 01:51:42,738
Then what?

1407
01:51:43,671 --> 01:51:44,671
Sir?

1408
01:51:44,973 --> 01:51:48,909
We have no idea what other
intergalactic threats are out there.

1409
01:51:49,311 --> 01:51:51,512
And our one-woman security force,

1410
01:51:51,513 --> 01:51:52,913
had a prior commitment,

1411
01:51:52,914 --> 01:51:54,616
on the other side of the universe.

1412
01:51:57,386 --> 01:51:59,221
S.H.I.E.L.D. alone can't protect us.

1413
01:52:01,223 --> 01:52:02,789
We need to find more.

1414
01:52:03,091 --> 01:52:04,224
More weapons?

1415
01:52:04,226 --> 01:52:06,025
More heroes.

1416
01:52:06,127 --> 01:52:07,727
You think you can find others like her?

1417
01:52:07,829 --> 01:52:10,132
We found her and
we weren't even looking.

1418
01:52:11,900 --> 01:52:13,034
Get some rest, sir.

1419
01:52:14,203 --> 01:52:15,671
You got a big decision to make.

1420
01:52:49,172 --> 01:52:51,172
By <font color="#ff80ff">L</font><font color="#ff6aff">E</font><font color="#ff5bff">S</font><font color="#ff3cff">A</font><font color="#ff15ff">I</font><font color="#f200f2">G</font><font color="#e100e1">N</font><font color="#cc00cc">E</font><font color="#bb00bb">U</font><font color="#ae00ae">R</font>
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Sync & corrections May 2019</i></font>

1421
01:55:15,217 --> 01:55:16,451
This is a nightmare.

1422
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:20,288
I've had better nightmares.

1423
01:55:23,024 --> 01:55:23,724
Hey.

1424
01:55:25,126 --> 01:55:26,619
So, that thing just...

1425
01:55:26,820 --> 01:55:28,930
stopped doing whatever
the hell it was doing.

1426
01:55:30,965 --> 01:55:32,133
What do we got?

1427
01:55:33,535 --> 01:55:36,135
Whatever signal it was
sending finally crapped out.

1428
01:55:36,137 --> 01:55:37,437
I thought we bypassed the battery.

1429
01:55:37,739 --> 01:55:40,041
We did. It's still plugged in. It just...

1430
01:55:40,242 --> 01:55:41,275
It just stopped.

1431
01:55:42,177 --> 01:55:43,710
Reboot it.
Send the signal again.

1432
01:55:43,912 --> 01:55:45,579
We don't even know what this is.

1433
01:55:45,581 --> 01:55:47,815
Fury did.
Just do it, please.

1434
01:55:48,317 --> 01:55:50,350
