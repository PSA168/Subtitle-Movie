3
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,875
Homage to the Incomparably Blessed One,
the Worthy Undefiled One,

4
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:10,500
the Perfectly Self-Awakened One.

5
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:13,583
Homage to the Incomparably Blessed One,
the Worthy Undefiled One,

6
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,458
the Perfectly Self-Awakened One.

7
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:19,208
Homage to the Incomparably Blessed One,
the Worthy Undefiled One,

8
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,333
the Perfectly Self-Awakened One.

9
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:23,750
Mom, who are you praying to?

10
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,333
Do you know the person in there?

11
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:30,250
I'm praying to sacred beings.

12
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:33,083
I want to stay
in a single burial plot like this.

13
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,958
I doubt they'd grant your wish.

14
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:37,083
It's a million per plot.

15
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:38,000
Mom!

16
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:40,125
Are you ready to go?

17
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,791
Their real family is here.

18
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,791
Yes, just a second.

19
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:49,916
Come on, Mom.

20
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,375
You can stay in a shared plot like this.

21
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,291
Close to your mom and dad.

22
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,541
It's cozy and inexpensive.

23
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:12,916
Mom, don't listen to her.

24
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:15,375
I'll buy it for you.

25
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,166
It's easy to get a million now.

26
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,541
Get away from me.

27
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,250
Your breath smells like cigarettes.

28
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:25,083
Try returning the money I lent you first.

29
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:28,166
How many hundred thousand
do you already owe me, Soei?

30
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,000
I don't know. I don't remember.
I only remember good things.

31
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,500
What selective memory.

32
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:35,000
{\an8}Hey! How dare you cross over it? And you!

33
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,000
{\an8}How many decades
have you been coming here?

34
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:40,500
{\an8}The duck and chicken butts
are all facing my parent's faces.

35
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:41,833
{\an8}How about this then?

36
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,208
M.

37
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,000
M.

38
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:47,958
M.

39
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:51,791
Come and help.

40
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,375
I already helped put the mat down, Mom.

41
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,208
Come on.

42
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,791
How dare you!

43
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,333
The ceremony hasn't started yet.

44
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,541
We're here for the Tomb Sweeping Day,

45
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,583
but all I've seen you do
is play your games.

46
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,250
Come on, Grandma.

47
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,500
At least I came.

48
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,083
Look at Uncle Kiang's family.

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,208
<i>I see. Yes.</i>

50
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,416
- See, I told you. Everyone came.
<i>- All right.</i>

51
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,416
<i>Is it hot?</i>

52
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,041
It's not hot.

53
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,375
Haven't you gotten ready?

54
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,791
Then I'll light an incense stick
for you, okay?

55
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,875
Mom. Here she is.

56
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,375
- That's it--
- Just once a year,

57
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,041
we come to pay respects.

58
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,750
Your wife and daughter
have never shown up.

59
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:49,750
Hold on.

60
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,583
Go scatter them up there.

61
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,833
Look at your face.

62
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,791
GRANDPARENTS
ZHENG YAFANG, ZHOU QINXING

63
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:18,333
Gosh. Look at the job you've done.

64
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,583
Can't you do it nicely?

65
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,916
- It doesn't change anything.
- See?

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,416
My great-grandparents
have risen to the clouds.

67
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,458
You really are a <i>qi chou</i>.

68
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:31,666
What?

69
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,291
{\an8}- "A good-for-nothing."
- Yes.

70
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,791
Mom, come down. You'll fall over.

71
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,125
The wind will scatter them when it blows.

72
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,125
You're stubborn, you know?

73
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,791
Come on down.

74
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,208
She's looking for trouble.

75
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:54,958
Mom!

76
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,541
Mom, come down now.

77
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,000
- Hey, Mom!
- Mom!

78
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,333
The patient's family,
please fill out the form.

79
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:03,250
Sure.

80
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,041
See you, Mom.

81
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,125
Sew, go in and fill out the forms.

82
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,750
Hey, guys.

83
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,708
I've got to go and pick up Rainbow.

84
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,791
Who can stay?
I'll leave some money with you.

85
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,833
My motorbike is at your house, Kiang.

86
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,833
I'll have to go and get my ride first

87
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,083
then come back to stay with Mom.

88
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,583
Are you crazy?
Kiang's house is out in the sticks.

89
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,000
Don't bother running around.

90
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,541
I can look after her.

91
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:30,666
- Really?
- Yes.

92
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,583
Take this.

93
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,250
M.

94
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,250
Uncle Kiang,
are you going to pass the MRT?

95
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,666
Yes.

96
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,000
Can I get a ride with you?

97
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,750
Okay. Here.

98
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,375
- Let's go.
- See you.

99
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,791
I'll leave it to you then.

100
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,666
<i>This place is filled</i>
<i>with talismans, everyone.</i>

101
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,958
Hold up, a ghost!

102
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:07,875
There's a ghost, guys.

103
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,208
Take that!

104
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,541
- Wait, where did it go?
- Are there only four viewers?

105
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,250
Mom, your voice is picked up
by the microphone.

106
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,166
Mom, come sit and rest first.

107
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,916
You've been standing all day.

108
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,833
Have you read my text yet?

109
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,333
You want a new computer for your games

110
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,416
and you want my card details.

111
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,291
Why don't you use your own card?

112
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,833
They're going to cut off my card.

113
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,083
So let it get suspended.

114
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:53,500
If your internet gets cut off again,
I won't pay for it.

115
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:54,500
I don't understand.

116
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:57,166
When you dropped out to be a game caster,

117
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,625
what did you tell me again?

118
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,250
You'd make truckloads of money.

119
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,333
You'd rent your own apartment.

120
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:04,875
You'd also give me an allowance.

121
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,166
I want to retire when I'm 60.

122
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,583
I know.

123
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,375
Don't rub salt into the wound.

124
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,916
Geez.

125
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,916
When Grandma fell over
on Tomb Sweeping Day,

126
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,666
she told the doctor she had stomachaches

127
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,083
and found blood in her stool.

128
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,125
So they did an exam of her intestines.

129
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,875
The results came out this morning.

130
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,333
Grandma has cancer.

131
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,333
It's in the final stage.

132
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:58,416
- The doctor said she has a year left.
- Dead!

133
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,500
Man, I told them to pray first.

134
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,041
Damn it.

135
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,291
Anyway, find time to go visit her.

136
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:11,041
But don't tell her about the cancer.

137
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,750
I don't want her to stress out about it.

138
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,791
Would you hire me to go then?

139
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,708
My time is money.

140
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,458
Goodness.

141
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,208
MUIII: THE TELEVISION IS ACTING UP AGAIN

142
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,875
WHEN YOU HAVE TIME,
CAN YOU COME TAKE A LOOK FOR GRANDPA?

143
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,750
You have to keep updating the application
or it will keep on freezing up.

144
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:43,958
What?

145
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,375
He said you've lost a lot of weight.

146
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:49,541
You need to eat more.

147
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,791
He only made random sounds
and you know what he said?

148
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,208
Actually, I made it up.

149
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,125
He's probably telling you
not to block the TV.

150
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,541
Hey.

151
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,458
Grandpa!

152
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,041
You're still kicking it.

153
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,750
Your diaper is heavy.
I'll change it for you.

154
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:16,708
I'm lowering the bed.

155
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,125
You're like every grandparent's dream,

156
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,125
to have a grandchild
who studied to be a nurse.

157
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,125
Is that true, Grandpa?

158
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,666
Who do you love the most?

159
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:59,541
Come on, Grandpa!

160
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,625
You're hurting my feelings.

161
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,625
You're going to be sleeping alone tonight.

162
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,625
Don't you ever think
about doing something else?

163
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,500
When do you have time for yourself?

164
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,583
Grandpa once told me

165
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,791
to go find some easy,
high-paying work to do.

166
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,125
So why don't you?

167
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:21,958
That's what I'm doing right now.

168
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,500
Here's a pure silver belt.

169
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,041
You can get over 10,000 for it.

170
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,000
Thank you.

171
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:03,250
Your dad is not around anymore.
So Grandpa left it to you instead.

172
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,375
Thank you so much.

173
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,958
I'll take care of it for you.

174
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,083
You might go off and sell it.

175
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,416
Mom.

176
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,625
Grandpa was one smart cookie.
He had already divided the inheritance.

177
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:16,208
He was just waiting for his death
to reveal everything.

178
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:19,250
Leaving a headache
for those left behind like me.

179
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,250
Did Grandpa leave anything else to me?

180
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,958
There isn't anything left.

181
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,875
He left his house to Mui.

182
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:32,666
All your dad's siblings
got only a bit of money.

183
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:12,250
<i>Attention. The train</i>
<i>approaching Talat Phlu station</i>

184
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,375
<i>departed from Mahachai station…</i>

185
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:56,875
Grandma.

186
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:08,416
{\an8}HOW TO MAKE MILLIONS
BEFORE GRANDMA DIES

187
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:27,958
It's so damn ancient.

188
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,708
VINTAGE STYLE SHOP HOUSE
IN TALAT PHLU AREA

189
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,541
NEAR GREAT FOOD,
CONVENIENT TO TRAVEL TO,

190
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,041
AND NEAR MRT STATION

191
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,375
CONTACT: M. THANAPAT

192
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,166
Who's that out in front?

193
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:51,416
Grandma.

194
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,083
It's me, M.

195
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,750
I'm kind of free, so I dropped by.

196
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,375
I miss you.

197
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:02,750
Kiang and Soei also came
to visit just the other day.

198
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:04,666
Really?

199
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,083
What's with all the visits from you all?

200
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,958
I'm here to see how your leg is.

201
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,916
Aren't you happy
your grandson came to visit?

202
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,166
Sure.

203
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,000
What are you doing?

204
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,166
Have you eaten yet?

205
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,625
Here. I've bought some noodles for you.

206
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:27,875
Let's have them together.

207
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:30,875
It's not time for my meal yet.

208
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,166
What kind of noodles did you get?

209
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,250
From that famous beef noodles place.

210
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,166
I remember
that you like to eat offal, right?

211
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,416
There are tendons,

212
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,500
liver, flat iron steak, and tripe.

213
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,708
See? It's really tender.
Let's eat together.

214
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,250
I pray to the goddess Guanyin.

215
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,666
I don't eat beef!

216
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,000
Then what are you going to eat?

217
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,333
Is this some kind
of Michelin-star fried fish?

218
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,166
Do you want fried fish?

219
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,750
It's freshly fried.

220
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,958
Do you want fried fish?

221
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,916
Fried fish?

222
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,541
- It's freshly fried and quite large.
- One, two, three, four, five, six…

223
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,583
Fried fish?

224
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,416
Fried fish? Which one would you like?

225
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,958
My goodness, the fried fish
from the guy's shop looks tasty.

226
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:39,875
Why are you back so fast?

227
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,708
Was the queue for his shop short?

228
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,500
He used two woks, Grandma.

229
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,291
It's a busy day for him.

230
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:55,333
I've been buying from him for 40 years.

231
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:58,041
Do you think you can trick me?

232
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,583
The fish from other shops

233
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,583
absorb a lot of oil.

234
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,041
I'm not eating it.

235
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,083
If you're already eating fried foods,
you don't have to worry about your health.

236
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:18,000
That guy's fried fish is here.
It's piping hot.

237
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,208
Gosh.

238
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,625
I'm already full.

239
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:24,791
What did you eat?

240
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,541
I had the fish you bought me.

241
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,958
Are you boiling water for yourself?

242
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,833
I'm making tea to offer the gods.

243
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,333
Let me take care of it for you.

244
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,666
Did the water finish boiling already?

245
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,666
Of course.

246
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,000
Why didn't I hear the kettle whistle?

247
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,333
I microwaved the water.

248
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,458
Reckless boy!

249
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:27,958
- Gosh!
- What?

250
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,708
Take it down right now!

251
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,083
- Why? Can't you use it? It's--
- Because you can't!

252
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:36,250
- It's faster and saves gas as well.
- Take it down.

253
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,208
You can't use it.

254
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,791
Yes, you can.

255
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,583
It's tea all the same, Grandma.

256
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:45,666
The gods won't say anything
about the water being boiled or not.

257
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,625
{\an8}If you do things just to get them done,
don't do them at all.

258
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,000
I'll come tomorrow
to boil the water for you, okay?

259
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,208
Just leave.

260
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,791
Two kettles tomorrow.

261
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,166
You don't have to come at all.

262
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,625
You usually never come anyway.

263
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,375
Watch where you walk.

264
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,166
Okay, here.

265
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,541
I'm not sure if Ms. Mui meant to leave it.
It'd be a waste to throw it away.

266
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,750
Why are you so stubborn?

267
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,500
I told you that I meant
to throw away those things.

268
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,000
Yet you still brought them to me.

269
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,958
If you're here to ask for money
like the other relatives,

270
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,250
I don't have any.

271
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,500
No, it's not like that.

272
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,208
I…

273
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,791
I think you took great care of Grandpa.

274
00:19:55,875 --> 00:20:00,333
The person who took care of him
should get the inheritance.

275
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,708
Here, I'll carry it for you.

276
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,375
I'm here to talk to you

277
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,625
about that easy

278
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:12,958
and high-paying work

279
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,083
that you did.

280
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,833
<i>I want to save the money</i>
<i>from selling Grandpa's house.</i>

281
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,916
<i>So I'm renting a monthly hotel room.</i>

282
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,166
There's breakfast

283
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,166
and housekeeping.

284
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,083
If I get bored, I can just move out.

285
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,791
Are you working as a nurse now?

286
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:35,958
At which hospital?

287
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,666
That's what I wear
for my OnlyFans account.

288
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,500
Those costumes can fetch a higher fee.

289
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,708
Do you want to subscribe?

290
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,416
It's fine.

291
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,333
What are you embarrassed about?

292
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,208
We've even kissed before.

293
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:01,750
{\an8}When we were kids,

294
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,833
{\an8}when both our parents
used to play cards at Grandpa's,

295
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,416
we used to play house, remember?

296
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,958
I was the mom and you were the dad.

297
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,125
We hugged under the blanket.

298
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,541
Yes,

299
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,791
I remember now, all right?

300
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,666
Why do you want to look
after your grandma?

301
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,875
I want to be able to live on my own.

302
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:32,000
I don't have
the same head start as others.

303
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,250
Some people are born rich.

304
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,541
They have a family business to continue.

305
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,916
So do you think of Grandma as an asset?

306
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:50,541
That hurts.

307
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,208
Is what we're doing…

308
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:00,583
wrong?

309
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:26,291
You know,

310
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,500
I really hate Grandpa's kids.

311
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:31,500
BOONYANUCH GARDEN

312
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,291
They dropped by for a visit
once a week for just 15 minutes.

313
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:37,208
Why bother to come at all?

314
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:42,625
M.

315
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:44,500
Yes?

316
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,166
We don't intend to make them sad.

317
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:52,875
We're giving them happiness.

318
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:04,833
How did you get to be Grandpa's number one

319
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,416
despite being a granddaughter?

320
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,833
Do you know

321
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:13,916
what old people really want,

322
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,333
but will never receive
from their offspring?

323
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:25,208
It's time, M.

324
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,083
But I was already with her all day.

325
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,083
When you visited Grandma,

326
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:41,166
did you smell something strange?

327
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:45,041
Well, old people smell.

328
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,791
That means you haven't been
with her long enough.

329
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:53,750
You have to stay with her
until you don't notice it.

330
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:58,333
I was even unfazed by Grandpa's piss.

331
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:15,416
Gosh!

332
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:36,750
I'll bring you back when I get the money.

333
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:48,541
What has gotten into you?
Why are you staying at Grandma's?

334
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:53,083
Didn't you want me to go there anyway?

335
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:15,250
How did you get in?

336
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:18,500
Mom gave me the keys.

337
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:21,875
What's with all the stuff?

338
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:24,833
Some of it is mine and some I bought.

339
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,291
This is for you, Grandma.

340
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:29,125
I got the money
from selling things online.

341
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:33,916
What's the real reason
you all keep coming here?

342
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,833
If I'm fine,

343
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:40,875
you guys don't need to come!

344
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:57,166
That day Mom took you to the doctor's,

345
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:00,916
he found…

346
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:04,583
that you have cancer.

347
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,041
But Mom and the uncles
don't want you to know.

348
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:16,333
Is it severe?

349
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,625
Stage four.

350
00:26:21,041 --> 00:26:22,416
The doctor said you have a year.

351
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:26,416
But you don't need
to listen to him, you know?

352
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,875
Those doctors like to pretend
they know everything.

353
00:26:28,958 --> 00:26:30,916
Do you remember Auntie Yen
from down the block?

354
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Her doctor said she had half a year.
It's been 10 years already.

355
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:36,250
She's still running around
her five-story house.

356
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:45,416
When I was a kid and lived here,

357
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:47,958
you took care of me for many years.

358
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:52,166
It's now my turn to take care of you.

359
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:56,041
From now on,

360
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:59,583
I want to spend my time with you, Grandma.

361
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:31,041
This money is for the utilities then.

362
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:39,375
I'll help you sell congee tomorrow.

363
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:40,541
What time do you leave?

364
00:27:43,541 --> 00:27:44,666
Five in the morning.

365
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,958
- What?
- Five in the morning!

366
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:48,333
Why so early?

367
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:51,083
Do you expect to sell congee
late in the day?

368
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:54,291
People eat congee at night too.

369
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:57,583
Congee can be eaten all day.

370
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:00,458
Haven't you ever heard?

371
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:03,750
The early bird gets the worm.

372
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:06,250
And haven't you ever heard?

373
00:28:06,958 --> 00:28:10,666
The worm that wakes up early
will be gobbled up first.

374
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,541
The worm that woke up late survives.

375
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:15,125
Throwing scowls, are you?

376
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:02,875
Why didn't you wake me up?

377
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:05,291
Well, I'm not an alarm clock.

378
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:07,791
You do the next bag.

379
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:08,750
Fine.

380
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,500
- Do you know what you're doing?
- Just wait.

381
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:27,250
You can give me the cash
to deposit in the ATM,

382
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,416
so you don't have to walk to the bank.

383
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,583
Stop meddling.

384
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:32,833
I always take this walk every month.

385
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:35,833
Isn't it good
if you don't have to go this month?

386
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:37,166
Ngek.

387
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,208
Ngek.

388
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:40,458
Who?

389
00:29:40,541 --> 00:29:41,416
My friend.

390
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:54,541
Here.

391
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:58,125
Ngek, how are you?

392
00:29:58,208 --> 00:29:59,833
Did they let you come back already?

393
00:29:59,916 --> 00:30:01,750
- Just yesterday.
- I see.

394
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:04,291
The doctor said I was taking up the bed.

395
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,500
I've been hit as well.

396
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:08,625
Where?

397
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:09,833
Intestines.

398
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:11,666
What stage?

399
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:14,083
Four.

400
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:15,375
Same.

401
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:17,083
Well,

402
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,666
you have my support.

403
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,500
But at least you have your grandson
to take care of you.

404
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:23,791
I'm jealous.

405
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:25,708
See?

406
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:28,500
Everyone is envious of you.

407
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,458
SIAM SAVINGS BANK

408
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,541
Stay out here!

409
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,541
You'll use my bank details behind my back.

410
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:40,375
I'm your grandson, not some thief.

411
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:43,083
- Have you watched too much news?
- Whatever. Stay right there.

412
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:45,583
- Hello, ma'am.
- Do you think I'm some kind of scammer?

413
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:46,500
Thank you.

414
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:48,750
- Are you making your usual deposit today?
- Yes.

415
00:30:58,166 --> 00:31:00,458
Mom, this is bad.

416
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:02,375
The fridge smells like a garbage can.

417
00:31:02,458 --> 00:31:05,500
You should throw away
all the expired stuff.

418
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:07,375
It's not expired. I can still eat it.

419
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:11,125
{\an8}You eat this every day.
That's why you got stomachaches.

420
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:14,333
{\an8}Even if you throw it away,
I'll dig it back up.

421
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:18,416
You girls are bickering
so early in the morning.

422
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,416
Why are you sleeping downstairs,
not upstairs?

423
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:25,666
Grandma locks her room.
She won't let me sleep with her.

424
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:39,791
Why are you dressed up so fancy, Grandma?

425
00:31:42,708 --> 00:31:43,958
Fancy?

426
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:44,916
Yes.

427
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:49,250
{\an8}Why didn't you button the last one?
Are you going for sexy?

428
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:50,750
{\an8}Stop it. No need.

429
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:54,291
{\an8}It's too tight. I don't like it!

430
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:55,833
Of course it's tight.

431
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:57,416
Why are you bothering me?

432
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:02,000
Did you steal Rainbow's shoes?
Aren't they too tight?

433
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:04,083
They fit well.

434
00:32:04,791 --> 00:32:06,291
- A perfect fit?
- Yes.

435
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:10,833
{\an8}- Is this a perfect fit?
- Why?

436
00:32:10,916 --> 00:32:12,416
{\an8}Why are you bothering me?

437
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,833
{\an8}You understand
what "perfect fit" means, right?

438
00:32:14,916 --> 00:32:16,583
{\an8}They're my feet.

439
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:20,875
{\an8}If I can wear them, then that's fine.
What about your shoes?

440
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:22,250
{\an8}Perfect as well.

441
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:24,083
So why are you dressed up so nicely?

442
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:26,833
Well, today is Sunday.

443
00:32:29,416 --> 00:32:31,000
Everyone comes.

444
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:33,041
You're the only one
who has never come over.

445
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:52,250
This chicken is
from the famous Montien Hotel, Mother.

446
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:54,333
The one where all the VIPs eat.

447
00:32:57,583 --> 00:32:59,375
You know, Rainbow,

448
00:32:59,458 --> 00:33:02,083
we used to raise a pet chicken downstairs.

449
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:04,125
- Do you like them?
- I like baby chicks.

450
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:06,833
- Small chicks are cute.
- Right?

451
00:33:06,916 --> 00:33:10,250
Your aunt, your dad, and I
used to play with the chicken all day.

452
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:12,583
Until one Chinese New Year,

453
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:14,958
Grandma chopped the chicken.

454
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:16,791
She chopped it

455
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:19,291
and steamed it for us to eat.

456
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:22,416
Who could eat it, right?
So we had to give it to the dogs.

457
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,125
You've got quite a memory.

458
00:33:24,208 --> 00:33:26,125
- Right, Sew?
- Do you remember Kiang would cry

459
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:27,291
until he blew a snot bubble?

460
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:28,666
- Right?
- Hey!

461
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,916
Can you guys stop
telling stupid stories to my girl?

462
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:35,000
Come on, Kiang. It's nothing.

463
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:36,958
They call it passing down knowledge.

464
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:39,541
Hey.

465
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:43,291
When we're done eating,
let's play some cards.

466
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:45,208
We're all here.

467
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:48,208
Well, you're planning to take money
from your kids, right?

468
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:51,000
Go open up the safe.
I'm going to win all your money.

469
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:53,416
I'd like to see you try.

470
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,583
Bring it on!

471
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:58,000
Mom, my family can't stay though.

472
00:33:58,583 --> 00:34:00,750
I have to drop Rainbow off
at her English class.

473
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:02,166
Hey, come on.

474
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,833
She won't be late
if you play a game or two.

475
00:34:04,916 --> 00:34:06,375
- Right, Kiang.
- There's no time.

476
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:07,625
There's traffic as well.

477
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:09,208
Soei, you too.

478
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:11,125
You shouldn't be playing cards with Mom.

479
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:13,416
- Why not?
- You should let her rest.

480
00:34:15,708 --> 00:34:18,458
- Mom, do you still have stomachaches?
- Right.

481
00:34:18,541 --> 00:34:20,083
Does it hurt anywhere?

482
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:22,208
I already know about the cancer.

483
00:34:23,458 --> 00:34:24,291
What?

484
00:34:28,291 --> 00:34:29,791
M told me.

485
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:37,791
Well, it's Grandma's body.

486
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:40,541
I think she has the right to know.

487
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,500
I'll go see the doctor on my own.

488
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:52,208
I won't bother you guys.

489
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:53,375
It's not like that.

490
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:58,166
At first, I wanted you to get treated.

491
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,416
But they didn't agree.

492
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,916
What?

493
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,041
Why are you making yourself look good?

494
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:06,125
You didn't even come
and you didn't pay for anything.

495
00:35:06,208 --> 00:35:08,458
Right, you're bringing up money again.

496
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:10,666
I don't have any. If I did, I would pay.

497
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,041
It's because you don't work.

498
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:13,750
I do. I've got jobs here and there.

499
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:15,583
- Business is slow.
- You don't have to yell.

500
00:35:15,666 --> 00:35:17,375
- I work.
- You aren't any better, Kiang.

501
00:35:17,458 --> 00:35:18,875
- I come when I can.
- You're not free.

502
00:35:18,958 --> 00:35:20,458
Don't I work as well?

503
00:35:20,541 --> 00:35:22,250
Are you saying Soei and I don't work?

504
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:23,250
Yes.

505
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:28,791
When I grow up,

506
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:32,500
I'll study to be a doctor
so I can heal you.

507
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:47,208
It's fine, Mom.

508
00:35:47,291 --> 00:35:49,875
My friend knows a doctor
who treats a lot of hotshots.

509
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:52,458
I'll pay for the treatments myself.
You will get better.

510
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:54,083
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

511
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:56,291
I'll take you to the hospital myself.

512
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:57,875
There's no need to…

513
00:35:57,958 --> 00:35:59,583
It's my duty, Mom.

514
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:03,000
Mom.

515
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:07,541
{\an8}Mom, I just took a dump
and noticed the floor was really slippery.

516
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:10,625
{\an8}I'll install a handrail
for you to hold onto. Okay?

517
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,250
Thank you, all of you.

518
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:20,625
Come on. No need to be dramatic.

519
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:22,541
You'll be fine.

520
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:27,666
Don't you have a shift
at the supermarket today?

521
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,666
No.

522
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,458
I already changed to the night shift.

523
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:33,250
So I can take Grandma
to chemotherapy treatments during the day.

524
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:35,250
I can't take five to six days off.

525
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:47,250
Are you expecting anything?

526
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:53,000
Expecting what?

527
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,250
My mom is sick.

528
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:57,333
Don't you think I should look after her?

529
00:36:57,416 --> 00:37:00,041
Otherwise, people might say
I'm an ungrateful child.

530
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:08,916
I'm coming here only this one time.

531
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,250
I'm not coming back again.

532
00:37:11,166 --> 00:37:14,833
Don't you remember what the doctor said?
He told you to exercise often.

533
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,875
I can walk on my own.

534
00:37:19,041 --> 00:37:21,333
See? You had to take a day off from work.

535
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:23,125
They'll fire you.

536
00:37:26,416 --> 00:37:27,750
Don't worry, Grandma.

537
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:29,958
Mom changed to the night shift already.

538
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:31,708
So she can take you to the doctor.

539
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:33,958
I see.

540
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:36,791
Have you already changed your shift?

541
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:39,583
What time do you get off work?

542
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:42,875
What time?

543
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:46,375
In the morning, Grandma.
She works at night.

544
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:47,375
I see!

545
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:50,375
Does that mean you haven't slept yet?

546
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:53,708
I'm getting out.
I don't want to do this anymore.

547
00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:55,708
Why would you get out now?

548
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:58,833
Can't you let me do
something nice for you?

549
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:01,750
Every time you want to do
something nice for me,

550
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:03,208
it always causes me trouble.

551
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:06,458
When you quit school
to help me sell congee…

552
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:09,250
What did I do wrong?

553
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:12,125
I didn't want to lie around useless
like Kiang and Soei

554
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:14,041
and let you break your back

555
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,416
- selling congee every day.
- How did that turn out?

556
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,416
Look at you breaking your back
working harder than me now.

557
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,750
If it were Kiang bringing you here,
you'd be fine with it?

558
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:25,041
Sure! I'll tell him for you.

559
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,875
But who knows if he'll be free to do so.

560
00:38:45,416 --> 00:38:47,291
Grandma is crying in the restroom.

561
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,541
That's impossible.

562
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:55,083
She never shed a tear for me.

563
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:01,000
True.

564
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:04,041
You're always the one who sheds tears.

565
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:09,708
The more you fight,
the more she gets stressed out.

566
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:17,166
Let me take Grandma to her chemotherapy.

567
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:21,375
Just think of me as your representative.

568
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:37,083
{\an8}- Have you turned off the lights already?
- Yes, I have.

569
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,000
{\an8}- Both downstairs and upstairs?
- Yes.

570
00:39:42,166 --> 00:39:43,083
Mui.

571
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,416
Grandma, this is Mui.

572
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,666
My cousin.

573
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,291
Grandma, have you eaten yet?

574
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:50,416
I have.

575
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,791
Where are you going, Grandma?

576
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:58,833
I'm going to see the doctor.

577
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,500
I'm going to drive you there.

578
00:40:06,291 --> 00:40:07,750
Thank you.

579
00:40:11,916 --> 00:40:13,250
Do you speak Teochew?

580
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:15,875
Hey!

581
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:19,458
You owe me one, okay?

582
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:20,583
Yes.

583
00:40:28,916 --> 00:40:32,291
M, leave your shoes to reserve a spot.
They'll be taking patients at eight.

584
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,666
We even woke up at four.

585
00:40:36,416 --> 00:40:38,333
Let's find a place to sit, Grandma.

586
00:40:42,291 --> 00:40:43,375
Wait for me here.

587
00:40:43,458 --> 00:40:44,958
I'll go get a wheelchair for you.

588
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:31,291
Next time, go in and sit with her.

589
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:35,791
This is when you can rake up your score.

590
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,083
It's burning hot inside, like I'm on fire.

591
00:41:55,666 --> 00:41:58,041
Go put the money away.

592
00:41:58,125 --> 00:41:59,416
- In the cabinet.
- Sure.

593
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:12,416
Wait, Grandma. I'll help you up.

594
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,166
No. No way.

595
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:16,833
When you were a kid,
you asked me to hold your hand.

596
00:42:16,916 --> 00:42:19,916
But your eyes were glued
to the television.

597
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,750
I fell down the stairs because of you.

598
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,708
I don't remember it.

599
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:27,250
- I'd rather climb the stairs on my own.
- Come on.

600
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:28,750
Stretch out both of your arms.

601
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:31,500
Mui said when I help you up the stairs,

602
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:33,416
I should stand above you
so you won't fall over.

603
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,416
Are you sure?

604
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,083
Yes. Come on.

605
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:38,083
- Give me your hands.
- If I fall down again…

606
00:42:46,916 --> 00:42:48,250
Be careful. Slowly.

607
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:53,916
Get some rest.

608
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,375
Is this Uncle Soei?

609
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:04,208
Yes.

610
00:43:07,416 --> 00:43:08,291
Hilarious.

611
00:43:18,833 --> 00:43:19,708
Grandma.

612
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,375
You and Grandpa were quite the cool kids
back in the day.

613
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,291
When you were a kid,

614
00:43:29,291 --> 00:43:30,916
you were afraid of ghosts.

615
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:35,958
You'd sleep between me
and Grandpa every night.

616
00:43:36,041 --> 00:43:37,541
Me? Afraid of ghosts?

617
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:42,250
I had to sing a lullaby
to get you to sleep.

618
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:43,166
Nonsense.

619
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,916
It's good you're not afraid anymore.

620
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:52,166
Because Grandpa likes to walk around
downstairs every night.

621
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:54,583
If you see him,

622
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:55,916
don't say anything.

623
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:11,625
Shit!

624
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:16,291
{\an8}I thought you said you weren't afraid.

625
00:44:17,333 --> 00:44:19,291
{\an8}What are you doing in the dark?

626
00:44:21,541 --> 00:44:22,958
I'm praying.

627
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:31,333
I dreamt of my parents.

628
00:44:31,416 --> 00:44:34,083
They came to take me to stay with them.

629
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:38,416
M…

630
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:42,041
I'm about to die, aren't I?

631
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:54,125
Come on, Grandma.

632
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:56,708
You've prayed to the goddess.

633
00:44:57,625 --> 00:44:59,416
You haven't eaten beef for decades.

634
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,416
How many cows were saved because of you?

635
00:45:03,375 --> 00:45:05,458
You're not going to die that easily.
Trust me.

636
00:45:15,458 --> 00:45:17,916
Well, I'm going back to bed then.

637
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,458
- Hey, no need.
- You sleep…

638
00:45:20,541 --> 00:45:21,791
You sleep here.

639
00:45:21,875 --> 00:45:23,416
There's no need to tire yourself.

640
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:26,625
Let's go inside the mosquito net together.

641
00:45:38,583 --> 00:45:41,083
Do you mind sharing the space?

642
00:45:41,166 --> 00:45:42,333
Scoot over, will you?

643
00:45:56,083 --> 00:45:57,500
I <i>"zoi sia" </i>you.

644
00:46:00,375 --> 00:46:01,750
Are you cursing me?

645
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:05,333
I said, "Thank you."

646
00:46:05,416 --> 00:46:07,625
How are you Chinese?

647
00:46:07,708 --> 00:46:09,583
You can't understand a single word.

648
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:12,375
I'm a Thai-speaking Chinese.
A Chinese-Thai.

649
00:46:13,166 --> 00:46:15,208
- Whatever, I'm going to sleep now.
- All right.

650
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,333
Goodnight.

651
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:26,291
Grandma, lullaby, please.

652
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:31,166
Keep doing this whenever you're free.

653
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:35,083
- Sure thing. You'll be out of a job.
- You're not doing it tight enough.

654
00:46:35,708 --> 00:46:38,125
If it's too tight,
the vinegar will suffocate.

655
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,458
The counter is open.

656
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:51,125
Grandma, come on. Let's go.

657
00:46:55,166 --> 00:46:56,375
Grandma, are you ready?

658
00:46:56,958 --> 00:46:58,041
Just a second.

659
00:47:02,041 --> 00:47:02,958
Grandma.

660
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:08,291
Grandma.

661
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,458
What's wrong?

662
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:13,583
- Gosh.
- Hold on, stop.

663
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:16,666
Wait.

664
00:47:18,541 --> 00:47:19,500
My goodness.

665
00:47:21,958 --> 00:47:23,541
Let's not go sell congee today.

666
00:47:25,125 --> 00:47:26,833
Let's go upstairs. I'll give you a bath.

667
00:47:26,916 --> 00:47:28,416
I can go sell it.

668
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,583
Come on, let me give you a sponge bath.

669
00:47:31,666 --> 00:47:33,250
Be careful. Take it slow.

670
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:34,500
I'll help you.

671
00:47:35,166 --> 00:47:37,208
One, two, three.

672
00:47:37,291 --> 00:47:38,125
Come.

673
00:47:53,916 --> 00:47:55,625
All right. Arms.

674
00:48:03,541 --> 00:48:05,000
Wipe underneath as well.

675
00:48:05,083 --> 00:48:07,000
Wait! Hold up! What are you doing?

676
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:10,500
Wipe my body as well. I'm all sticky.

677
00:48:11,333 --> 00:48:13,208
I'm old, you know. I'm not embarrassed.

678
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:16,625
Give me one second. I've never done this.

679
00:48:16,708 --> 00:48:18,666
Let me prepare myself first.

680
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:26,333
My goodness.

681
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:29,500
What are you sighing about?

682
00:48:30,125 --> 00:48:31,500
Shit!

683
00:48:31,583 --> 00:48:32,958
What's wrong with you?

684
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:36,166
Was that bump your nipple?

685
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:38,166
Are you crazy?

686
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,583
It's my mole!

687
00:48:41,041 --> 00:48:43,750
Whose boobs would sag
all the way down there?

688
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:45,250
How would I know?

689
00:48:45,333 --> 00:48:47,833
My boobs aren't that saggy.

690
00:48:52,291 --> 00:48:53,416
What's with the camera?

691
00:48:54,166 --> 00:48:55,416
To watch things.

692
00:48:56,375 --> 00:48:58,041
Watch what?

693
00:48:58,125 --> 00:48:59,541
To watch you, Grandma.

694
00:48:59,625 --> 00:49:02,083
If you faint, I can help you in time.

695
00:49:02,166 --> 00:49:04,666
If you turn into Sleeping Beauty,

696
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,750
it'll be hard
to find a prince to kiss you.

697
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:08,083
Are you cursing me?

698
00:49:08,166 --> 00:49:09,458
I'm not.

699
00:49:09,541 --> 00:49:10,750
{\an8}Here, check it out.

700
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,708
Hey!

701
00:49:18,375 --> 00:49:21,375
How could you move the goddess?

702
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,333
- Why?
- You can't!

703
00:49:24,666 --> 00:49:26,750
Move her back right now.

704
00:49:26,833 --> 00:49:28,083
Do it now.

705
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:30,750
How could you, M?

706
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:34,083
- Done.
- No! Do it again.

707
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:35,250
Do it nicely.

708
00:49:35,333 --> 00:49:37,250
Use both of your hands.

709
00:49:37,333 --> 00:49:39,791
Move her carefully.

710
00:49:39,875 --> 00:49:41,750
{\an8}Done. Right back in the same spot.

711
00:49:41,833 --> 00:49:43,583
{\an8}It's as if she was never moved.

712
00:49:43,666 --> 00:49:45,875
GUANYIN

713
00:49:51,916 --> 00:49:52,833
All right, done.

714
00:49:52,916 --> 00:49:55,291
It's easy. Sit and walk easily.

715
00:49:57,041 --> 00:49:57,916
Done?

716
00:49:58,583 --> 00:50:00,791
Mom, move away.
You hate the smell of cigarettes.

717
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:02,750
Why are you hanging around here?

718
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,416
Mom.

719
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,666
The pomegranate is looking nice.
Let me have it.

720
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:23,916
Leave it alone.

721
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,916
I want it. I don't care.

722
00:50:26,541 --> 00:50:27,708
It's not yours!

723
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:29,791
What? Gosh.

724
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:31,166
Soei!

725
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:34,333
- Why are you so protective of them?
- Because they aren't yours.

726
00:50:36,958 --> 00:50:39,625
- What?
- You're keeping it for your favorite son,

727
00:50:39,708 --> 00:50:41,333
Mr. Kiang, right?

728
00:50:41,416 --> 00:50:43,625
What's there to eat?

729
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:44,791
Go take a look.

730
00:50:49,666 --> 00:50:50,916
Hey, M.

731
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:51,916
Did you know?

732
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,916
Grandma used to call Kiang's wife a dud.

733
00:50:57,416 --> 00:50:58,875
A dud? What do you mean?

734
00:51:01,083 --> 00:51:01,916
You…

735
00:51:02,583 --> 00:51:06,083
Didn't you go to school?
What did you learn there?

736
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:09,208
A dud is what you call
something that's blemished.

737
00:51:09,291 --> 00:51:10,416
No one wants it.

738
00:51:11,041 --> 00:51:12,541
- Really?
- Yes.

739
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,000
When Pinn was able to latch on to Kiang,

740
00:51:16,083 --> 00:51:19,333
Kiang changed into
a totally different person, you know?

741
00:51:19,416 --> 00:51:21,250
He became posher.

742
00:51:21,333 --> 00:51:22,875
Stretching his neck.

743
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:25,041
Sending his kid
to an international school.

744
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:26,750
- Did you know?
- Soei.

745
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,500
- He took out a loan--
- When you drink,

746
00:51:28,583 --> 00:51:29,791
- you have no filter.
- What?

747
00:51:29,875 --> 00:51:31,791
What? I haven't finished gossiping yet.

748
00:51:33,125 --> 00:51:34,500
She's protective of her son.

749
00:51:35,875 --> 00:51:37,541
All right, I won't say another word.

750
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:43,250
{\an8}You know, my motto is
"live within your means."

751
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:45,750
Unlike him. No matter how much
he has, it's not enough.

752
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:48,458
- That's enough.
- He should give to those in need instead.

753
00:51:48,541 --> 00:51:49,541
Don't you agree?

754
00:51:51,083 --> 00:51:53,208
Anyway, do you have a thousand on you now?

755
00:51:53,291 --> 00:51:54,125
No!

756
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:55,416
- Where is it?
- I don't have it.

757
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,875
- If I find it, I'll take it.
- No.

758
00:51:56,958 --> 00:51:58,375
- Just one thousand.
- No.

759
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,541
- One thousand.
- I don't have any!

760
00:52:00,625 --> 00:52:02,625
- I'm going to keep on kissing you.
- Gosh!

761
00:52:10,166 --> 00:52:11,500
When it comes to Soei,

762
00:52:11,583 --> 00:52:13,208
it's best if he doesn't come.

763
00:52:14,166 --> 00:52:15,041
Why?

764
00:52:17,125 --> 00:52:19,583
If he doesn't come,
it means he's doing fine.

765
00:52:26,875 --> 00:52:28,416
That's how it is, M.

766
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,375
They're her kids, we're the grandkids.

767
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:32,333
They've been loved
long before you came along.

768
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:36,041
So can you rank yourself?

769
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:37,875
Who does Grandma love the most right now?

770
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:43,125
Number one goes to
either Uncle Kiang or Uncle Soei.

771
00:52:43,208 --> 00:52:46,000
One plays the stock market,
while the other plays around.

772
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:48,000
As for me,
I've probably moved up over my mom.

773
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,416
Being number three
doesn't get you anything.

774
00:52:55,458 --> 00:52:58,208
Back then, how did you know
you were already number one?

775
00:52:58,291 --> 00:53:00,958
- Did Grandpa tell you?
- Old people won't tell you directly.

776
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:04,208
You can feel it.

777
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:07,750
Feel it?

778
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,333
I can't feel anything at all.

779
00:53:10,416 --> 00:53:12,375
I can only feel words cutting at me.

780
00:53:12,458 --> 00:53:13,416
Every single day.

781
00:53:23,541 --> 00:53:26,416
It was probably when Grandpa
told the other relatives about me.

782
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,041
How I took good care of him.

783
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:30,041
I guess.

784
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:36,291
We're almost there, Mom.

785
00:53:37,041 --> 00:53:38,791
It's a bit far, but the air is better.

786
00:53:49,416 --> 00:53:51,416
I'm sorry for never bringing you here.

787
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,791
<i>Welcome home, Grandma.</i>

788
00:53:59,875 --> 00:54:01,541
Hello, Mother.

789
00:54:02,208 --> 00:54:04,291
Show Grandma the picture you drew, honey.

790
00:54:08,708 --> 00:54:09,541
Come on.

791
00:54:28,166 --> 00:54:30,125
{\an8}Grandma, do you like it?

792
00:54:30,208 --> 00:54:31,208
{\an8}I do.

793
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,083
{\an8}It's pretty.

794
00:54:34,166 --> 00:54:35,541
Mom, have you seen the bed?

795
00:54:35,625 --> 00:54:38,916
Rainbow chose the pillows
and blanket herself.

796
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,416
The television is connected
to the internet.

797
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,333
You can watch Chinese operas all day.

798
00:54:45,708 --> 00:54:47,541
But I have to take care of my place.

799
00:54:47,625 --> 00:54:48,750
Come on, Mom.

800
00:54:48,833 --> 00:54:51,666
That house is really old.
Living here is much more convenient.

801
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:53,791
There are restaurants,
a hair and nail salon.

802
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:55,625
There's also a senior citizen club.

803
00:54:55,708 --> 00:54:57,500
They do tai chi every day.

804
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:05,333
But Grandma has to do
her chemotherapy, Uncle Kiang.

805
00:55:05,958 --> 00:55:07,500
It's not wise to travel around.

806
00:55:08,833 --> 00:55:12,458
Well, I trade stocks at home,
so I can look after her around the clock.

807
00:55:12,541 --> 00:55:14,291
But how will she sell her congee?

808
00:55:14,375 --> 00:55:17,500
The customers are already complaining
that she has been taking Sundays off.

809
00:55:17,583 --> 00:55:20,083
Actually, I want her
to stop selling congee already.

810
00:55:20,166 --> 00:55:21,791
I have money.

811
00:55:21,875 --> 00:55:24,666
Come stay here.
I'll take her to chemotherapy myself.

812
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:26,166
But this place is so far away.

813
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:28,833
Wouldn't she have to wake up
at two in the morning then?

814
00:55:51,375 --> 00:55:52,250
M.

815
00:55:53,625 --> 00:55:54,500
M.

816
00:55:56,166 --> 00:55:57,166
Yes?

817
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:59,083
I really appreciate you.

818
00:55:59,166 --> 00:56:00,333
Here.

819
00:56:00,416 --> 00:56:03,166
For the time you spent these past months
taking care of Grandma.

820
00:56:08,458 --> 00:56:10,250
It's fine, Uncle Kiang.

821
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:13,250
I'm not doing it for the money.

822
00:56:28,666 --> 00:56:29,625
Mom.

823
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:32,666
I've only heard that children
should look after their mom.

824
00:56:33,458 --> 00:56:35,416
How can I let my nephew do it?

825
00:56:43,416 --> 00:56:44,250
Mom.

826
00:56:45,625 --> 00:56:47,500
I want to be your full-time son.

827
00:57:11,708 --> 00:57:14,916
- Have you locked up?
- I have.

828
00:57:17,625 --> 00:57:19,125
Rainbow.

829
00:57:19,208 --> 00:57:22,750
Go ask Grandma if she's enjoying herself.

830
00:57:22,833 --> 00:57:24,458
I want to know if she's having fun.

831
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:26,083
- Could you?
- Sure.

832
00:57:28,708 --> 00:57:31,333
- Grandma, are you enjoying yourself?
- Of course I am.

833
00:57:31,416 --> 00:57:33,833
- How about you, Rainbow?
- I'm having fun too.

834
00:57:35,416 --> 00:57:37,208
My beautiful granddaughter.

835
00:57:37,291 --> 00:57:39,750
This temple accepts donations
for coffins, Mother.

836
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:41,250
It's very sacred.

837
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:45,708
My friend just paid a visit recently
and her condition improved in no time.

838
00:57:46,833 --> 00:57:48,583
Mom, taking the train is good, right?

839
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:50,000
Just like when we were kids.

840
00:57:50,083 --> 00:57:52,875
It brings back memories of
when you and Dad took us on train trips.

841
00:57:52,958 --> 00:57:55,250
- You were really small then.
- Me?

842
00:57:55,333 --> 00:57:56,416
You.

843
00:57:57,041 --> 00:57:58,458
Did Soei keep running around?

844
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:00,166
Of course. All three of you did.

845
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:05,166
<i>May you all be blessed</i>

846
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:07,500
<i>- for coming out here for a visit…</i>
- Seven.

847
00:58:08,458 --> 00:58:09,750
Eight.

848
00:58:11,333 --> 00:58:12,833
Nine.

849
00:58:13,416 --> 00:58:15,458
Mom, are you good to climb up?

850
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:18,041
- Eleven.
- Uncle, you can go first.

851
00:58:18,125 --> 00:58:19,291
I'll take care of her.

852
00:58:19,375 --> 00:58:20,791
Twelve.

853
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:23,958
Thirteen.

854
00:58:24,041 --> 00:58:24,958
Have you figured out

855
00:58:25,041 --> 00:58:27,250
whether you're going to live
at your place or Uncle's?

856
00:58:27,333 --> 00:58:28,541
Be quiet, will you?

857
00:58:29,125 --> 00:58:31,583
I'm counting the steps.
You're making me forget it all.

858
00:58:31,666 --> 00:58:32,666
Why are you counting?

859
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,250
For the lottery.

860
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,166
Gosh.

861
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:41,333
Does it hurt?

862
00:58:42,666 --> 00:58:43,583
Come on.

863
00:58:43,666 --> 00:58:46,791
Back in the day,
when Kiang was just a kid,

864
00:58:46,875 --> 00:58:49,208
we came here to pray.

865
00:58:50,208 --> 00:58:52,958
When we were done, his shoes got stolen.

866
00:58:54,166 --> 00:58:57,916
I had to give him my shoes,
so he could walk back home.

867
00:58:58,625 --> 00:59:01,333
That day, the sun was just
as bright as today.

868
00:59:01,416 --> 00:59:03,708
The ground was just as hot as today too.

869
00:59:03,791 --> 00:59:06,000
So was it Uncle Kiang
who bought you these shoes?

870
00:59:12,875 --> 00:59:14,500
See?

871
00:59:15,083 --> 00:59:16,708
All right.

872
00:59:16,791 --> 00:59:17,875
- Come.
- So?

873
00:59:17,958 --> 00:59:21,291
"May I, Mrs. Mengju Saejiew…"

874
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:24,958
Mom, I'll go paste the labels
and wait for you outside.

875
00:59:26,958 --> 00:59:28,833
- And?
- "Recover from illness."

876
00:59:32,916 --> 00:59:34,583
- All right.
- That's not all.

877
00:59:34,666 --> 00:59:36,208
Where are you off in a rush to?

878
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:38,625
What's with the wishes?

879
00:59:39,583 --> 00:59:42,833
"May my oldest son,

880
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:48,625
daughter,

881
00:59:51,708 --> 00:59:53,708
and youngest son…

882
00:59:57,291 --> 00:59:59,083
be healthy and strong,

883
01:00:01,458 --> 01:00:02,875
be wealthy in money and gold."

884
01:00:02,958 --> 01:00:06,166
Gosh. With all these wishes,
we'll need another label.

885
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:08,541
Then write smaller.

886
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:13,666
"And I ask for my grandson…

887
01:00:25,458 --> 01:00:27,750
to have a good job."

888
01:00:37,083 --> 01:00:38,458
Okay.

889
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:40,333
- I'll go paste it for you.
- All right.

890
01:00:49,291 --> 01:00:50,958
Grandma, look. One.

891
01:00:51,041 --> 01:00:52,750
KIANG: MAY MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER BE HAPPY

892
01:00:52,833 --> 01:00:53,666
Two.

893
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,416
RAINBOW: MAY I STAY
AT THE SAME SCHOOL WITH MY FRIENDS

894
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,333
Three.

895
01:00:57,416 --> 01:00:58,583
PINN: MAY I HAVE WEALTH

896
01:00:58,666 --> 01:01:00,625
No one asked for a wish for you.

897
01:01:01,875 --> 01:01:04,625
I think Uncle Kiang
doesn't really want you to live with him.

898
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:06,875
He's just sowing the seeds,
hoping to reap them later.

899
01:01:09,458 --> 01:01:11,083
Well, he has a family.

900
01:01:11,166 --> 01:01:13,875
He has to think of his family first.

901
01:01:33,416 --> 01:01:35,083
Are you not his family, Grandma?

902
01:01:56,583 --> 01:01:57,916
MAY I RECOVER FROM ILLNESS

903
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,708
MAY MY OLDEST SON,
DAUGHTER, AND YOUNGEST SON

904
01:01:59,791 --> 01:02:01,291
BE HEALTHY AND STRONG, AND WEALTHY

905
01:02:01,375 --> 01:02:05,416
AND I ASK FOR MY GRANDSON
TO HAVE THE BEST JOB IN THE WORLD

906
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:12,500
M: MAY GRANDMA WIN THE LOTTERY

907
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:24,166
Mom.

908
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:27,166
Get your things ready
for next Sunday, okay?

909
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:28,666
I'll arrange the car to pick you up.

910
01:03:01,041 --> 01:03:02,166
M.

911
01:03:03,791 --> 01:03:05,625
My feet hurt.

912
01:03:07,375 --> 01:03:09,041
I want to change my shoes.

913
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:25,916
{\an8}Try these on first.

914
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:33,375
{\an8}How are they?

915
01:03:33,458 --> 01:03:34,708
{\an8}A bit too loose.

916
01:03:34,791 --> 01:03:36,250
{\an8}- Loose?
- Yes.

917
01:03:38,083 --> 01:03:39,125
{\an8}That's good.

918
01:03:39,208 --> 01:03:41,083
{\an8}This time you'll get the right size.

919
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:43,416
M.

920
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,750
Yes?

921
01:03:44,833 --> 01:03:47,666
You're also sowing seeds
in hopes of reaping them, aren't you?

922
01:03:55,791 --> 01:03:56,875
I'm

923
01:03:57,875 --> 01:03:59,250
just like Uncle Kiang.

924
01:04:03,416 --> 01:04:05,375
I want to be your full-time grandson.

925
01:04:08,291 --> 01:04:11,291
You're just so full of it.

926
01:04:12,375 --> 01:04:14,041
"You're just so full of it."

927
01:04:14,125 --> 01:04:15,625
If you don't believe me, that's fine.

928
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,208
Which ones do you want to try on next?

929
01:04:19,125 --> 01:04:21,458
{\an8}Let's try one side each
to see which one you like more.

930
01:04:42,333 --> 01:04:43,791
What are you doing?

931
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,250
Look, aren't you pretty?

932
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:50,666
{\an8}You're back
to being your beautiful self, see?

933
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:53,750
{\an8}Gosh. You're obsessed
about your looks too, right?

934
01:04:55,875 --> 01:04:57,500
After your treatment ends,

935
01:04:58,708 --> 01:05:00,875
you'll look kind of like this.

936
01:05:02,041 --> 01:05:03,208
What?

937
01:05:03,291 --> 01:05:04,833
Nonsense.

938
01:05:04,916 --> 01:05:07,166
What? Don't you think you look cool?

939
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:08,750
You do look cool.

940
01:05:08,833 --> 01:05:11,958
You don't have to wake up early
to curl your hair anymore.

941
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:16,958
Do you like it?

942
01:05:19,041 --> 01:05:19,875
Yes.

943
01:05:21,791 --> 01:05:23,833
All right, get some rest.

944
01:05:23,916 --> 01:05:25,000
Rest up.

945
01:05:27,375 --> 01:05:28,541
Close your eyes.

946
01:06:24,166 --> 01:06:26,250
I want some pork. Give me more pork.

947
01:06:26,833 --> 01:06:28,375
- Do you only want pork?
- The pork belly

948
01:06:28,458 --> 01:06:29,791
and some vegetables too.

949
01:06:29,875 --> 01:06:33,250
- You said you wanted only pork.
- I meant give me a lot of pork!

950
01:06:33,333 --> 01:06:35,375
Fine. A lot of pork.

951
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:46,500
Watch and learn. Keep stirring.

952
01:06:46,583 --> 01:06:47,750
Later on,

953
01:06:47,833 --> 01:06:49,458
you can sell congee in my place.

954
01:06:49,541 --> 01:06:52,291
I can't wake up at four
in the morning every day, Grandma.

955
01:06:52,958 --> 01:06:54,458
{\an8}Can I sell late at night?

956
01:06:54,541 --> 01:06:56,000
Don't you forget,

957
01:06:56,083 --> 01:06:58,166
every kind of work

958
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:00,625
leads to the birth of a winner,
<i>zhuangyuan</i>.

959
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,583
All you need to do is be good at it.

960
01:07:05,666 --> 01:07:08,916
Then you can live comfortably.

961
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,375
Just like those <i>zhuangyuans</i>.

962
01:07:12,416 --> 01:07:14,500
But don't they have to be castrated?

963
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:17,666
That's eunuchs!

964
01:07:18,791 --> 01:07:21,166
You're messing things up.

965
01:07:22,541 --> 01:07:24,458
I'm going to defeat you.

966
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:25,458
Try me.

967
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,208
All right.

968
01:07:28,166 --> 01:07:29,041
Bring it on.

969
01:07:31,125 --> 01:07:32,875
Well.

970
01:07:32,958 --> 01:07:34,041
In this round,

971
01:07:34,125 --> 01:07:35,666
will Madam Ju from Talat Phlu

972
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:38,291
be able to bluff a win with this hand?

973
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:39,916
Just be quiet, will you?

974
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,041
You're jinxing my cards.

975
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:43,500
- Let me see.
- No.

976
01:07:45,083 --> 01:07:48,500
Uncle Soei must inherit
his gambler's blood from you.

977
01:07:48,583 --> 01:07:51,750
Well, on the Chinese New Year
and the Ghost Festival,

978
01:07:52,666 --> 01:07:56,083
we didn't know what else to do
after the rituals.

979
01:07:56,958 --> 01:07:59,416
So we'd gather around and play cards.

980
01:08:01,791 --> 01:08:04,583
Are you lonely?
You've lived by yourself for many years.

981
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:07,375
Lonely? I don't know about that.

982
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:08,958
This is just how life is.

983
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:16,791
But I don't like the day
after the Chinese New Year.

984
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,375
The fridge would be bursting
with leftovers.

985
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,666
And I've…

986
01:08:27,041 --> 01:08:28,125
Well…

987
01:08:29,166 --> 01:08:31,375
I've got to eat it all by myself.

988
01:08:35,791 --> 01:08:36,916
Let's play cards.

989
01:08:38,208 --> 01:08:40,000
- Here, my cards
- Okay.

990
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:42,541
Seven with double <i>deng</i>.

991
01:08:47,166 --> 01:08:48,041
{\an8}Show yours.

992
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,208
{\an8}I've got eight with double <i>deng</i>.

993
01:08:52,125 --> 01:08:54,375
{\an8}What? It's six, not eight.

994
01:08:54,458 --> 01:08:56,291
{\an8}It's doubled
because I got a pair of eights.

995
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:01,041
Are you sure you're not being cheated on
when you sell congee?

996
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:03,666
And I have this extra one.

997
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:04,833
What?

998
01:09:04,916 --> 01:09:06,583
Just give in. I won.

999
01:09:06,666 --> 01:09:07,500
- Give me.
- What?

1000
01:09:07,583 --> 01:09:09,708
Cough up 20 baht from that basket.

1001
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,083
What is this?

1002
01:09:12,166 --> 01:09:13,833
You can rob even your grandma.

1003
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:15,125
What?

1004
01:09:15,208 --> 01:09:17,458
I never complain when you take mine.

1005
01:09:17,541 --> 01:09:18,916
All right, another round?

1006
01:09:20,708 --> 01:09:22,166
It's good to have you around.

1007
01:09:25,666 --> 01:09:26,708
It's fun.

1008
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:38,875
Come on. Let's continue playing.

1009
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:40,875
Sure.

1010
01:09:46,625 --> 01:09:48,500
- This time, it's a real game.
- Sure.

1011
01:09:52,208 --> 01:09:53,541
Uncle Kiang isn't answering.

1012
01:09:53,625 --> 01:09:56,208
He's probably upset you didn't move in.

1013
01:09:56,291 --> 01:09:57,958
Uncle Soei turned off his phone.

1014
01:09:58,583 --> 01:10:01,666
As for Mom, she said the supermarket
is short-staffed today.

1015
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:03,708
No one is probably coming today, Grandma.

1016
01:10:07,416 --> 01:10:09,750
Then put the food away in the cabinet.

1017
01:10:09,833 --> 01:10:11,333
Or else the bugs will get to it.

1018
01:10:32,041 --> 01:10:33,208
The lid is loose.

1019
01:10:35,458 --> 01:10:38,125
{\an8}Hey! What happened to all my money?
It's all gone.

1020
01:10:38,208 --> 01:10:39,666
{\an8}- M!
- What?

1021
01:10:44,416 --> 01:10:45,500
How did it go missing?

1022
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,333
It wasn't me.

1023
01:10:51,208 --> 01:10:52,375
I didn't take it.

1024
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:56,875
I didn't, seriously.

1025
01:10:58,625 --> 01:10:59,458
See?

1026
01:11:03,791 --> 01:11:06,041
Not only did he nab the pork floss,
but also the money.

1027
01:11:06,916 --> 01:11:08,708
No wonder he went missing.

1028
01:11:12,625 --> 01:11:13,875
How much did he take?

1029
01:11:41,708 --> 01:11:42,625
Shit!

1030
01:11:44,583 --> 01:11:47,125
<i>Damn you!</i>
<i>Have you ever helped Grandma sell congee?</i>

1031
01:11:47,208 --> 01:11:49,166
She only earns about 10 to 20 baht a bag.

1032
01:11:49,958 --> 01:11:53,083
Just how many bags
does she have to sell to get 200,000?

1033
01:11:54,166 --> 01:11:56,041
Do you even have a conscience?

1034
01:11:56,125 --> 01:11:58,666
Even Grandma
has never told me off like this.

1035
01:12:00,458 --> 01:12:01,625
How much do you owe?

1036
01:12:09,875 --> 01:12:11,041
A million?

1037
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:26,208
Or…

1038
01:12:29,541 --> 01:12:31,750
Should I just ask Grandma to help out?

1039
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:47,291
Uncle Soei.

1040
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:52,000
What is it?

1041
01:12:53,416 --> 01:12:54,416
It's pure silver.

1042
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:56,791
- You should get a good price for it.
- Gosh.

1043
01:12:56,875 --> 01:12:57,916
Awesome. Come here.

1044
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,416
You're a lifesaver.

1045
01:13:02,333 --> 01:13:04,708
Disappear for a longer while this time.

1046
01:13:09,291 --> 01:13:10,541
I'm sorry for all this, M.

1047
01:13:13,875 --> 01:13:15,458
Take care of Grandma on my behalf.

1048
01:13:20,583 --> 01:13:22,791
Uncle Soei
isn't at his apartment, Grandma.

1049
01:13:22,875 --> 01:13:24,458
I didn't see his motorbike either.

1050
01:13:25,125 --> 01:13:28,041
His neighbors said
he went out of town for work.

1051
01:13:31,333 --> 01:13:32,708
Is anyone home?

1052
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,208
Who's there?

1053
01:13:48,208 --> 01:13:49,833
Is the owner home?

1054
01:13:50,916 --> 01:13:52,833
Must be Soei's creditors.

1055
01:13:52,916 --> 01:13:54,833
Go hide.

1056
01:13:54,916 --> 01:13:56,291
I'll go talk with him.

1057
01:13:58,541 --> 01:13:59,916
Ma'am, hello.

1058
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
You won't find Soei here.

1059
01:14:02,083 --> 01:14:04,000
He's ordained as a monk and won't be back.

1060
01:14:04,083 --> 01:14:07,333
I'm just the housekeeper here.

1061
01:14:07,416 --> 01:14:10,750
I'm not looking for anyone
called Soei, ma'am.

1062
01:14:10,833 --> 01:14:13,666
I saw a post listing this house for sale.

1063
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:16,916
When I texted him, no one replied.

1064
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,208
I'm not sure what to do.

1065
01:14:19,291 --> 01:14:20,875
Thank you, ma'am.

1066
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:23,833
This house isn't for sale.

1067
01:14:24,583 --> 01:14:25,791
Here, ma'am.

1068
01:14:26,666 --> 01:14:29,333
The name is M. Thanapat.

1069
01:14:29,416 --> 01:14:31,250
Is he a broker for someone?

1070
01:14:33,708 --> 01:14:35,916
No. I don't know him.

1071
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:48,083
Grandma.

1072
01:14:49,708 --> 01:14:50,750
Did he leave yet?

1073
01:14:53,291 --> 01:14:54,958
What did you tell the creditor?

1074
01:14:56,333 --> 01:14:57,750
That I'm just the housekeeper.

1075
01:15:00,375 --> 01:15:01,541
You can pull it off.

1076
01:15:01,625 --> 01:15:02,833
Your outfit and all.

1077
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:05,125
Your face too.

1078
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:12,125
Housekeeper, get to work.
Stop sitting around.

1079
01:15:29,208 --> 01:15:30,875
I bought a shirt for you.

1080
01:15:34,416 --> 01:15:35,500
What for?

1081
01:15:35,583 --> 01:15:37,208
For you to wear to work.

1082
01:15:38,625 --> 01:15:39,625
Gosh.

1083
01:15:40,583 --> 01:15:42,208
The shirt is a bit dated.

1084
01:15:44,125 --> 01:15:48,250
After my third treatment,

1085
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:49,666
I'll be cured.

1086
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
You won't have to take care of me anymore.

1087
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:03,125
Are you kicking me out?

1088
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:07,583
When you were in the first grade,

1089
01:16:07,666 --> 01:16:09,500
you used to be at the top of your class.

1090
01:16:10,291 --> 01:16:13,083
You can do whatever you want
if you do it yourself.

1091
01:16:14,083 --> 01:16:15,291
Okay?

1092
01:16:15,375 --> 01:16:17,375
Go find proper work.

1093
01:16:25,458 --> 01:16:27,375
I'm a good-for-nothing, Grandma.

1094
01:16:28,541 --> 01:16:30,250
I can't compete with the others.

1095
01:17:12,708 --> 01:17:16,291
{\an8}<i>This pomegranate tree</i>
<i>was planted when you were born.</i>

1096
01:17:16,375 --> 01:17:18,291
It's just as old as you.

1097
01:17:20,666 --> 01:17:24,500
They say if you grow a pomegranate tree,
the child will be healthy.

1098
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:29,083
You once ordered me
not to give them to anyone

1099
01:17:29,166 --> 01:17:30,916
if the tree was ever to bear fruit.

1100
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,458
I was to keep them only for you.
Here, eat it.

1101
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,708
I don't remember.

1102
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:47,333
I apologize for always saying
you're a <i>qi chou</i>.

1103
01:18:06,583 --> 01:18:08,875
Just let me leech off of you
for the time being.

1104
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:12,458
I'll leave when you're all better.

1105
01:18:19,875 --> 01:18:20,916
Then

1106
01:18:21,833 --> 01:18:23,583
can you go somewhere with me tomorrow?

1107
01:18:27,916 --> 01:18:29,958
{\an8}Is this really your older brother's house?

1108
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:33,708
{\an8}Why wasn't I born into this family?

1109
01:18:36,291 --> 01:18:37,875
{\an8}His house is like a hotel.

1110
01:18:40,625 --> 01:18:42,291
Goodness.

1111
01:18:42,375 --> 01:18:48,750
<i>- Revive me when I'm in need</i>
<i>- Revive me when I'm in need</i>

1112
01:18:48,833 --> 01:18:55,833
<i>- Guide me when I'm lost</i>
<i>- Guide me when I'm lost</i>

1113
01:18:55,916 --> 01:19:02,375
<i>- Always be my source of energy</i>
<i>- Always be my source of energy</i>

1114
01:19:02,458 --> 01:19:08,583
<i>- Warming my heart</i>

1115
01:19:10,291 --> 01:19:15,875
<i>- Your heart</i>
<i>- Your heart</i>

1116
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:21,916
<i>- Is like my heart</i>
<i>- Is like my heart</i>

1117
01:19:22,666 --> 01:19:27,416
<i>- Sealing our hearts among the stars</i>
<i>- Sealing our hearts among the stars</i>

1118
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:34,500
<i>- Pure and bright</i>
<i>- Pure and bright</i>

1119
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:42,625
<i>The reason why my grandson</i>
<i>and I are here today</i>

1120
01:19:43,208 --> 01:19:44,541
is because I've got cancer.

1121
01:19:47,291 --> 01:19:50,375
I want to buy a burial plot,
hoping to extend my lifespan.

1122
01:19:52,083 --> 01:19:53,916
So I'd like you to help me out.

1123
01:19:54,708 --> 01:19:56,375
Perhaps a million, if possible?

1124
01:20:07,833 --> 01:20:11,958
When Dad and Mom
gave you the house at Talat Noi,

1125
01:20:13,458 --> 01:20:15,541
you got several million when you sold it.

1126
01:20:16,833 --> 01:20:19,666
I've never asked you for a single dime.

1127
01:20:21,375 --> 01:20:23,875
Well, Dad and Mom gave it to me, right?

1128
01:20:24,833 --> 01:20:27,500
Don't you remember?
You were there as well.

1129
01:20:33,458 --> 01:20:36,375
But I was the one who wiped their butts.

1130
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:40,166
Why have I never received anything?

1131
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:42,166
Ever since I was a kid,

1132
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:45,458
whatever Dad and Mom got,

1133
01:20:45,541 --> 01:20:47,166
they'd always give it to only you.

1134
01:20:48,125 --> 01:20:51,291
What about the one
who cared for them like me?

1135
01:20:51,375 --> 01:20:53,333
Why didn't I get anything?

1136
01:20:54,625 --> 01:20:56,333
What they did was right.

1137
01:20:58,250 --> 01:20:59,708
If they gave it to you,

1138
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:03,291
it'd all go to your lousy husband.

1139
01:21:03,375 --> 01:21:05,500
But that lousy husband of mine

1140
01:21:05,583 --> 01:21:08,333
was arranged by Dad and Mom for me.

1141
01:21:10,416 --> 01:21:11,916
If you really want money,

1142
01:21:14,541 --> 01:21:16,333
go ask your own offspring then.

1143
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:20,833
Understand?

1144
01:21:23,083 --> 01:21:25,583
As for me,
I wouldn't even give you a penny.

1145
01:21:36,208 --> 01:21:38,458
M, let's go home.

1146
01:21:51,291 --> 01:21:53,458
Leave and don't ever come back.

1147
01:21:55,833 --> 01:21:58,125
You and I don't share
the same family name anymore.

1148
01:22:09,125 --> 01:22:11,958
<i>- Approaching Tha Phra station.</i>
- Grandma. Let's go.

1149
01:22:12,041 --> 01:22:14,541
<i>Please be careful when…</i>

1150
01:22:25,875 --> 01:22:28,041
Why do you want
a big burial plot so badly?

1151
01:22:29,291 --> 01:22:31,875
I want a good plot of land

1152
01:22:31,958 --> 01:22:33,833
so my offspring will be prosperous.

1153
01:22:33,916 --> 01:22:36,041
People will see it and think

1154
01:22:36,125 --> 01:22:37,583
you guys have filial piety.

1155
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:39,833
What nonsense, Grandma.

1156
01:22:39,916 --> 01:22:41,583
That's damn stupid.

1157
01:22:41,666 --> 01:22:44,708
Your parents are in small, shoddy plots,

1158
01:22:44,791 --> 01:22:46,458
but your brother still got rich.

1159
01:22:47,166 --> 01:22:50,416
When people die, they just die.

1160
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:51,833
The brain stops working.

1161
01:22:51,916 --> 01:22:55,125
Then the body will either
become part of earth or water.

1162
01:22:55,208 --> 01:22:57,000
Who knows where it will be?

1163
01:22:57,083 --> 01:22:59,416
You wouldn't even know
what everyone would be up to.

1164
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:01,250
Rich or poor, you wouldn't know.

1165
01:23:03,208 --> 01:23:05,125
But if I die

1166
01:23:05,208 --> 01:23:07,416
and you scatter the flowers carelessly,

1167
01:23:08,333 --> 01:23:10,666
I'll come back to haunt you.

1168
01:23:14,458 --> 01:23:15,916
Sure.

1169
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,041
Just come.

1170
01:23:17,125 --> 01:23:18,333
I hope you come.

1171
01:23:18,416 --> 01:23:22,125
On Tomb Sweeping Day,
you won't even know who shows up or not.

1172
01:23:22,208 --> 01:23:24,458
Uncle Kiang might hire someone
to do the ritual.

1173
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:26,125
I might go on Google Street View

1174
01:23:26,208 --> 01:23:27,666
and pay respect through the screen.

1175
01:23:31,958 --> 01:23:34,250
But if I have a beautiful burial plot…

1176
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:38,666
who knows, you all might want to meet up.

1177
01:24:10,875 --> 01:24:11,791
Have a seat.

1178
01:24:13,375 --> 01:24:14,375
Hello.

1179
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:24,750
<i>After going over the results</i>
<i>of the treatment,</i>

1180
01:24:25,916 --> 01:24:28,083
<i>the patient hasn't shown any improvement.</i>

1181
01:24:32,416 --> 01:24:34,458
The doctor said you're better.

1182
01:24:36,166 --> 01:24:38,166
No need to continue with the chemotherapy.

1183
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:41,458
At first, you said the chemotherapy
will get rid of it.

1184
01:24:42,458 --> 01:24:44,250
Have you taken a good look?

1185
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,166
From now on, we'll treat you
according to your symptoms.

1186
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,166
Don't I need to complete the treatment?

1187
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:56,291
<i>Just like what I said.</i>

1188
01:24:56,375 --> 01:24:59,083
You should give the patient
a lot of your time.

1189
01:24:59,166 --> 01:25:01,208
- This is the most important thing.
- Calm down.

1190
01:25:01,291 --> 01:25:03,166
- It'll be okay.
- The family must stay strong.

1191
01:25:03,250 --> 01:25:04,458
You know,

1192
01:25:05,416 --> 01:25:08,375
Ngek has gone already,
about a few days ago.

1193
01:25:08,458 --> 01:25:10,458
She also didn't complete her chemotherapy.

1194
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:15,250
It's my body.

1195
01:25:16,041 --> 01:25:17,666
I have the right to know, don't I?

1196
01:25:31,791 --> 01:25:32,958
What did Grandma say?

1197
01:25:39,625 --> 01:25:40,833
What does it mean, Mom?

1198
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:49,875
"Rice grains have turned
into cooked rice."

1199
01:25:51,625 --> 01:25:54,000
What's done can't be undone.

1200
01:26:23,458 --> 01:26:26,041
Dad. Mom.

1201
01:26:27,916 --> 01:26:31,416
{\an8}Come and take me with you.
I'm in so much pain.

1202
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:37,541
Grandpa, Grandma. Where are you?

1203
01:26:44,458 --> 01:26:47,083
I want to die.

1204
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,625
I want to die.

1205
01:27:12,125 --> 01:27:13,333
Sew.

1206
01:27:13,416 --> 01:27:14,625
How is Mom feeling?

1207
01:27:15,625 --> 01:27:17,041
The doctor will run some more tests.

1208
01:27:17,125 --> 01:27:19,125
If there's nothing,
she can go home tomorrow.

1209
01:27:22,291 --> 01:27:23,416
Get up.

1210
01:27:29,625 --> 01:27:31,250
Sew, come outside and talk with me.

1211
01:27:42,083 --> 01:27:43,541
Where's the deed to Mom's place?

1212
01:27:46,750 --> 01:27:48,583
Mom isn't even dead yet.

1213
01:27:49,875 --> 01:27:52,041
Why the hell are you asking
about it right now?

1214
01:27:53,208 --> 01:27:56,041
Someone has to take care of it
in the end, right?

1215
01:27:56,125 --> 01:27:58,708
It will be much easier doing it now
than doing it later.

1216
01:28:04,958 --> 01:28:06,916
Your wife put you up to this, didn't she?

1217
01:28:10,625 --> 01:28:11,500
See?

1218
01:28:11,583 --> 01:28:13,916
That's why I don't want
to be a part of this family.

1219
01:28:14,916 --> 01:28:17,875
Why do you guys treat Pinn
as if she's not a member of our family?

1220
01:28:20,958 --> 01:28:22,250
So where's the deed?

1221
01:28:24,166 --> 01:28:26,875
It's in the closet at Mom's place.

1222
01:28:37,083 --> 01:28:38,000
Mom.

1223
01:28:38,083 --> 01:28:41,291
If Uncle Kiang asks Grandma
to sign anything, don't let her sign it.

1224
01:28:41,375 --> 01:28:42,208
Mom.

1225
01:28:43,625 --> 01:28:45,041
Are you listening to me?

1226
01:28:46,291 --> 01:28:47,291
Mom.

1227
01:28:47,375 --> 01:28:48,291
PATIENT ROOM

1228
01:28:51,875 --> 01:28:53,541
Quickly transfer ownership.

1229
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,208
Thank you so much, Sew.

1230
01:29:04,583 --> 01:29:06,375
Grandma gave Uncle Soei the house.

1231
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:23,500
SPECIAL ROOM

1232
01:30:01,833 --> 01:30:02,916
Hold on.

1233
01:30:03,666 --> 01:30:06,000
I'll go settle the bill.

1234
01:30:06,083 --> 01:30:08,250
Take her over to the taxi queue
and wait there.

1235
01:30:10,833 --> 01:30:11,708
M.

1236
01:30:24,833 --> 01:30:29,583
PATIENT PICK-UP AND DROP-OFF

1237
01:30:29,666 --> 01:30:31,375
Haven't you learned your lesson,

1238
01:30:31,458 --> 01:30:33,166
giving money to Uncle Soei?

1239
01:30:34,916 --> 01:30:36,833
Well, he can't look out for himself.

1240
01:30:38,166 --> 01:30:39,791
You're always like this.

1241
01:30:39,875 --> 01:30:41,416
That's why he's a loser.

1242
01:30:47,958 --> 01:30:49,958
I thought you said
the caregiver would be rewarded.

1243
01:30:54,333 --> 01:30:56,083
I don't have anything else to give.

1244
01:30:57,250 --> 01:30:59,125
You don't have to look after me anymore.

1245
01:31:01,375 --> 01:31:03,125
Didn't I take good care of you?

1246
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:12,291
You took good care of me.

1247
01:31:15,375 --> 01:31:16,958
Very good, actually.

1248
01:31:20,583 --> 01:31:22,500
Why won't you ever let me
come first place?

1249
01:31:26,125 --> 01:31:27,666
Where's my spot?

1250
01:31:30,666 --> 01:31:32,291
Where the hell do you put me?

1251
01:31:40,166 --> 01:31:41,208
Give me an answer!

1252
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,333
Answer me, Grandma!

1253
01:31:50,833 --> 01:31:52,250
You're a fool…

1254
01:31:58,208 --> 01:31:59,583
for loving the wrong person.

1255
01:33:04,625 --> 01:33:06,083
Die!

1256
01:33:06,166 --> 01:33:07,458
Your mom is dead!

1257
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:10,541
Done.

1258
01:33:11,791 --> 01:33:13,500
Have you even slept yet?

1259
01:33:13,583 --> 01:33:16,541
Mom! The microphone
is picking up your voice.

1260
01:33:16,625 --> 01:33:17,458
Hey.

1261
01:33:17,541 --> 01:33:20,333
Do you even have viewers
this early in the morning?

1262
01:33:20,416 --> 01:33:22,166
Haven't you ever heard?

1263
01:33:22,250 --> 01:33:25,916
The early bird gets the worm.

1264
01:33:27,125 --> 01:33:28,583
But it has to be a foreign worm.

1265
01:33:40,625 --> 01:33:44,166
The person who bought Grandma's house
is going to come in to renovate it.

1266
01:33:44,250 --> 01:33:46,583
Go there and help pack things away.

1267
01:33:46,666 --> 01:33:48,500
Everything there can be thrown away.

1268
01:33:57,958 --> 01:33:59,583
What is it?

1269
01:33:59,666 --> 01:34:03,458
You sound exactly like Kiang.

1270
01:34:04,208 --> 01:34:05,625
He even said

1271
01:34:05,708 --> 01:34:08,375
he's not going to show up
at her funeral if Grandma dies.

1272
01:34:12,333 --> 01:34:15,916
{\an8}Actually, it's good
that you and I didn't get the house.

1273
01:34:17,833 --> 01:34:21,583
Being the giver feels much better
than being the receiver.

1274
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:25,458
Are you trying
to cheer yourself up or what?

1275
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:28,583
Didn't you want the house as well?

1276
01:34:30,291 --> 01:34:32,875
When did I want it?

1277
01:34:33,958 --> 01:34:37,125
If not, why'd you change your shifts
to visit Grandma so often?

1278
01:34:38,166 --> 01:34:40,125
Because I miss her.

1279
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:49,750
When you weren't home,

1280
01:34:49,833 --> 01:34:51,458
the house was really quiet.

1281
01:34:53,583 --> 01:34:54,583
Were you lonely?

1282
01:34:56,583 --> 01:34:58,583
I finally understood

1283
01:34:58,666 --> 01:35:01,250
how Grandma probably felt

1284
01:35:01,333 --> 01:35:03,125
when everyone moved out.

1285
01:35:33,041 --> 01:35:35,125
Hi. You can park inside.

1286
01:35:35,208 --> 01:35:36,791
I've prepared a room for you, Mui.

1287
01:35:37,541 --> 01:35:39,125
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

1288
01:35:40,208 --> 01:35:42,250
<i>Last time, my aunt blacked out.</i>

1289
01:35:42,333 --> 01:35:44,583
It turns out that she has a heart disease.

1290
01:35:44,666 --> 01:35:46,333
So she wants me to take care of her.

1291
01:35:52,416 --> 01:35:55,416
Her only son passed away
several years ago.

1292
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:58,208
Her daughter-in-law and grandkids
moved abroad permanently.

1293
01:36:09,541 --> 01:36:11,041
Come help out, M.

1294
01:36:12,833 --> 01:36:14,375
I'll take care of her at home.

1295
01:36:15,625 --> 01:36:17,375
You can help take her to the hospital.

1296
01:36:18,666 --> 01:36:20,208
When it comes to an end,

1297
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,333
I'll give you a part of my share.

1298
01:36:48,833 --> 01:36:50,625
I thought you'd have gotten it.

1299
01:36:55,833 --> 01:36:57,375
Grandma told me

1300
01:36:58,291 --> 01:36:59,583
you took good care of her.

1301
01:37:16,291 --> 01:37:17,916
Have you ever dreamt of Grandpa?

1302
01:37:33,166 --> 01:37:34,833
The day Grandpa passed away…

1303
01:37:38,333 --> 01:37:40,500
he choked on his food and then went still.

1304
01:37:45,166 --> 01:37:46,916
I knew how to help him.

1305
01:37:50,458 --> 01:37:51,916
But I didn't.

1306
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:59,166
He kept telling me…

1307
01:38:02,291 --> 01:38:04,125
it's time to let him go.

1308
01:38:11,875 --> 01:38:13,958
I guess he has gone to a good place.

1309
01:38:17,291 --> 01:38:19,083
That's why he's never come to visit me.

1310
01:39:04,583 --> 01:39:06,458
I pay respect
to the benevolent goddess Guanyin.

1311
01:39:06,541 --> 01:39:10,916
The respected Guanyin, savior from peril
and beacon of divine inspiration.

1312
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,041
I pay respect
to the benevolent goddess Guanyin…

1313
01:40:11,416 --> 01:40:16,083
NURSING HOME

1314
01:40:18,125 --> 01:40:19,625
<i>Mom, did you know?</i>

1315
01:40:19,708 --> 01:40:21,708
<i>Uncle Soei didn't take Grandma</i>
<i>to live with him.</i>

1316
01:40:22,375 --> 01:40:24,083
<i>He put her in a nursing home.</i>

1317
01:40:25,250 --> 01:40:26,375
<i>I'm going to visit her.</i>

1318
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:29,375
Hello, Grandma.

1319
01:40:29,458 --> 01:40:30,583
Hello.

1320
01:40:31,416 --> 01:40:33,750
Good morning.

1321
01:40:35,208 --> 01:40:38,541
- Visiting family? Welcome.
- Hello. Visiting family?

1322
01:40:38,625 --> 01:40:39,791
Hello.

1323
01:40:40,583 --> 01:40:41,791
- Hi.
- Visiting family?

1324
01:40:41,875 --> 01:40:43,041
Yes.

1325
01:40:44,666 --> 01:40:46,875
Mr. Chaiyapon, your nephew is here.

1326
01:40:46,958 --> 01:40:48,416
- Yes.
- You can go in.

1327
01:40:59,166 --> 01:41:00,708
Grandma just fell asleep.

1328
01:41:08,750 --> 01:41:10,125
I've paid off all my debts.

1329
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:15,208
There's some money left over.

1330
01:41:17,416 --> 01:41:18,541
You should take it.

1331
01:41:20,041 --> 01:41:21,375
Keep it.

1332
01:41:21,458 --> 01:41:22,666
Hey, it's okay.

1333
01:41:23,250 --> 01:41:25,666
Because from now on,
no one is going to help you out.

1334
01:41:58,208 --> 01:41:59,333
Who is it?

1335
01:42:00,958 --> 01:42:02,458
It's your <i>qi chou</i>, Grandma.

1336
01:42:03,625 --> 01:42:05,208
Have you eaten yet?

1337
01:42:24,958 --> 01:42:28,000
Perfect, I wanted to show off my sexiness.

1338
01:42:45,041 --> 01:42:46,625
Grandma, come home with me.

1339
01:42:48,166 --> 01:42:50,083
I'll make you congee.

1340
01:42:56,666 --> 01:42:57,833
Let's go home.

1341
01:44:15,250 --> 01:44:16,750
Mom!

1342
01:44:18,541 --> 01:44:20,458
Why are you keeping this?

1343
01:44:20,541 --> 01:44:23,625
What? You do it too.

1344
01:44:23,708 --> 01:44:24,875
What are you doing here?

1345
01:44:24,958 --> 01:44:26,500
Go back and lie down.

1346
01:44:29,166 --> 01:44:33,541
You shouldn't eat expired stuff like me.

1347
01:44:33,625 --> 01:44:35,750
Cancer is genetic.

1348
01:44:36,750 --> 01:44:38,750
I know.

1349
01:44:38,833 --> 01:44:40,333
Sons inherit the assets.

1350
01:44:40,416 --> 01:44:41,750
Daughters inherit cancer.

1351
01:44:43,458 --> 01:44:45,958
What are you talking about?

1352
01:44:46,041 --> 01:44:48,291
Memory in the making, right?

1353
01:44:48,375 --> 01:44:49,833
Go on as you were.

1354
01:44:54,916 --> 01:44:56,083
M…

1355
01:44:58,041 --> 01:45:00,291
is always badgering me,

1356
01:45:02,166 --> 01:45:03,750
asking me

1357
01:45:03,833 --> 01:45:05,625
who I love the most.

1358
01:45:07,333 --> 01:45:08,708
{\an8}I don't know either.

1359
01:45:11,333 --> 01:45:12,708
But all I know is

1360
01:45:13,875 --> 01:45:16,000
that I want to stay with you the most.

1361
01:45:49,833 --> 01:45:51,208
- Hello, Auntie Pinn.
- Hello.

1362
01:45:56,875 --> 01:45:59,208
Happy Chinese New Year.

1363
01:46:00,625 --> 01:46:04,041
You can just say it in Teochew, Rainbow.

1364
01:46:04,125 --> 01:46:05,458
Let's go see Grandma.

1365
01:46:23,833 --> 01:46:25,583
I'm not sure if you know, Uncle Kiang.

1366
01:46:26,666 --> 01:46:28,583
Grandma once told me that

1367
01:46:28,666 --> 01:46:30,958
beef was her favorite food.

1368
01:46:31,958 --> 01:46:33,916
But when you were a kid,
you were often sick.

1369
01:46:34,708 --> 01:46:37,125
So she asked the goddess Guanyin
to look after you

1370
01:46:38,166 --> 01:46:40,958
and for you to be strong and healthy.

1371
01:46:42,541 --> 01:46:44,375
In return, she'd stop eating beef forever.

1372
01:47:05,333 --> 01:47:06,916
Kiang.

1373
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:08,166
Come on out.

1374
01:47:09,416 --> 01:47:11,166
You haven't been able to sleep lately.

1375
01:47:39,166 --> 01:47:40,166
Grandma.

1376
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,708
Your son came to visit you.

1377
01:47:42,791 --> 01:47:43,833
Smile.

1378
01:47:57,166 --> 01:47:58,166
Grandma.

1379
01:47:59,541 --> 01:48:01,666
Uncle Kiang is holding your hand.

1380
01:48:11,416 --> 01:48:13,958
Mom, you're very lucky

1381
01:48:14,041 --> 01:48:15,958
to have a grandson
taking good care of you.

1382
01:51:26,958 --> 01:51:33,041
DAOCHAI FAMILY

1383
01:51:38,125 --> 01:51:41,500
Tendons, tripe, and flat iron steak,
braised until they're tender, Grandma.

1384
01:51:44,541 --> 01:51:47,166
Did you see the silver belt
that Grandpa gave?

1385
01:51:47,250 --> 01:51:49,375
I don't know where I put it.
I can't find it.

1386
01:52:10,166 --> 01:52:11,583
Is this some kind of scam?

1387
01:52:12,375 --> 01:52:14,625
My Grandma has passed away. I'm sorry.

1388
01:52:32,333 --> 01:52:33,583
{\an8}SIAM SAVINGS BANK

1389
01:52:33,666 --> 01:52:38,541
{\an8}MRS. MENGJU SAEJIEW
FOR MR. THANAPAT THAWARAKUL

1390
01:52:38,625 --> 01:52:40,041
<i>When was this account opened?</i>

1391
01:52:43,666 --> 01:52:44,958
Why don't I remember it?

1392
01:53:15,916 --> 01:53:17,541
All you do is play games.

1393
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:21,291
You walk so slowly.

1394
01:53:21,375 --> 01:53:23,458
The bank is going to close.

1395
01:53:23,541 --> 01:53:26,041
Grandma, you walk slowly too.

1396
01:53:27,750 --> 01:53:29,666
I'm going to open an account.

1397
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:30,708
See?

1398
01:53:30,791 --> 01:53:32,458
I'm going to make a deposit for you.

1399
01:53:33,541 --> 01:53:35,666
You were able to become the top
of your class.

1400
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:38,458
I'm going to keep putting in a deposit
throughout the year.

1401
01:53:41,541 --> 01:53:43,708
Can you keep putting in a deposit
until you die?

1402
01:53:45,583 --> 01:53:47,500
I want to have millions.

1403
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:50,916
Gosh. Are you cursing me?

1404
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:54,083
What are you going to do with a million?

1405
01:53:54,166 --> 01:53:56,750
I'm going to buy you a new house, Grandma.

1406
01:53:57,541 --> 01:53:58,958
Your house is old.

1407
01:53:59,750 --> 01:54:02,583
It's crawling over with roaches.

1408
01:54:02,666 --> 01:54:05,000
Just talking about it
gives me goosebumps. See?

1409
01:54:05,083 --> 01:54:07,000
My goodness, you got the goosebumps?

1410
01:54:07,083 --> 01:54:09,958
You're just so full of it.

1411
01:54:28,958 --> 01:54:31,166
I'd like to withdraw everything
and close the account.

1412
01:54:51,291 --> 01:54:52,500
M.

1413
01:54:52,583 --> 01:54:54,791
Knock on the coffin
and tell Grandma the directions.

1414
01:55:00,708 --> 01:55:01,750
Grandma.

1415
01:55:03,625 --> 01:55:05,125
We're about to leave.

1416
01:55:34,083 --> 01:55:35,250
Grandma.

1417
01:55:36,208 --> 01:55:37,708
We're passing the congee shop.

1418
01:55:48,750 --> 01:55:49,666
Grandma.

1419
01:55:49,750 --> 01:55:51,458
We're crossing the bridge.

1420
01:56:24,958 --> 01:56:26,000
Grandma.

1421
01:56:27,041 --> 01:56:29,000
We've arrived at the house
I bought for you.

1422
01:56:52,875 --> 01:56:53,875
Grandma.

1423
01:56:55,875 --> 01:56:57,583
You're my first place.

1424
01:57:40,416 --> 01:57:41,875
Rainbow.

1425
01:57:41,958 --> 01:57:43,208
What are you doing?

1426
01:57:43,291 --> 01:57:44,208
Here.

1427
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,791
Go scatter the flowers for Grandma.

1428
01:57:47,875 --> 01:57:50,041
Soei, why don't you help lay out the food?

1429
01:57:50,125 --> 01:57:52,625
- I'm trying to win a 12-million lotto.
- Gosh.

1430
01:57:54,083 --> 01:57:56,833
There you go.
Spread them out nicely for Grandma.

1431
01:57:56,916 --> 01:57:59,333
Kiang, how old was Mom? She was 78, right?

1432
01:57:59,416 --> 01:58:00,875
- Rainbow.
- It's 79 in Chinese count.

1433
01:58:00,958 --> 01:58:02,500
Let me help.

1434
01:58:03,500 --> 01:58:04,541
Here, do it like this.

1435
01:58:04,625 --> 01:58:05,666
I'll show you.

1436
01:58:05,750 --> 01:58:07,500
- Watch.
- Nine hundred ninety-seven…

1437
01:58:08,208 --> 01:58:10,166
It doesn't matter what number.

1438
01:58:10,250 --> 01:58:12,041
You'll never win.

1439
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:15,250
Do you have one ending with 22?

1440
01:58:15,333 --> 01:58:17,750
Why would you want that number?
It's going to be 79!

1441
01:58:19,583 --> 01:58:20,958
Take a picture!

1442
01:58:30,375 --> 01:58:33,083
{\an8}Okay, do you want to stay here? Fine.

1443
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:14,000
