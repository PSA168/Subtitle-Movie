00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,942
Joe, you hear that?

11
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:18,687
No. Hear what?

12
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,559
I thought Big Red
wasn't scared of anything.

13
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,171
You getting the heebie-jeebies, friend?

14
00:01:25,389 --> 00:01:26,912
I am the heebie-jeebies.

15
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:35,507
Remind me why Junior G-man's
coming along for a ride?

16
00:01:35,508 --> 00:01:38,402
I'm just here to make sure that
whatever's in that box

17
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:40,187
and one pretty lady

18
00:01:40,448 --> 00:01:43,712
make another 600 miles to
Fairfield without any trouble.

19
00:01:55,332 --> 00:01:57,073
So what's in the box?

20
00:01:57,378 --> 00:01:58,814
Should I tell him?

21
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:04,472
A funnel-web spider.

22
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:07,736
Probably the most
deadly arachnid in the world.

23
00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:11,305
Only this one seems
to house a plausibly

24
00:02:11,306 --> 00:02:13,175
demonic entity.

25
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:15,004
You're yanking my chain, right?

26
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:16,397
That's not the half of it.

27
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:20,531
There's all manner of bizarre
phenomena associated with this creature.

28
00:02:20,532 --> 00:02:21,749
Temporal, gravitational

29
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,686
I mean things
you wouldn't believe.

30
00:02:23,687 --> 00:02:25,351
I barely believe it
and I've cataloged

31
00:02:25,352 --> 00:02:27,016
the photographic evidence
in detail.

32
00:02:27,017 --> 00:02:28,408
It's been kept sedated

33
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:30,105
in a state of sensory
deprivation

34
00:02:30,106 --> 00:02:32,804
until we can analyze it
in a more controlled setting.

35
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:35,546
Dammit, you're not hearing that?

36
00:02:35,547 --> 00:02:36,895
Hellboy, are you okay?

37
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:40,247
What's happening?

38
00:02:41,706 --> 00:02:43,162
Oh my god!

39
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,778
Oh my god!

40
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:52,432

00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,187
- You alright?
- Yeah, yeah.

47
00:03:51,188 --> 00:03:53,058
Hey, lay dead a sec.

48
00:04:00,892 --> 00:04:02,590
Ah! Oh fuck!

49
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:07,029
Oh shit.

50
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,142
Hellboy, Hellboy, look.

51
00:04:42,194 --> 00:04:43,717
I like them better small.

52
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:46,329
Don't let him get away.
Don't let him get away.

53
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:56,252
It's...

54
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,743
Oh crap.

55
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:13,748
Who builds a tunnel to hell
in the middle of the woods?

56
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:16,011
Some kind of ventilation shaft.

57
00:05:19,057 --> 00:05:20,537
Coal mining country.

58
00:05:20,538 --> 00:05:22,104
Appalachia.

59
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,804
Well that's just swell,
we lost the cargo.

60
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:29,459
After you.

61
00:05:32,462 --> 00:05:34,377
Come on...

62
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:38,860
He, he, he.

63
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:55,137
Joe?

64
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:56,399
I'm okay.

65
00:05:59,489 --> 00:06:00,795
Field work, huh?

66
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,058
It's not much like
research, is it?

67
00:06:07,062 --> 00:06:08,368
I just don't get it.

68
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:10,979
Spider what made it
go crazy like that?

69
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:17,246
Something in these hills.

70
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,074
Trees,

71
00:06:19,596 --> 00:06:21,381
and the dirt.

72
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,775
Something haunted.

73
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:26,473
Evil.

74
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:29,345
This place has the stink.

75
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:34,655
I smell pine needles?

76
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,744
Underneath that, Joe.

77
00:06:37,788 --> 00:06:39,007
Madness.

78
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:41,313
Death,

79
00:06:41,575 --> 00:06:43,446
called out to Daddy Longlegs.

80
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:45,274
Woke him up.

81
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:47,581
How do you know that?

82
00:06:49,887 --> 00:06:52,455
Dark things call to dark things.

83
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:55,719
I heard it too.

84
00:06:58,156 --> 00:06:59,548
We are so screwed.

85
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:02,246
Screwed, chewed, and tattooed.

86
00:07:02,247 --> 00:07:05,163
We need, we need to find a
phone. We need to call this in.

87
00:07:06,295 --> 00:07:07,427
Yeah.

88
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,447
Ma?

89
00:07:28,273 --> 00:07:31,755
Around these parts I'm not sure
which one of us stands out more.

90
00:07:31,756 --> 00:07:33,888
It's the devil come up the road.

91
00:07:36,064 --> 00:07:37,195
No it ain't.

92
00:07:37,196 --> 00:07:38,195
Get!

93
00:07:39,023 --> 00:07:41,634
It's that red fella
from the United Nations.

94
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:44,289
I've seen him once on
the cover of Life magazine.

95
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:46,466
United Nations?

96
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:48,076
Look at you...

97
00:07:49,947 --> 00:07:51,645
little oriental doll.

98
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:54,517
Ain't you a purdy thing.

99
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:56,650
Um

100
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:58,520
I'm Special Agent Song, ma'am.

101
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:01,481
We've been in an accident;
do you happen to have a phone?

102
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:02,482
Sure we do.

103
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:06,747
It's in back next to the color
television

104
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:10,881
and the chicken that
shits out silver dollars...

105
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,408
- and the Mercedes Benz.
- Alright.

106
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:18,323
May as well come inside.

107
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,850
Ma'am, get these on some modern rags,
doll, they're all cut up and bloody.

108
00:08:22,851 --> 00:08:24,808
Oh no, that's not necessary.

109
00:08:29,073 --> 00:08:30,858
What happened to him?

110
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,556
He ain't moved a muscle
since I found him.

111
00:08:36,211 --> 00:08:38,953
Anyone thought of
taking him to the doctor?

112
00:08:38,954 --> 00:08:41,042
You guys have doctors, right?

113
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:44,175
- Or you like him as a rug?
- Truck's out.

114
00:08:44,176 --> 00:08:46,852
Anyhow ain't no doctor
gonna do him no good.

115
00:08:46,853 --> 00:08:49,529
- Why's that?
- Cause he witched, that's why.

116
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,572
Witched?

117
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:52,596
Child didn't have no sense.

118
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:54,620
Kept teasing that Cora Fisher.

119
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:57,971
Throwing rocks at her window,
leaving dead things for her to find.

120
00:08:57,972 --> 00:09:01,758
Told him he better stay away from her.
Everyone knows Cora Fisher be a witch.

121
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,107
You said Cora Fisher?

122
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:06,023
Tom Ferrell. I will be damned.

123
00:09:06,024 --> 00:09:07,590
I ain't dead yet.

124
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:11,551
Never thought we'd see
you around these parts again.

125
00:09:11,855 --> 00:09:13,640
How many years it been, Tom?

126
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:16,643
A spell, I reckon.

127
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:18,949
I found this in the doorstep.

128
00:09:20,168 --> 00:09:21,169
Hmm.

129
00:09:21,517 --> 00:09:23,563
Let's see it.

130
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:25,956
Ahh.

131
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:28,002
Yeah.

132
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:30,700
Witch ball.

133
00:09:31,266 --> 00:09:33,355
Yeah, I've I heard of these.

134
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:39,753
That's what made
that mark there, ma'am.

135
00:09:39,754 --> 00:09:41,711
You said Cora Fisher did this?

136
00:09:42,364 --> 00:09:43,278
Why, you know her?

137
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,584
Used to.

138
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,325
She wasn't a witch back then.

139
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:54,985
Take off that boy's clothes and
boil them, calling it out Cora Fisher's name.

140
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,075
If she's one that witched him,
that'll bust the spell.

141
00:10:00,774 --> 00:10:02,427
You going up there, ain't ya?

142
00:10:02,732 --> 00:10:04,081
Yeah, reckon I will.

143
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,910
First I'm going to
stop by and see my mama.

144
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,697
Sorry, Tom.

145
00:10:11,698 --> 00:10:13,003
Figured you knew.

146
00:10:14,091 --> 00:10:15,136
She's, uh...

147
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:18,052
she's dead?

148
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:20,445
Long time now.

149
00:10:20,837 --> 00:10:24,449
Her brother come up to fetch
her. Took her back East.

150
00:10:26,321 --> 00:10:27,627
Oh, ain't that, uh...

151
00:10:28,802 --> 00:10:30,325
what about my daddy, then?

152
00:10:30,804 --> 00:10:32,892
Never did see much of him.

153
00:10:32,893 --> 00:10:34,981
Not once since you left.

154
00:10:34,982 --> 00:10:37,593
Guess he finally drunk himself
to death.

155
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:40,335
He weren't ever much good.

156
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:43,077
Well, friends,

157
00:10:43,338 --> 00:10:45,645
ma'am, I'll be on my way.

158
00:10:46,297 --> 00:10:48,778
Just a second, Mr. Ferrell.

159
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:50,170
Um, was it?

160
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:51,563
It's Tom.

161
00:10:51,564 --> 00:10:52,564
Tom,

162
00:10:52,913 --> 00:10:54,218
this witch, Cora

163
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,915
you might say, eh

164
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,179
this sort of thing falls
under our

165
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,920
sphere of expertise.

166
00:11:01,312 --> 00:11:04,489
- Do you mind if we come along?
- Excuse us. Tom.

167
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,970
Hey. What are you doing?

168
00:11:06,971 --> 00:11:09,451
- Field work.
- Field work?

169
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:11,540
You're lucky to be alive.

170
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:14,237
I'm taking you back
to headquarters,

171
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:15,978
where you belong,
in the library,

172
00:11:15,979 --> 00:11:18,329
spilling coffee
on your weird old books.

173
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,853
There's something going on here.

174
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:21,550
You said it yourself.

175
00:11:22,856 --> 00:11:24,858
'This place has the stink.'

176
00:11:24,859 --> 00:11:26,119
Yeah, it does.

177
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,382
It's exactly why you shouldn't
be here.

178
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,646
Look, I... I need to
understand it.

179
00:11:30,994 --> 00:11:34,171
Okay? And not from some weird
old book, but for real.

180
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:37,044
Like you do.

181
00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:42,092
Besides, are you really in such a hurry
to tell Broom we lost the cargo?

182
00:11:42,093 --> 00:11:44,704
If y'all are coming along
you best come along.

183
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:50,927
<i>♪ May not believe
it but it has to be told ♪</i>

184
00:11:51,885 --> 00:11:57,455
<i>♪ A poor soul
doing the Dead Man's Stroll ♪</i>

185
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:04,832
Ohh.

186
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:19,455
Who's that there?

187
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:24,439
Oh,

188
00:12:25,005 --> 00:12:27,094
look at you

189
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,660
all pie-eyed.

190
00:12:29,661 --> 00:12:32,099
What you come see
Grammy Oakum for?

191
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:36,058
Huh?

192
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:37,516
What's that?

193
00:12:38,976 --> 00:12:40,107
Oh,

194
00:12:41,325 --> 00:12:44,720
they want to know
how to make a witch ball.

195
00:12:44,721 --> 00:12:46,482
Well, I'll tell you.

196
00:12:46,483 --> 00:12:48,495
It's easy peasy,

197
00:12:48,496 --> 00:12:50,508
you dance around,

198
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:51,987
buck naked

199
00:12:51,988 --> 00:12:54,295
calling out: blood of weasel,

200
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,949
tail a rat,

201
00:12:56,732 --> 00:13:00,735
guts and bladder of a black cat,

202
00:13:00,736 --> 00:13:04,740
buzzard eggs and baby's nails,

203
00:13:04,741 --> 00:13:07,090
foot of toad frog,

204
00:13:07,091 --> 00:13:08,830
brain of bat.

205
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:10,659
And you put a pot to boil

206
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,355
and it all goes in.

207
00:13:12,356 --> 00:13:14,750
Cut some hairs from your head

208
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:16,534
and your nethers,

209
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:18,754
and wrap 'em

210
00:13:19,146 --> 00:13:21,625
round a gob of stuff from
the pot.

211
00:13:21,626 --> 00:13:25,761
Make 'em round
and a good size for throwing

212
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,895
and that's that.

213
00:13:28,896 --> 00:13:30,853
You people

214
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,641
wanna trade your souls
for some balls of poison.

215
00:13:36,642 --> 00:13:40,471
Grammy Oakum says: 'Go
right at it.'

216
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:43,213
And she'll see you

217
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:45,825
in hell.

218
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:55,312
Magazine said they found you in
a church in England.

219
00:13:57,532 --> 00:13:58,838
So they tell me.

220
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,362
That's all right.

221
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:04,539
Everybody knows the devil
can't set foot in no church.

222
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:09,979
You know I'm not actually, uh

223
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,980
The devil?

224
00:14:10,981 --> 00:14:11,981
Yeah.

225
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:13,374
Oh,

226
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:15,527
no, I met that son of a bitch.

227
00:14:15,528 --> 00:14:17,334
He don't look nothing like you.

228
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,772
Here's Cora's place.

229
00:14:23,384 --> 00:14:24,580
Cora!

230
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:25,777
It's Tom!

231
00:14:26,604 --> 00:14:27,779
Tom Ferrell!

232
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:52,239
Cora?

233
00:14:58,941 --> 00:14:59,942
Cora?

234
00:15:06,427 --> 00:15:08,472
You knew this girl pretty
well, huh?

235
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:11,866
Well

236
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:14,914
we, uh, we weren't much more
than kids.

237
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:16,959
We were sweethearts.

238
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:18,918
Figured we'd

239
00:15:19,831 --> 00:15:21,268
always be together.

240
00:15:23,444 --> 00:15:25,054
It's a long time ago, I guess.

241
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:20,892
Oh, girl

242
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:23,024
what you do?

243
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,549
Great. Fucking witch balls.

244
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,078
There's more.

245
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:55,014
Eh, guys?

246
00:17:22,563 --> 00:17:25,783
What do you make of this?

247
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:28,525
She must be out roaming around.

248
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:31,180
Just gotta wait for her to
get back.

249
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:40,363
That'll be her demon familiar,
I suspect.

250
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:43,453
I hate those.

251
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,761
They feed on
the witch they're attached to.

252
00:17:46,762 --> 00:17:48,850
They feed off each other.

253
00:17:49,285 --> 00:17:51,243
The witch, the animal.

254
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:54,769
According to the lore, they
function as symbiotic parasites.

255
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:55,987
The lore.

256
00:17:57,293 --> 00:17:58,947
Lord, have mercy.

257
00:18:02,342 --> 00:18:04,431
My mother was a witch.

258
00:18:05,736 --> 00:18:09,610
I bet they left that little detail out
of your magazine, huh, Tom?

259
00:18:09,611 --> 00:18:10,654
Hmm?

260
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,744
I never met my mother.

261
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:19,272
Never wanted to.

262
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:24,581
In fact...

263
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,977
everything I ever knew
about witches

264
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,980
I wish I didn't.

265
00:18:36,724 --> 00:18:39,683
On the way up here
you mentioned you saw the devil.

266
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,166
Some 15 years ago,

267
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:47,648
about a mile from this
very spot,

268
00:18:49,302 --> 00:18:51,478
come upon a stream, and

269
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:53,132
there she was.

270
00:18:54,655 --> 00:18:55,743
No, not the devil.

271
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:57,571
Close enough.

272
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,182
Her name was Effie Kolb.

273
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:02,315
I knew right off

274
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:04,317
she was trouble.

275
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:07,710
I'm ashamed to say

276
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:10,540
I forgot all about
poor old Cora Fisher after that.

277
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,411
You see, Effie,

278
00:19:12,412 --> 00:19:15,850
she was a witch,
and she got me all twisted up,

279
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:18,635
thinking maybe I ought
to be a witch, too.

280
00:19:19,636 --> 00:19:22,813
And all that talk about
having power over other folks,

281
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:24,902
made it sound real good.

282
00:19:24,903 --> 00:19:26,729
Yeah.

283
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:29,145
So, I went out
and I got me a dead black cat.

284
00:19:29,146 --> 00:19:31,561
While my Ma was out,
I boiled it on the stovetop

285
00:19:31,562 --> 00:19:33,476
till it went all to pieces.

286
00:19:33,998 --> 00:19:35,696
Took that mess down
to the creek,

287
00:19:35,697 --> 00:19:37,437
to clean off the bones.

288
00:19:37,698 --> 00:19:41,571
Now Effie told me whatever bone
I was holding when the devil showed up

289
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,836
that was gonna be my lucky bone.

290
00:19:45,837 --> 00:19:47,447
So arbitrary.

291
00:19:55,498 --> 00:19:57,935
I knew him right off.

292
00:19:59,154 --> 00:20:01,591
I heard tales about him all
my life.

293
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:04,811
Mister Onselm,

294
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:06,509
some of the old folks
called him.

295
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,209
Most just called him the
Crooked Man.

296
00:20:10,687 --> 00:20:13,602
Crooked Man. Uhh.

297
00:20:13,603 --> 00:20:16,954
As story goes, Mr. Onselm
was one of the first white men

298
00:20:16,955 --> 00:20:19,805
who came here from Europe
hundreds of years ago.

299
00:20:19,806 --> 00:20:22,656
He played both sides
in the war between the states.

300
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:25,963
He came to be a very rich man.

301
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:28,879
Sounds like a real clever
little fella.

302
00:20:30,664 --> 00:20:32,492
How did that work out for him?

303
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:37,148
They say heaven don't have much
room for rich folks.

304
00:20:37,627 --> 00:20:39,368
They got plenty down there.

305
00:20:39,934 --> 00:20:41,892
They sent him back up,

306
00:20:42,415 --> 00:20:45,026
to claim souls instead of
legal tender.

307
00:20:45,027 --> 00:20:46,680
They say he takes a

308
00:20:46,681 --> 00:20:48,289
a copper penny

309
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,814
for every soul he claims for
the devil.

310
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,383
He gets enough of them,
one day he'll be rich again.

311
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:59,432
One look at old Mr. Onselm scared all them
witchy thoughts right out of me.

312
00:21:00,433 --> 00:21:03,610
Got lit off for home, swearing
the whole way to be good again.

313
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:07,788
I even took that lucky bone,
threw it as far as I could.

314
00:21:09,355 --> 00:21:11,313
Somehow I never could be
rid of it.

315
00:21:11,661 --> 00:21:15,056
I was so scared when I got home,
I just kept right on running.

316
00:21:15,057 --> 00:21:17,145
Guess that's how I wound up in
the army.

317
00:21:23,064 --> 00:21:24,413
I come through it,

318
00:21:26,546 --> 00:21:28,374
without a scratch.

319
00:21:29,418 --> 00:21:31,594
It ain't because I was
born lucky,

320
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,291
smart,

321
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,423
tough...

322
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:37,557
quite the opposite.

323
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,697
It's got power in it.

324
00:21:48,263 --> 00:21:49,830
Just like that old witch said:

325
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:52,398
It's got the power to hurt
people.

326
00:21:53,573 --> 00:21:55,401
But I never used it.

327
00:21:56,053 --> 00:21:57,619
Not once.

328
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,971
Like I said, I never wished harm
on anybody my entire life.

329
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:05,454
But not even them boys over there trying
their damndest to put holes in me.

330
00:22:06,194 --> 00:22:08,675
You think that means
I ain't really a witch?

331
00:22:10,678 --> 00:22:12,418
You hear something?

332
00:23:28,842 --> 00:23:31,279
Ahh!

333
00:23:34,108 --> 00:23:35,370
No.

334
00:23:35,762 --> 00:23:37,633
Ahh!

335
00:23:37,981 --> 00:23:40,244
Ahh! Ma!

336
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:51,560
Cora.

337
00:24:00,613 --> 00:24:02,310
I'm sorry, Cora.

338
00:24:02,745 --> 00:24:04,312
You can't see me like this, Tom.

339
00:24:04,313 --> 00:24:05,617
Shh, shh.

340
00:24:05,618 --> 00:24:06,727
You just can't.

341
00:24:06,728 --> 00:24:07,836
Hey, it's alright.

342
00:24:07,837 --> 00:24:09,448
Hey, Cora, it's alright.

343
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:11,232
Shh, Shh.

344
00:24:17,717 --> 00:24:20,328
Enjoying that field work, Joe?

345
00:24:20,937 --> 00:24:22,548
How do you get used to this?

346
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,073
I'm gonna get you by the fire.

347
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:30,511
Why you done it, Cora? Huh?

348
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:32,383
I know I was
a shit for brains kid back then,

349
00:24:32,384 --> 00:24:34,080
but you was the smart one.

350
00:24:34,081 --> 00:24:36,170
After you left, I didn't know
what to do.

351
00:24:36,171 --> 00:24:39,086
I had to go up with
Nate Southby.

352
00:24:39,087 --> 00:24:41,131
We married, but he died.

353
00:24:41,828 --> 00:24:43,872
Our babies died.

354
00:24:43,873 --> 00:24:45,439
I was all alone, Tom.

355
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,746
It's alright.
You just gotta rest now, okay?

356
00:24:47,747 --> 00:24:50,052
- You just gotta rest.
- They're coming for me.

357
00:24:50,053 --> 00:24:53,361
They're out there, Tom. They want my soul,
and they gonna have it.

358
00:24:53,362 --> 00:24:55,494
Not while I'm here. Not while
I'm here.

359
00:24:55,885 --> 00:24:57,321
Hey, Shh, shh, shh, shh.

360
00:25:04,981 --> 00:25:06,308
She out there!

361
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:07,472
She out...

362
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:08,637
Shh, shh.

363
00:25:17,254 --> 00:25:19,953
Looks like Deadsville to me.

364
00:25:25,611 --> 00:25:26,960
Ohh.

365
00:25:34,794 --> 00:25:35,882
Hey, you're alright.

366
00:25:41,452 --> 00:25:43,367
Who's this now?

367
00:25:44,064 --> 00:25:46,675
This ain't who I come to see.

368
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:52,899
Well, don't I just like the
look of you.

369
00:25:54,465 --> 00:25:57,991
She never did have much
use for going to church clothes.

370
00:25:57,992 --> 00:25:59,906
There's my Tommy.

371
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:03,083
She don't look a day older
than the last time I saw her.

372
00:26:03,084 --> 00:26:05,606
The only way to tell how old a
witch is,

373
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:08,523
you gotta cut her leg
off and count the rings.

374
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:11,308
You come back to see me, Tommy?

375
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:12,701
Hell no, I ain't.

376
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:15,182
You know who I came to see.

377
00:26:15,748 --> 00:26:18,968
Not that pitiful thing
Cora Fisher I hope.

378
00:26:19,403 --> 00:26:24,017
Why, she ain't even much worth tormenting,
but I do it all the same.

379
00:26:27,673 --> 00:26:31,502
How's a girl expected to pass
the time?

380
00:26:32,025 --> 00:26:38,771
I don't know what you ever saw
in that tragic little creature, Tommy.

381
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,512
Why she barely got any soul
to steal.

382
00:26:42,513 --> 00:26:45,299
You keep her name out of your
mouth, you wicked old whore!

383
00:26:47,736 --> 00:26:50,739
I'm just playing.

384
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:57,528
You 'member how I like to
play, Tom?

385
00:26:57,529 --> 00:26:59,052
Don't you?

386
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:02,206
I know why you're here.

387
00:27:02,207 --> 00:27:04,405
And he knows it, too.

388
00:27:05,101 --> 00:27:06,189
He got,

389
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:08,191
let's just call it

390
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:12,892
un-finished business with you.

391
00:27:12,893 --> 00:27:14,196
I know.

392
00:27:14,197 --> 00:27:15,677
I aim to finish it.

393
00:27:17,005 --> 00:27:18,332
Ahh!

394
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:20,855
- Jesus
- Hey!

395
00:27:20,856 --> 00:27:24,251
Still a wild hare with
more spunk than sense, ain't ya?

396
00:27:24,252 --> 00:27:25,291
Hey that's enough of that.

397
00:27:26,209 --> 00:27:29,169
You tell your master if he wants
to get to these poor folks,

398
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,040
he's gonna have to go
through me.

399
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:33,869
You? Ha. Mister

400
00:27:34,478 --> 00:27:37,786
he ain't a tiny bit afraid
of you.

401
00:27:38,352 --> 00:27:40,027
And Tommy,

402
00:27:40,028 --> 00:27:41,702
I near forgot.

403
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:45,098
He asked me to give you a
present.

404
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:48,057
No!

405
00:27:48,405 --> 00:27:50,668
'fraid he don't look like much.

406
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:54,673
I've been riding him pretty hard
every night since you left.

407
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:58,720
Guess he pretty near wore out.

408
00:27:58,721 --> 00:27:59,852
Curse you, Effie Kolb!

409
00:28:00,287 --> 00:28:01,722
Curse you!

410
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:02,811
This can't be real.

411
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:05,901
Radioactive, man.

412
00:28:08,512 --> 00:28:09,600
Oh,

413
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:15,781
Oh, no.

414
00:28:16,651 --> 00:28:18,218
No.

415
00:28:31,144 --> 00:28:33,233
What'd they do to you,
Daddy? What?

416
00:28:36,453 --> 00:28:39,500
Daddy. Shh, shh, shh. Hey.

417
00:28:39,501 --> 00:28:40,806
Tommy.

418
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:44,373
That's you, boy?

419
00:28:44,374 --> 00:28:47,290
You, you come home.

420
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:48,290
You.

421
00:28:48,465 --> 00:28:49,902
Come...

422
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,255
I'm sorry, Daddy. I...

423
00:29:07,223 --> 00:29:08,485
Cora?

424
00:29:10,226 --> 00:29:14,187
Is Reverend Watts still in that little church
up on the side of the mountain?

425
00:29:14,188 --> 00:29:16,537
He is, but you can't go up
there, Tom.

426
00:29:17,103 --> 00:29:18,931
You heard Effie Kolb,

427
00:29:19,192 --> 00:29:21,585
Crooked Man's waiting on ya.

428
00:29:23,283 --> 00:29:24,675
Maybe he is...

429
00:29:26,634 --> 00:29:28,418
Maybe that's why I came back.

430
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,900
Thought I'd have it out
with that old devil.

431
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:36,862
Not before I get this
sinner buried in church ground.

432
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:42,345
Oh, my God, Cora!

433
00:29:43,346 --> 00:29:44,999
Oh!

434
00:29:55,315 --> 00:29:56,619
Oh.

435
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,666
- You didn't want me to squash?
- No,

436
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:00,145
squashing's good.

437
00:30:00,146 --> 00:30:01,669
Totally approve of that.

438
00:30:07,415 --> 00:30:10,243
<i>♪ Did you ever really
love me? ♪</i>

439

443
00:30:41,274 --> 00:30:43,015
What?

444
00:30:43,363 --> 00:30:45,844
Nothing. Shh...

445
00:30:48,803 --> 00:30:51,632
Hey, try to get some Z's, okay?

446
00:30:52,285 --> 00:30:53,677
Yeah right.

447
00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:12,653

<i>♪ ever really love me?</i>

451
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,164
You want me to take him
for a while?

452
00:31:46,165 --> 00:31:50,256
Oh, it's my sins that done it.
He's my burden to carry.

453
00:31:52,171 --> 00:31:53,912
Think of it a little different,

454
00:31:54,651 --> 00:31:57,610
I think sins are
just a part of who we are.

455
00:31:57,611 --> 00:32:00,613
We're born with them
and we'll die with them.

456
00:32:00,614 --> 00:32:03,617
You mean like a Adam and Eve
kind of sin?

457
00:32:03,618 --> 00:32:05,401
I mean sins you can't shake.

458
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:07,273
Saw 'em off,

459
00:32:07,534 --> 00:32:09,362
and they just grow back.

460
00:32:11,712 --> 00:32:14,236
I'm speaking metaphorically,
of course.

461
00:32:19,285 --> 00:32:21,721
Friendly folks around here.

462
00:32:21,722 --> 00:32:24,159
Salt of the damn earth.

463
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:27,946
Maybe you can
help me with something, Cora.

464
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,686
I'll try.

465
00:32:30,687 --> 00:32:33,342
I've been studying spells.

466
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,040
What makes them tick?

467
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:37,825
It's more than
just the words, right? I mean,

468
00:32:37,826 --> 00:32:40,044
an incantation on its own does
nothing.

469
00:32:40,045 --> 00:32:44,136
Well, in my case, I sold
my mortal soul off to the Devil.

470
00:32:44,745 --> 00:32:47,704
So that probably helps
grease the wheels some.

471
00:32:48,096 --> 00:32:49,271
Right.

472
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:51,404
Besides that?

473
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,802
Needs to touch your heart.

474
00:33:00,761 --> 00:33:02,545
When I do a hex,

475
00:33:03,764 --> 00:33:06,027
I think of the saddest
thing I can.

476
00:33:07,202 --> 00:33:10,510
That seems to make
the magic come on stronger.

477
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,560
Ain't none of my business,

478
00:33:18,648 --> 00:33:19,780
ma'am,

479
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:22,217
have you been trying to do
witch magic?

480
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,090
It's just research.

481
00:33:26,395 --> 00:33:29,442
You want to be real careful
with that.

482
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:51,507
Coal mining country.

483
00:33:51,508 --> 00:33:52,639
Yeah,

484
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,076
whole territory's snake full of
tunnels.

485
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,644
If these woods are alive,

486
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,821
tunnels are like
veins underneath the skin.

487
00:34:18,012 --> 00:34:19,360
Ohh.

488
00:34:19,361 --> 00:34:20,406
What is it?

489
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:21,972
Nothing.

490
00:34:22,756 --> 00:34:25,063
Cora? Cora?

491
00:34:26,586 --> 00:34:27,761
Cora?

492
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:31,460
Cora!?

493
00:34:31,852 --> 00:34:33,636
- Cora?
- Cora?

494
00:34:34,289 --> 00:34:35,682
Cora!

495
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,709
That's interesting.

496
00:35:44,272 --> 00:35:46,144
Ahh!

497
00:36:00,549 --> 00:36:02,116
Arg!

498
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:11,299
Ahh!

499
00:36:11,604 --> 00:36:13,171
Ahh!

500
00:36:32,364 --> 00:36:34,017
Fuck.

501
00:36:37,107 --> 00:36:38,718
Am I dead?

502
00:36:40,546 --> 00:36:42,243
Maybe.

503
00:36:50,295 --> 00:36:52,121
Well,

504
00:36:52,122 --> 00:36:54,037
that's all right.

505
00:36:58,172 --> 00:37:01,654
Everybody knows the devil can't
set foot in no church.

506
00:37:48,483 --> 00:37:50,616
What the hell is this place?

507
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,835
I think you know.

508
00:37:53,836 --> 00:37:57,013
It's your mama, ain't it?

509
00:37:58,841 --> 00:38:01,975
That's news to me.
I've never seen her face.

510
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,547
Yeah, I guess that's her.

511
00:38:09,548 --> 00:38:13,334
She tried to get out
of paying for all them sins.

512
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:16,511
Now she'll have no rest from
tormenting.

513
00:38:17,425 --> 00:38:20,907
She ain't slept a wink for more
days than I know how to count.

514
00:38:24,867 --> 00:38:26,260
Sins?

515
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:29,089
They couldn't have been
that bad,

516
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,220
right?

517
00:38:30,612 --> 00:38:35,312
They were many. Consorted
with demons,

518
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:39,795
flew upon the black goat and
gave herself for the Sabbat,

519
00:38:39,796 --> 00:38:42,842
changed her shape into that of
varmints,

520
00:38:42,843 --> 00:38:45,105
and things unnameable.

521
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,765
He's here.

522
00:39:03,602 --> 00:39:04,820
Wow.

523
00:39:05,299 --> 00:39:07,170
That's a big fucking bird.

524
00:39:07,606 --> 00:39:09,782
Beast takes many forms,

525
00:39:09,783 --> 00:39:11,523
this be but one.

526
00:39:12,001 --> 00:39:13,438
Sweet

527
00:39:14,308 --> 00:39:16,614
Sarah.

528
00:39:16,615 --> 00:39:17,833
What the fuck?

529
00:39:19,095 --> 00:39:20,314
Please.

530
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:23,404
Mercy.

531
00:39:25,537 --> 00:39:28,888
If you will forgive me,
let me go up to God.

532
00:39:29,149 --> 00:39:30,933
To God?

533
00:39:31,281 --> 00:39:35,068
No. This is where you belong.

534
00:39:35,069 --> 00:39:36,917
My Lord.

535
00:39:36,918 --> 00:39:38,767
My master.

536
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:42,075
What more can I give thee?

537
00:39:42,076 --> 00:39:43,946
So much more.

538
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:48,821
Can you not feel
the new life growing inside you?

539
00:39:50,562 --> 00:39:51,867
It can't be possible?

540
00:39:51,868 --> 00:39:53,608
A dark thing.

541
00:39:53,956 --> 00:39:55,609
Malignant.

542
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:57,959
It can't be for I am dead.

543
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,963
You sang out to the deep
of night,

544
00:40:00,964 --> 00:40:03,488
and the night things answered.

545
00:40:03,836 --> 00:40:08,144
Now you will give the
world a gift.

546
00:40:11,844 --> 00:40:13,411
A gift.

547
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,761
A son.

548
00:40:20,548 --> 00:40:23,551
A beautiful son.

549
00:40:30,384 --> 00:40:32,342
Ow.

550
00:40:33,126 --> 00:40:35,607
Woah, easy there, easy.

551
00:40:35,608 --> 00:40:37,477
I'm fine.

552
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:42,004
Oh shit, my head feels
like Minnie Minoso took a swing at it.

553
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:43,658
Ahh.

554
00:40:44,267 --> 00:40:45,443
He brought you back.

555
00:40:48,663 --> 00:40:51,710
Cora. Cora!

556
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:05,463
Cora!

557
00:41:09,423 --> 00:41:11,033
Cora.

558
00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:29,878
I used it.

559
00:41:30,923 --> 00:41:33,491
I used the lucky bone.

560
00:41:34,274 --> 00:41:36,450
If I wasn't a witch before...

561
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:39,888
I surely am now.

562
00:42:15,097 --> 00:42:16,969
There you go, Daddy.

563
00:42:17,317 --> 00:42:18,797
It's consecrated ground.

564
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:21,321
Let's get you inside, you
old sinner.

565
00:42:39,078 --> 00:42:40,993
Reverend.

566
00:42:45,345 --> 00:42:48,609
That you? Tom Ferrell?

567
00:42:50,959 --> 00:42:52,831
How'd you know, Reverend?

568
00:42:52,832 --> 00:42:54,397
She told me.

569
00:42:55,007 --> 00:42:56,050
She?

570
00:42:56,051 --> 00:42:57,748
There's a girl here.

571
00:42:57,749 --> 00:43:01,666
Come in a couple of minutes
before you fellas. Bold as brass.

572
00:43:03,624 --> 00:43:05,887
You don't see her?

573
00:43:09,804 --> 00:43:11,065
Well,

574
00:43:11,066 --> 00:43:13,503
maybe she a ghost.

575
00:43:14,374 --> 00:43:16,594
Is it Cora Fisher?

576
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:18,030
Cora Fisher?

577
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:19,945
Yep.

578
00:43:20,728 --> 00:43:23,949
Remember her when she was just a
little tadpole.

579
00:43:25,298 --> 00:43:27,387
Devil might have got a body,

580
00:43:28,693 --> 00:43:31,260
but he didn't get her soul.

581
00:43:36,439 --> 00:43:39,486
It's y'daddy, ain't it?

582
00:43:39,791 --> 00:43:43,229
Figured he ought to be
buried in proper church ground.

583
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:45,797
So he shall.

584
00:43:46,058 --> 00:43:47,842
All right, Daddy.

585
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:59,288
But I think you got another purpose
for being up here on the Hurricane, don't you?

586
00:43:59,289 --> 00:44:00,550
Yes, sir.

587
00:44:01,029 --> 00:44:02,509
We, uh,

588
00:44:03,423 --> 00:44:05,077
we aim to go up that hill.

589
00:44:05,773 --> 00:44:07,688
You're going to his house?

590
00:44:09,037 --> 00:44:13,520
Now, why would any damn fool
want to do a thing like that for?

591
00:44:23,922 --> 00:44:25,880
My daddy's dead.

592
00:44:25,881 --> 00:44:28,143
Cora

593
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:31,625
You're dead.

594
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:34,889
I'm sorry, girl.

595
00:44:36,499 --> 00:44:39,546
Maybe all that's left to do is
surrender myself to him.

596
00:44:39,938 --> 00:44:41,635
Tell him, take my body,

597
00:44:42,157 --> 00:44:43,550
take my soul,

598
00:44:43,985 --> 00:44:46,292
take your goddamn penny.

599
00:44:48,207 --> 00:44:51,297
Just so long as there's no
more killing on my conscience.

600
00:44:51,906 --> 00:44:53,908
After all, a deal's a deal,
ain't it?

601
00:44:53,909 --> 00:44:55,430
That's ridiculous.

602
00:44:55,431 --> 00:44:57,651
You were just a kid.
A deal with a demonic entity?

603
00:44:57,652 --> 00:44:59,849
How can that possibly
be binding?

604
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:02,047
- Oh, it be binding.
- Hellboy.

605
00:45:02,048 --> 00:45:05,006
Yeah, it's kind of binding.

606
00:45:06,051 --> 00:45:09,054
Look, there may be some
wiggle room.

607
00:45:09,055 --> 00:45:10,533
It's what I'm here for.

608
00:45:10,534 --> 00:45:12,622
To renegotiate.

609
00:45:12,623 --> 00:45:14,711
Negotiate, my ass.

610
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:19,325
Well, he do seem like a pretty persuasive fella,
Reverend, don't he?

611
00:45:19,326 --> 00:45:22,501
Men's pride and folly, all
that is.

612
00:45:22,502 --> 00:45:26,941
Well, if you're gonna go, best do it
when the sun's up in the sky.

613
00:45:26,942 --> 00:45:29,422
His power's strongest when
it's dark.

614
00:45:29,944 --> 00:45:31,510
Y'all stay here tonight.

615
00:45:31,511 --> 00:45:33,382
We got to boogie-woogie, preach.

616
00:45:33,992 --> 00:45:36,211
Looks like we still
have some daylight left.

617
00:45:36,212 --> 00:45:37,822
You sure about that?

618
00:45:47,962 --> 00:45:50,790
That, that's, no,
wait, that's not possible.

619
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:54,447
no, the Earth, the Earth doesn't spin.
It, it, that's not how it works.

620
00:45:56,971 --> 00:46:01,106
We on his time up in the
Hurricane.

621
00:46:11,638 --> 00:46:13,552
We've got company.

622
00:46:13,553 --> 00:46:16,469
A lot of witches around
these parts.

623
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:17,992
Always have been.

624
00:46:18,427 --> 00:46:21,648
Used to be plenty of regular
folks, too.

625
00:46:21,649 --> 00:46:25,695
Nowadays, mostly just witches.

626
00:46:30,352 --> 00:46:32,876
Haha! Hallelujah.

627
00:46:32,877 --> 00:46:37,011
And I will lead the blind
by a way they know not.

628
00:46:38,491 --> 00:46:44,714
And I will make
the darkness light for them.

629
00:46:46,064 --> 00:46:50,198
And the crooked things straight.

630
00:46:50,199 --> 00:46:52,331
Oneiros und Nótt

631
00:46:54,028 --> 00:46:56,248
SchlieBßen Sie ihre Augen

632
00:47:00,513 --> 00:47:02,645
Needs to touch your heart.

633
00:47:03,385 --> 00:47:04,996
When I do a hex.

634
00:47:06,084 --> 00:47:08,913
I think of the saddest
thing I can.

635
00:47:09,174 --> 00:47:13,395
Let not your hearts be troubled.

636
00:47:14,701 --> 00:47:19,837
Them witches. Can't set
foot on this holy ground.

637
00:47:20,359 --> 00:47:22,817
And that black magic.

638
00:47:22,818 --> 00:47:25,276
Ain't no good here.

639
00:47:25,277 --> 00:47:28,280
I guess we'll find out
soon enough.

640
00:47:30,717 --> 00:47:34,373
You doubt the power of
prayers, son?

641
00:47:40,553 --> 00:47:44,600
I just like to have some
excessively high-caliber ammo on hand.

642
00:47:45,297 --> 00:47:47,255
Just in case.

643
00:47:51,085 --> 00:47:54,219
Oh! Sheee. Ha!

644
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,567
Tommy...

645
00:48:16,568 --> 00:48:17,895
Shhh!

646
00:48:18,243 --> 00:48:20,027
Tommy...

647
00:48:20,636 --> 00:48:23,161
I know you can hear me in there.

648
00:48:24,423 --> 00:48:26,773
Ain't you had enough trouble
for one day?

649
00:48:26,774 --> 00:48:30,820
It ain't even really begun.

650
00:48:31,821 --> 00:48:35,129
All your friends in that church
with you,

651
00:48:36,609 --> 00:48:38,350
they all gonna die.

652
00:48:39,046 --> 00:48:41,309
All on your account.

653
00:48:42,267 --> 00:48:44,791
That's why you gotta
come out and face him.

654
00:49:07,074 --> 00:49:10,033
Elvis's ass don't shake
this hard.

655
00:49:10,034 --> 00:49:12,950
Reverend, the coal mines,
do they run under this church?

656
00:49:12,951 --> 00:49:15,256
Oh, they run everywhere.

657
00:49:15,691 --> 00:49:22,568
A coal mine collapsed about 30 years ago.
Last time the ground shook like this.

658
00:49:22,569 --> 00:49:24,243
100 men killed.

659
00:49:24,244 --> 00:49:25,918
Buried alive.

660
00:49:25,919 --> 00:49:28,313
Great place to build a church,
huh, Joe?

661
00:49:30,054 --> 00:49:31,403
Where's Tom?

662
00:49:37,148 --> 00:49:39,541
I don't see what's so
godforsaken funny.

663
00:50:38,426 --> 00:50:43,605
Little Tom Ferrell, come back
to see me.

664
00:50:45,259 --> 00:50:47,479
Bring me my lucky bone.

665
00:50:48,567 --> 00:50:52,745
I come to collect it,
Tom Ferrell.

666
00:50:53,267 --> 00:50:54,790
Yeah and I'm gonna give it
to you.

667
00:50:54,791 --> 00:50:57,315
You gotta make me one promise.

668
00:50:58,142 --> 00:51:01,754
No harm comes
to those good folks in there.

669
00:51:02,711 --> 00:51:06,454
But it was you who put them in
harms way,

670
00:51:07,107 --> 00:51:09,066
not I.

671
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:21,078
All right, then.

672
00:51:23,906 --> 00:51:25,865
All right.

673
00:51:49,193 --> 00:51:51,456
I don't think so.

674
00:51:54,459 --> 00:51:57,549
See, I don't like this deal.

675
00:51:57,550 --> 00:51:58,940
You want it too bad,

676
00:51:58,941 --> 00:52:01,683
and that makes me not want you
to have it.

677
00:52:02,336 --> 00:52:05,165
Go on inside, Tom.

678
00:52:05,166 --> 00:52:06,427
Go.

679
00:52:08,647 --> 00:52:11,737
Well, ain't you
a pug-ugly son of a bitch?

680
00:52:12,694 --> 00:52:15,001
Pot calling the kettle black
here, but

681
00:52:15,002 --> 00:52:17,960
Jesus H.

682
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:30,494
Oh, yeah, that's right.

683
00:52:30,495 --> 00:52:34,890
The nympho-broad in the tree
mentioned you weren't afraid of me.

684
00:52:36,283 --> 00:52:39,199
Well guess what?
I'm not afraid of you either.

685
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,158
So why don't you turn around,

686
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:45,640
take your crooked ass out of here,
and take those dizzy bitches with you.

687
00:52:47,033 --> 00:52:49,643
You had a different aspect

688
00:52:49,644 --> 00:52:52,778
when you watched
your mother burn.

689
00:52:53,692 --> 00:52:55,432
What the hell you say, Gumby?

690
00:52:55,433 --> 00:52:59,350
Be gone from this church,
Mr. Onselm. You be gone now.

691
00:52:59,351 --> 00:53:01,743
You saw how she is.

692
00:53:02,701 --> 00:53:05,007
This sorrowful thing.

693
00:53:05,878 --> 00:53:08,794
She suffers so.

694
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:15,844
But I have it in
my power to mollify her pain.

695
00:53:15,845 --> 00:53:20,109
Let her feathered soul
take wing.

696
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:21,501
Really?

697
00:53:21,502 --> 00:53:23,417
You would do that?

698
00:53:23,418 --> 00:53:24,939
Yeah.

699
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:28,552
Something small in return is
all I ask.

700
00:53:28,553 --> 00:53:33,949
That you twist off the head of
that little Tom Ferrell.

701
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:35,386
and bring it hither.

702
00:53:37,257 --> 00:53:39,454
We're just

703
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:41,653
renegotiating.

704
00:53:44,482 --> 00:53:49,617
I'm sure we can see eye to eye.

705
00:53:50,357 --> 00:53:51,879
Why?

706
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:55,667
You got witch blood in
you, friend.

707
00:53:58,278 --> 00:54:00,475
You're more like me

708
00:54:00,476 --> 00:54:02,674
than you are like them.

709
00:54:03,675 --> 00:54:06,068
Come on, snake, let's rattle.

710
00:54:27,133 --> 00:54:28,700
Ohh!

711
00:54:35,228 --> 00:54:36,534
Help him.

712
00:54:39,363 --> 00:54:42,540
Oh, come on!

713
00:54:53,942 --> 00:54:57,424
Oh! He's kilt. He's kilt
for sure.

714
00:54:58,033 --> 00:55:00,819
Arg! I ain't kilt.

715
00:55:03,648 --> 00:55:06,607
You can't hide in there
forever, Tommy.

716
00:55:06,999 --> 00:55:10,568
Crooked Man gonna wear you
out, boy.

717
00:55:10,569 --> 00:55:13,309
Oh, you shut your cursed mouth.

718
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:17,749
He gonna heap sorrows on you a hundred times
worse than what you drunken

719
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:19,185
daddy ever got.

720
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:23,798
You get out of my skull, you witch!
Witch! Get out of my skull!

721
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:25,844
Ahh!

722
00:55:27,759 --> 00:55:29,020
Joe,

723
00:55:29,021 --> 00:55:31,000
I need you.

724
00:55:31,001 --> 00:55:32,981
Reverend.

725
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:38,683
Now we both know,
Reverend, a deal's a deal.

726
00:55:39,205 --> 00:55:41,685
Here's what I'll do.

727
00:55:41,686 --> 00:55:46,298
I'll buy that lucky bone
from you.

728
00:55:46,299 --> 00:55:50,390
Ain't nothing in here
for sale to you, Mr. Onselm.

729
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:53,610
Do it.

730
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:56,134
Okay.

731
00:55:56,135 --> 00:55:57,615
Urmm! Ahh!

732
00:55:58,659 --> 00:56:01,227
Come on, Joe, you gotta
pull harder.

733
00:56:01,228 --> 00:56:02,228
- Come on!
- Ahh!

734
00:56:04,099 --> 00:56:08,669
Uhh, I know you got no use for
legal tender, old man.

735
00:56:09,235 --> 00:56:11,237
But what about time?

736
00:56:12,238 --> 00:56:14,327
What do you give for

737
00:56:14,849 --> 00:56:16,546
ten years of it?

738
00:56:16,547 --> 00:56:19,419
What are you doing to me, Satan?

739
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:20,594
How about

740
00:56:20,595 --> 00:56:21,769
twenty?

741
00:56:22,161 --> 00:56:24,205
Fix up those

742
00:56:24,206 --> 00:56:27,340
eyes of yours while we're at it.

743
00:56:31,997 --> 00:56:33,694
Come on!

744
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:40,962
No, sir! I come fairly
by my years and my afflictions,

745
00:56:40,963 --> 00:56:43,138
and I don't want nothing else.

746
00:56:48,013 --> 00:56:54,585
Abby Riley done poisoned two husbands.
How'd she get planted in a church yard?

747
00:56:58,937 --> 00:57:05,160
So many sinners
in this consecrated ground.

748
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:22,264
Flesh rots, but the sin goes on.

749
00:57:39,717 --> 00:57:41,239
Oh shit.

750
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,329
Okay, are you sure you're okay?
Because...

751
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:44,983
You want to stick your
finger in?

752
00:57:44,984 --> 00:57:46,026
No I do not.

753
00:57:46,027 --> 00:57:47,420
You can't keep bleeding
like this

754
00:57:47,421 --> 00:57:48,681
I'll be fine.

755
00:57:48,682 --> 00:57:50,815
- No, no, you will not be fine
- Bobbie Jo.

756
00:57:50,816 --> 00:57:52,598
Part of the job.

757
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:57,517
Okay? I can't wait to get my
hands on that <i>Howdy Doody fuck.</i>

758
00:58:19,713 --> 00:58:22,499
Where the hits just keep
on coming.

759
00:58:47,872 --> 00:58:50,396
He looks a little different,
doesn't he?

760
00:58:50,397 --> 00:58:51,440
Mm-hmm.

761
00:58:54,356 --> 00:58:57,882
You always did like them pretty
girls, didn't you, Reverend?

762
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:04,192
I could feel your eyes on
me giving them Sunday sermons.

763
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:09,720
You go lay back down, Abigail.
This ain't your world no more.

764
00:59:13,767 --> 00:59:15,855
Kiss me, Father.

765
00:59:15,856 --> 00:59:19,512
Kiss me like you always
wanted to.

766
00:59:20,774 --> 00:59:23,211
Kiss this.

767
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:33,831
What are you doing?

768
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:37,312
Callie Hicks, fornicator.

769
00:59:37,313 --> 00:59:39,140
Fornicator!

770
00:59:43,884 --> 00:59:46,038
Abel Jacobs.

771
00:59:46,039 --> 00:59:48,193
Gambler.

772
00:59:49,281 --> 00:59:51,565
Josie Ward.

773
00:59:51,566 --> 00:59:53,851
Philanderer.

774
00:59:56,201 --> 00:59:58,986
Manly Langrishe.

775
00:59:58,987 --> 01:00:01,293
Lying drunk.

776
01:00:01,294 --> 01:00:03,600
Lying drunk!

777
01:00:09,344 --> 01:00:11,608
Nathan Green.

778
01:00:12,086 --> 01:00:15,611
Murderer.

779
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,657
Like ducks at the county fair.

780
01:00:17,658 --> 01:00:19,746
Flora Sue Baker.

781
01:00:20,051 --> 01:00:21,661
Cheatin' whore.

782
01:00:22,706 --> 01:00:24,577
Cheatin' whore.

783
01:00:25,099 --> 01:00:26,623
Ada Calder.

784
01:00:27,232 --> 01:00:30,538
Child killer.

785
01:00:36,415 --> 01:00:38,896
They were dead, and buried.

786
01:00:38,897 --> 01:00:40,767
Sins were forgiven.

787
01:00:41,028 --> 01:00:43,422
Forgiven don't mean forgotten.

788
01:00:44,075 --> 01:00:46,120
Wyatt Ferrell.

789
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,557
Drunken old fool.

790
01:00:49,167 --> 01:00:51,212
Ha ha ha.

791
01:00:51,213 --> 01:00:52,736
Agsk

792
01:00:53,171 --> 01:00:54,040
Ugh!

793
01:00:54,041 --> 01:00:56,565
What is this?

794
01:00:59,917 --> 01:01:01,527
No, wait, wait.

795
01:01:05,705 --> 01:01:07,228
Fuck.

796
01:01:24,158 --> 01:01:25,943
Sorry Daddy.

797
01:01:26,552 --> 01:01:29,903
Lord, I can't look on this
no more.

798
01:01:29,904 --> 01:01:32,993
Take my eyes away.

799
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:37,084
And I don't want no gifts from
the devil.

800
01:01:44,135 --> 01:01:46,006
Thank you, Lord.

801
01:01:58,105 --> 01:01:59,803
Tom Ferrell!

802
01:02:00,107 --> 01:02:02,195
Give me that old cat bone!

803
01:02:02,196 --> 01:02:04,720
I was never gonna use it,
Reverend.

804
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,245
You watch now. I ain't no
perfect man.

805
01:02:07,593 --> 01:02:09,028
None of us is.

806
01:02:09,029 --> 01:02:12,293
I got a shadow in
my heart like anyone else.

807
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:15,644
But you gonna see that light,
Tom Ferrell.

808
01:02:17,255 --> 01:02:21,259
You gonna let it
blaze bright inside of you.

809
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:23,827
Just like that light be
blazing in me.

810
01:02:33,358 --> 01:02:35,925
I'm all fired up.

811
01:02:35,926 --> 01:02:38,929
I'm gonna bust that evil
wide open.

812
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:40,408
I'm gonna squeeze it.

813
01:02:41,279 --> 01:02:44,325
I'm gonna squeeze the
Holy Spirit

814
01:02:44,326 --> 01:02:48,808
into this vile unlucky bone!

815
01:02:48,809 --> 01:02:50,896
I can feel it.

816
01:02:50,897 --> 01:02:53,987
Look at it blaze, Tom Ferrell.

817
01:02:53,988 --> 01:02:55,423
Look at it!

818
01:02:58,252 --> 01:03:02,039
Every grave in this yards

819
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:03,910
been dug with this shovel.

820
01:03:07,871 --> 01:03:10,047
If it ain't full of God

821
01:03:10,525 --> 01:03:13,311
then nothing is.

822
01:03:20,187 --> 01:03:23,408
Thy rod and thy staff!

823
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,585
They comfort me.

824
01:03:26,846 --> 01:03:28,108
That'll work.

825
01:03:33,853 --> 01:03:35,463
Yep.

826
01:04:16,635 --> 01:04:19,420
He's going home.

827
01:04:21,031 --> 01:04:22,901
Ah-ah. Hellboy, no.

828
01:04:22,902 --> 01:04:26,210
We call this in and come back
with the whole team from the bureau.

829
01:04:26,211 --> 01:04:27,907
Better to finish this.
He's hurt.

830
01:04:28,168 --> 01:04:29,299
He's weak.

831
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,388
Joe, you're done.

832
01:04:31,389 --> 01:04:33,521
Staying back here
with the Reverend.

833
01:04:33,522 --> 01:04:35,696
- No.
- We don't come back,

834
01:04:35,697 --> 01:04:38,918
you keep going down that mountain
and you don't stop until you find a telephone.

835
01:04:40,746 --> 01:04:42,530
Don't ever come back here.

836
01:04:45,446 --> 01:04:47,144
What?

837
01:04:52,932 --> 01:04:54,891
Keep the shovel.

838
01:05:08,513 --> 01:05:11,168
It's been called
that since I can remember.

839
01:05:11,646 --> 01:05:15,607
A long time back a hurricane blew down
a mess of trees on this mountain.

840
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,609
They never grew back.

841
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:20,263
No one still alive remembers it.

842
01:05:20,264 --> 01:05:22,962
Might have been a thousand years
ago for all I know.

843
01:05:22,963 --> 01:05:25,356
And hell, maybe
it wasn't no hurricane at all.

844
01:05:25,357 --> 01:05:27,097
How's that?

845
01:05:27,098 --> 01:05:28,489
Well,

846
01:05:28,881 --> 01:05:31,014
the Indians say it's always
been bad.

847
01:05:31,492 --> 01:05:35,105
They say there's ghosts and
critters up here older than the flood.

848
01:05:35,106 --> 01:05:39,283
Scarce animals.
Shonokins. Mountain spirits.

849
01:05:39,674 --> 01:05:41,153
Here me out,

850
01:05:41,154 --> 01:05:45,593
I might be just talking
out of my ass here, but

851
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:48,205
might be looking at a
dimensional rifting.

852
01:05:48,509 --> 01:05:51,338
Lovecraft type scenario.

853
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:55,516
The old gods forcing their way
into our world type thing.

854
01:05:55,517 --> 01:05:57,648
I don't know nothing about
that, but

855
01:05:57,649 --> 01:06:00,130
it's a queer, bad feeling place,
that's for sure.

856
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,317
Gonna need a new shovel.

857
01:06:15,536 --> 01:06:17,756
Something in these hills.

858
01:06:17,757 --> 01:06:19,323
Something haunted.

859
01:06:19,324 --> 01:06:20,889
Evil.

860
01:06:21,194 --> 01:06:22,390
In the trees.

861
01:06:22,391 --> 01:06:23,588
In the dirt.

862
01:06:28,462 --> 01:06:31,291
Tom said these hills
were like a living thing.

863
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:33,859
Come again?

864
01:06:34,642 --> 01:06:37,645
He said the old mines were like
its circulatory system.

865
01:06:37,646 --> 01:06:39,430
Its veins running underground.

866
01:06:40,866 --> 01:06:42,520
The Crooked Man, I think,

867
01:06:43,129 --> 01:06:45,696
I think he draws power from it.

868
01:06:45,697 --> 01:06:47,481
You got something
on your mind, girl?

869
01:06:47,482 --> 01:06:49,004
Something I don't like.

870
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:52,008
Maybe if we disrupt the power
source, we can hurt him.

871
01:06:52,009 --> 01:06:53,748
What?

872
01:07:02,279 --> 01:07:04,802
I'm talking about sabotage.

873
01:07:04,803 --> 01:07:08,589
If this were a war and those tunnels were
supply lines, we'd plant dynamite.

874
01:07:08,981 --> 01:07:11,070
You gonna dynamite that mine?

875
01:07:11,071 --> 01:07:12,332
No.

876
01:07:13,464 --> 01:07:15,074
Maybe something better.

877
01:07:15,466 --> 01:07:16,597
A spell.

878
01:07:18,817 --> 01:07:20,600
Girl,

879
01:07:20,601 --> 01:07:23,213
You outta your mother
fucking mind.

880
01:07:31,525 --> 01:07:33,179
I didn't know if it was real,

881
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:37,749
or if it was just a story they
tell little chaps to scare them.

882
01:07:41,753 --> 01:07:43,972
You ready?

883
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:47,715
They told me them stories too.

884
01:08:17,223 --> 01:08:19,617
Could use a woman's touch.

885
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:33,805
They go down into them mines.

886
01:08:39,985 --> 01:08:41,465
Make me understand

887
01:08:42,248 --> 01:08:44,120
why they built a church

888
01:08:44,685 --> 01:08:47,601
on top of a very
convenient access

889
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,648
to a collapsed coal mine?

890
01:08:51,214 --> 01:08:53,259
Explain it to me
like I'm a little...

891
01:08:54,347 --> 01:08:56,001
a little slow.

892
01:08:56,002 --> 01:08:57,088
Wha-

893
01:08:57,089 --> 01:08:59,046
S'ppose they thought

894
01:08:59,047 --> 01:09:01,701
it was some kind of doorway

895
01:09:01,702 --> 01:09:05,488
'tween this world and the other.

896
01:09:05,489 --> 01:09:09,101
They reckon they'd drop a
church on top.

897
01:09:09,884 --> 01:09:11,494
Consecrate the soil.

898
01:09:11,495 --> 01:09:13,105
Block the doorway.

899
01:09:14,498 --> 01:09:16,195
Maybe not such a swell idea.

900
01:09:16,674 --> 01:09:19,720
Worked all right up until today.

901
01:09:22,506 --> 01:09:24,072
It's dark down there.

902
01:09:25,596 --> 01:09:28,164
Dark as the devil's asshole.

903
01:09:29,730 --> 01:09:31,732
If we're going...

904
01:09:33,647 --> 01:09:35,258
I'm bringing this along.

905
01:09:36,389 --> 01:09:39,566
Maybe it got a bit of holy
left in it.

906
01:09:39,567 --> 01:09:40,611
We?

907
01:09:41,481 --> 01:09:43,657
- No, Reverend, I...
- Down there,

908
01:09:44,005 --> 01:09:46,965
I ain't much more blind than you
is, girl.

909
01:11:17,664 --> 01:11:21,364
I always figured rich folks had
them some real fine soirees.

910
01:11:22,582 --> 01:11:24,192
Mm-hmm.

911
01:11:24,497 --> 01:11:26,238
Real fine.

912
01:11:27,674 --> 01:11:29,894
All right.

913
01:11:56,747 --> 01:11:58,183
Tom!

914
01:12:24,775 --> 01:12:27,973
Bet you wishing your friend
was here.

915
01:12:27,974 --> 01:12:31,172
Yeah, he's not afraid of
anything.

916
01:12:31,434 --> 01:12:33,610
Oh, I know somethin' afraid of:

917
01:12:34,088 --> 01:12:37,701
he afraid to tell you how
he really feels about you.

918
01:12:44,882 --> 01:12:47,493
Tom?

919
01:12:49,582 --> 01:12:51,497
Tom.

920
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:55,153
Ahh!

921
01:13:02,682 --> 01:13:04,641
Something's coming.

922
01:13:14,172 --> 01:13:15,565
Ahh!

923
01:13:20,613 --> 01:13:22,398
Run, girl!

924
01:13:25,183 --> 01:13:27,445
Hurry up! This way, this way!

925
01:13:27,446 --> 01:13:31,494
And he shall eat the flesh of
your sons,

926
01:13:31,495 --> 01:13:33,626
and the flesh of your daughters

927
01:13:34,714 --> 01:13:35,932
shall he eat.

928
01:13:35,933 --> 01:13:38,196
Destroy them in wrath.

929
01:13:38,762 --> 01:13:40,284
Destroy them

930
01:13:40,285 --> 01:13:43,810
that they may be no more.

931
01:13:49,381 --> 01:13:51,949
Magic ain't like a bullet, girl.

932
01:13:52,210 --> 01:13:54,603
You just can't pull the trigger.

933
01:13:54,604 --> 01:13:58,172
Some things you
can't understand by thinking.

934
01:13:58,173 --> 01:14:01,698
It comes from the spirits, not
the meat!

935
01:14:02,046 --> 01:14:03,874
Ahh!

936
01:14:30,117 --> 01:14:31,641
Ahh!

937
01:14:31,945 --> 01:14:33,512
Oh, crap.

938
01:14:33,513 --> 01:14:35,383
Ahh!

939
01:15:07,938 --> 01:15:11,028
When's the last time you felt
the touch of a woman, Tommy?

940
01:15:12,769 --> 01:15:16,119
Have all these years been so
lonesome?

941
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:19,471
Did you sit up and dream
about me?

942
01:15:21,734 --> 01:15:28,698
I know it, I bet you never stopped thinking
about the way I touched you.

943
01:15:29,786 --> 01:15:32,136
You got something hard for
me, Tommy?

944
01:15:32,484 --> 01:15:34,486
Yeah, I do.

945
01:15:39,839 --> 01:15:41,188
Ahh!

946
01:16:15,788 --> 01:16:19,357
I know well thou are my son.

947
01:16:21,228 --> 01:16:23,404
Thine eyes,

948
01:16:24,667 --> 01:16:27,974
thine eyes attest to it.

949
01:16:28,627 --> 01:16:31,369
Let's not pretend this
is some beautiful moment.

950
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:34,066
I don't care about you.

951
01:16:34,067 --> 01:16:36,155
You never gave a damn about me.

952
01:16:36,156 --> 01:16:38,681
Thou should look upon
me and say these things?

953
01:16:38,682 --> 01:16:40,378
I should let you burn!

954
01:16:45,296 --> 01:16:47,603
I gotta get you out of here.

955
01:16:47,604 --> 01:16:49,169
No, my sweet child.

956
01:16:49,170 --> 01:16:50,736
I can't be saved.

957
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:53,913
This burning be my fate.

958
01:16:57,177 --> 01:17:00,050
For them many sins I done,

959
01:17:01,138 --> 01:17:04,141
all us witches end up the same.

960
01:17:37,609 --> 01:17:40,133
There's only one way to end
this pain.

961
01:17:42,048 --> 01:17:44,224
Destroy me, my son.

962
01:17:44,225 --> 01:17:45,355
No.

963
01:17:45,356 --> 01:17:46,965
No, I can't do that.

964
01:17:46,966 --> 01:17:48,446
You can't ask me to do that.

965
01:17:48,447 --> 01:17:50,078
For thy scorn.

966
01:17:50,079 --> 01:17:51,709
For thy wrath.

967
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:54,060
Thou were right to hate me.

968
01:17:54,061 --> 01:17:55,845
I hated myself!

969
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,411
Myself!

970
01:17:58,412 --> 01:18:01,633
This goddam monster you made!

971
01:18:25,004 --> 01:18:29,225
Oneiros und Nótt, beruührt die
Gedanken meiner Feinde.

972
01:18:29,226 --> 01:18:33,447
SchlieBßen Sie ihre Augen
und fangen sie bis zum naächsten

973
01:18:34,057 --> 01:18:37,538
Sonnenaufgang in Traäaumen ein.
Oneiros und Nótt, beruührt die Gedanken

974
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:41,629
chlieBßen Sie ihre Augen
und fangen sie bis zum naächsten

975
01:18:42,587 --> 01:18:44,894
Oneiros und Nótt,
beruührt die Gedanken

976
01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:49,420
Sie ihre Augen...

977
01:18:49,942 --> 01:18:51,857
Let me be as a dream.

978
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:54,642
Forgotten,

979
01:18:55,905 --> 01:18:57,602
Dust without meaning.

980
01:19:01,954 --> 01:19:05,435
Oneiros und Nótt, beruührt die
Gedanken meiner Feinde.

981
01:19:05,436 --> 01:19:08,918
SchlieBßen Sie ihre Augen
und fangen sie bis zum naächsten

982
01:19:10,223 --> 01:19:12,834
- There's gotta be another way.
- There is none.

983
01:19:12,835 --> 01:19:16,229
Oneiros und Nótt, beruührt die
Gedanken meiner Feinde.

984
01:19:16,230 --> 01:19:19,624
SchlieBßen Sie ihre Augen
und fangen sie bis zum naächsten

985
01:19:19,625 --> 01:19:21,365
Sonnenaufgang in Traäaumen ein.

986
01:19:22,192 --> 01:19:26,022
This agony, I can't bare it
any longer.

987
01:19:26,023 --> 01:19:28,024
- Please!
- No!

988
01:19:28,025 --> 01:19:30,026
Ahh!!

989
01:19:36,946 --> 01:19:39,296
Ahh!!

990
01:19:57,053 --> 01:19:59,903
You alright, big fella?

991
01:19:59,904 --> 01:20:02,754
Some kind of booby trap.

992
01:20:04,408 --> 01:20:05,669
A spell.

993
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:06,932
I almost...

994
01:20:08,064 --> 01:20:09,630
something broke it.

995
01:21:12,041 --> 01:21:14,130
It smells like death,

996
01:21:14,913 --> 01:21:16,784
and bird shit.

997
01:21:17,394 --> 01:21:18,961
Wait here.

998
01:22:07,226 --> 01:22:08,532
Oh crap.

999
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:41,608
No, no, no, no.

1000
01:22:42,696 --> 01:22:43,871
No, no.

1001
01:22:44,698 --> 01:22:48,398
Please, please, fuck!

1002
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:42,626
Ahhh!

1003
01:23:44,541 --> 01:23:45,759
Gah! Ahh!

1004
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:50,373
Ugh.

1005
01:23:59,469 --> 01:24:01,427
Egh! Guh!

1006
01:24:02,298 --> 01:24:03,429
Oh! Ahh!

1007
01:24:14,005 --> 01:24:15,093
Uah!

1008
01:24:21,447 --> 01:24:26,604
Better you'd given me that boy's
head when you had the offer.

1009
01:24:26,605 --> 01:24:31,762
That's twice you might have
saved your fork-tongued mother.

1010
01:24:35,331 --> 01:24:39,378
Well, but you'll be
by her side soon enough,

1011
01:24:39,379 --> 01:24:43,903
suckling that black teat
in hell.

1012
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:49,258
You must die in this house
to feed the earth beneath,

1013
01:24:49,259 --> 01:24:51,607
to feed these hills,

1014
01:24:51,608 --> 01:24:56,178
these ancient stones that
do live.

1015
01:24:56,526 --> 01:24:58,223
Hey there, devil,

1016
01:25:00,312 --> 01:25:01,966
I got something for you.

1017
01:25:05,143 --> 01:25:06,971
That's for Cora Fisher.

1018
01:25:07,841 --> 01:25:09,147
You go on and choke on it,

1019
01:25:09,148 --> 01:25:10,496
son of a bitch.

1020
01:25:59,502 --> 01:26:02,069
Look at this devil,

1021
01:26:03,201 --> 01:26:07,988
fools himself into thinking
he's a man.

1022
01:26:11,905 --> 01:26:16,954
Your road ends in the dark
like mine.

1023
01:26:18,782 --> 01:26:19,957
And this,

1024
01:26:20,566 --> 01:26:21,740
witch,

1025
01:26:21,741 --> 01:26:22,872
No I ain't.

1026
01:26:22,873 --> 01:26:26,028
You'll burn, both of ya.

1027
01:26:26,029 --> 01:26:29,184
Like Cora Fisher burns.

1028
01:26:29,706 --> 01:26:32,274
Like your witch mother burns.

1029
01:26:32,665 --> 01:26:34,319
That's all for you.

1030
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,766
It's all souls, ain't it?

1031
01:26:57,821 --> 01:26:59,475
Look at it.

1032
01:27:00,563 --> 01:27:01,955
You think that one's mine?

1033
01:27:01,956 --> 01:27:03,740
I don't know.

1034
01:27:05,002 --> 01:27:07,265
Guess you'll find out someday.

1035
01:27:09,789 --> 01:27:11,922
Like all of us.

1036
01:27:23,499 --> 01:27:25,327
You know what I think, Tom?

1037
01:27:26,763 --> 01:27:30,070
I think that
so-called lucky bone of yours,

1038
01:27:30,723 --> 01:27:33,378
I think it's just a cat bone.

1039
01:27:35,554 --> 01:27:38,122
All this time you
thought it held the power, but

1040
01:27:39,645 --> 01:27:41,952
I think the power was in you.

1041
01:27:44,737 --> 01:27:46,522
He was afraid of you.

1042
01:27:47,523 --> 01:27:49,873
He was right to be.

All of a sudden I'm old.

1048

Tommy...

1049
01:28:22,862 --> 01:28:25,300
I don't know how to be old.

1050
01:28:29,565 --> 01:28:32,349
I knew I held on to

1054

Joe.

1055
01:28:53,284 --> 01:28:55,155
Joe!

1056
01:28:55,156 --> 01:28:57,027
Arrgh!

1057
01:28:59,072 --> 01:29:00,899
Bobbie Jo,

1058
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:04,817
Hey, wake up. Joe, wake up!

1059
01:29:04,818 --> 01:29:06,297
Come on. Come on.

1060
01:29:06,298 --> 01:29:08,343
Get up.

1061
01:29:11,781 --> 01:29:14,349
You went inside the tunnels.

1062
01:29:14,610 --> 01:29:16,437
Unbelievable.

1063
01:29:16,438 --> 01:29:19,136
You're supposed to be the
smart one.

1064
01:29:19,137 --> 01:29:20,746
Yeah, you're telling me.

1065
01:29:23,227 --> 01:29:24,489
Oh, look...

1066
01:29:26,578 --> 01:29:28,580
I got the cargo back.

1067
01:29:28,841 --> 01:29:30,713
Nice field work, right?

1068
01:29:34,151 --> 01:29:36,588
Besides, I wasn't down there
by myself.

1069
01:29:37,328 --> 01:29:39,330
I was with the Reverend the
whole time.

1070
01:29:40,549 --> 01:29:43,073
Never would have
gotten out of there without him.

1071
01:29:52,343 --> 01:29:54,432
I can't wait for the 60s.

1072
01:29:54,433 --> 01:29:56,172
60s, yeah?

1073
01:29:56,173 --> 01:29:58,828
This ain't my decade, Bobbie Jo.

1074
01:29:59,829 --> 01:30:01,700
I feel good times are coming.

1075
01:30:01,701 --> 01:30:04,790
I think so, too.

1076
01:30:06,488 --> 01:30:08,403
I ain't gonna miss this
place much.

1077
01:30:08,751 --> 01:30:10,361
Me neither.

1078
01:30:10,796 --> 01:30:13,320
Can't wait to get
home and just document all this.

1079
01:30:15,366 --> 01:30:17,150
That Tom Ferrell's not a
bad egg.

1080
01:30:17,629 --> 01:30:20,197
Lucky you came along when
you did.

1081
01:30:20,676 --> 01:30:23,461
He just needed a little push,
that's all.

1082
01:30:24,419 --> 01:30:25,375
Hey!

1083
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:30,250
Not afraid of anything, are
you, big guy?

1084
01:30:31,643 --> 01:30:34,516
Yeah, well, there's an upside to
looking like this, Joe.

1085
01:30:35,821 --> 01:30:39,695
You see this face in the mirror long enough
the monsters don't look too bad.

1086
01:30:40,696 --> 01:30:42,306
Yeah, yeah.

1087
01:30:42,698 --> 01:30:44,787
I know something you're afraid
of, though.

1088
01:30:47,093 --> 01:30:48,965
