Help me!

Cho Sung-jae!

8
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,350
Shit.

9
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,490
What do we do?

10
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,920
Mom...

11
00:02:58,258 --> 00:02:59,289
Sorry, sir.

THE ROUNDUP 4: PUNISHMENT

13
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,070
Hey. You hid it there?

14
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,400
Grab him!

15
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,240
- Stay still.
- Let go.

16
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,699
Don't get yourself hurt.

17
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,740
Here it is.

18
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,040
Okay, okay.

19
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,140
Why won't it go?

20
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,250
What's wrong with this?

21
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,760
Turn it off.

22
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,600
- I got the key.
- Okay.

23
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,640
Did you cut the water?

24
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,740
Yeah, I did.

25
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,180
- And the circus box?
- Circuit box, located.

26
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,890
- You guys stay here.
- Yes, sir.

27
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,120
Let's head in.

28
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,019
- Elevators?
- None.

29
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,309
It's the roof floor.

30
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,310
Shit.

31
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,860
This way.

32
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,540
- Should I open it?
- Yeah.

33
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,520
- Alright, don't move!
- Stop you bast--

34
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,430
- What's this?
- Huh?

35
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,559
- Shit, clean it up!
- What's this gate?

36
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,730
Hey, don't move!

37
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,190
Open this, you prick!

38
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,859
- You open it, fucker.
- Rip it off.

39
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,900
Huh? Rip it?

40
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,780
Yeah, rip it off!

41
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,530
- We're gonna need tools.
- Look for some.

42
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,410
Let me.

43
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,880
Wait, it's breaking.

44
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,550
Almost there!

45
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,770
- Bravo!
- Stay still, bastards!

46
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,980
Grab 'em! In the bathroom!

47
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,610
You prick!

48
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,670
Stay still.

49
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,890
You little shit. Know
how dangerous this is?

50
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,520
Got 'em all?

51
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,760
- Yes.
- Good.

52
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,560
- These pricks.
- Lemme see.

53
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,631
So many...

54
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,599
These are hidden everywhere.

55
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:49,787
Look at this.

56
00:06:49,812 --> 00:06:52,724
They use this app to sell drugs.

57
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,917
Find the developer first.

58
00:06:54,942 --> 00:06:55,942
Yes, sir.

59
00:06:56,912 --> 00:06:57,912
<i>New order!</i>

60
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:00,575
- What's that?
- It just came in.

61
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
MAGOK DRUGGIE

62
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,350
Maybe a food delivery?

63
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,970
This is the drug order.

64
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,510
First, let's clean this place up.

65
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,070
One's heading up.

66
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,280
Why's the gate broken?

67
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,960
There must be a reason, right?

68
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,730
Eyes down and shut up, okay?

69
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,810
How many delivery guys do they have?

70
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,340
It never ends.

71
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,570
<i>Another one coming.</i>

72
00:07:53,615 --> 00:07:54,755
Places everyone.

73
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,179
Come on, jerks.

74
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,490
- Eat up, guys.
- Yes, sir.

75
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,090
- Jin-sook!
- Yes?

76
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,413
Some more meat, please.

77
00:08:11,512 --> 00:08:13,046
Here's some pork skirt.

78
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:14,984
Thank you.

79
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:19,741
Thank you always for
coming all the way here.

80
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,968
No, it's because you
have the best food.

81
00:08:22,106 --> 00:08:23,312
- It's so good.
- It is.

82
00:08:23,778 --> 00:08:25,098
Let me know if you need anything.

83
00:08:25,558 --> 00:08:27,054
- Will do.
- Thank you.

84
00:08:28,896 --> 00:08:32,646
Her husband was stabbed on the job.

85
00:08:33,318 --> 00:08:36,686
She raises a kid on her
own while running this place.

86
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:40,352
So-yul!

87
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:41,888
Come here.

88
00:08:43,704 --> 00:08:44,704
Hold on.

89
00:08:46,868 --> 00:08:47,610
Here.

90
00:08:47,686 --> 00:08:50,539
Don't tell your mom.
It's just extra allowance.

91
00:08:50,617 --> 00:08:52,172
- Thank you.
- Good.

92
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:53,947
How adorable.

93
00:08:54,753 --> 00:08:56,384
- Dig in.
- Yes, sir.

94
00:08:57,297 --> 00:08:59,407
What happened with the developer?

95
00:08:59,852 --> 00:09:03,149
His name is Cho Sung-jae, and
we put him on the wanted list.

96
00:09:04,134 --> 00:09:05,572
We got a call earlier.

97
00:09:05,805 --> 00:09:06,805
He's dead.

98
00:09:07,575 --> 00:09:08,579
Dead?

99
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,925
Found dead in the Philippines.

100
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,330
His body was brought
back a couple days ago.

101
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,140
The cause?

102
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,890
Autopsy's tomorrow, so we'll see.

103
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,020
Tomorrow?

104
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,510
Yes.

105
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,979
NATIONAL FORENSIC INSTITUTE

106
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,110
He was severely beaten.

107
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,279
Several ribs were broken.

108
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,610
The immediate cause was
a stab wound by a knife.

109
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,050
It went through his stomach
and pierced his heart.

110
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,980
Anything else we should know?

111
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,189
I checked his records,

112
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,590
It seems like his weight
dropped from 74 to 59kg.

113
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,610
No drugs were detected in his blood.

114
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:51,740
Perhaps he was exposed to
harsh treatment for a long time.

115
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,080
This wasn't an ordinary mugging.

116
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,810
You're policemen?

117
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,460
Yes.

118
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,190
I'm Sung-jae's mom.

119
00:10:11,393 --> 00:10:12,563
I see.

120
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,100
I heard...

121
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,440
he was wanted by the police.

122
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,230
What did he do wrong?

123
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,700
He got a job in the Philippines,
then it got hard to reach him...

124
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,490
Who killed my boy?

125
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,930
Well...

126
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,290
we're not sure yet.

127
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:45,840
Do you know the name of
the company he worked for?

128
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,350
HB Trading Co., I think...

129
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,600
We'll try our best to find out.

130
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,350
We're ready.

131
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,900
- Well...
- Alright.

132
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,270
Please.

133
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,890
Let my son breathe.

134
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,470
Hello, fellas.

135
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,850
- How've you been?
- Not bad.

136
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,980
Here's a gift.

137
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,400
The key to the first crypto coin.

138
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,850
Talk it up when it gets listed, okay?

139
00:11:46,604 --> 00:11:51,065
I heard it's really tough, getting
a new coin onto a big exchange.

140
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:52,509
Can you do it?

141
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,070
Tell him how, Mr. Ko.

142
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,250
I'll be meeting the last reviewer soon.

143
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,120
I'll make sure it goes
well. Don't worry.

144
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,599
Well, let's leave that
to the professional,

145
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,520
and just think about where
to enjoy the rest of your life.

146
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,380
Looks like our shares are sorted out.

147
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,120
I'm trusting you, Mr. Jang.

148
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,200
You were always the IT genius,

149
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,040
so I can count on that, right?

150
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:26,050
Jeez, I'm too old for nicknames!

151
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,510
You heard what happened to Cho?

152
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,440
Don't get any ideas.

153
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,140
Sir.

154
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,440
I added more members,
why's my share the same?

155
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,120
Jang isn't keeping his promise.

156
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,140
We got the new website's location.

157
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,640
- Get ready.
- Yes, sir.

158
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,520
Yes, I'll let him know.

159
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,020
Seok-do.

160
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,229
The cyber team just called.

161
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,550
The drug app's distributor got caught.

162
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,670
Cho wasn't the distributor after all.

163
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:13,170
In college, he made an app,
for students to share papers.

164
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,730
But the source code was open.

165
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,980
To the public.

166
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,320
Well, let's go before it closes.

167
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,569
No, not like a store that's open.

168
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,359
It's called open source.

169
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:31,540
It's software with a source code
that anyone can modify or distribute.

170
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,440
So, you're saying it wasn't Cho.

171
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,899
- Right!
- I just made it confusing.

172
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,570
I checked out Cho's company
in the Philippines.

173
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,910
But the phone number's wrong,
and it's been shut down.

174
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,760
Should we call his
mother to find out more?

175
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,449
Yeah, I'll do it.

176
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,500
Alright.

177
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,500
- Back to work.
- Okay.

178
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:01,479
This is Detective Ma,
Metro Investigations.

179
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,140
Is this Sung-jae's mother?

180
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,230
Where?

181
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,310
Detective Ma?

182
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,190
Yes.

183
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,080
She had no family, so we
held the funeral for her.

184
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,410
And she left this.

185
00:15:28,435 --> 00:15:32,595
PLEASE PUNISH THE MAN WHO KILLED MY SON

186
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,390
It's me.

187
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,470
- Begin shutdown.
- Yes, sir.

188
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,440
Do it.

189
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,160
What's going on?

190
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,450
What's happening?

191
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,260
Fix it!

192
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:53,930
Let's go in.

193
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,410
- Shit.
- You fuckers!

194
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,140
Get out!

195
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,810
You fuckers!

196
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,320
Come out, you bastards!

197
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,070
Out!

198
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,610
I'll blow your heads off!

199
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:32,910
Fuck...

200
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,030
Hey.

201
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,500
Please...

202
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,300
Don't kill me...

203
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,890
When Cho worked in the Philippines,

204
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,019
He synced his account on a cloud.

205
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,270
So there was backed-up data.

206
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,270
What?

207
00:19:21,271 --> 00:19:24,360
It's like syncing data
when you get a new phone.

208
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,900
I never switch phones.

209
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,030
Who has time to re-enter
all those phone numbers?

210
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,910
That's why you sync it.

211
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:38,289
Anyway, Cho made
this in the Philippines?

212
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,120
Right.

213
00:19:39,121 --> 00:19:40,879
But while I was downloading it,

214
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,920
someone hacked into the
cloud and deleted the data.

215
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,480
I couldn't recover the
website's address and name.

216
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,399
Sorry to interrupt,

217
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,740
but shouldn't the cyber
team take care of this?

218
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:57,230
Yeah, Seok-do isn't
really the tech-savvy type.

219
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,619
This is a homicide, so it's our job.

220
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,660
Right.

221
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,570
You find the computer guys,

222
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,000
I'll get the guys behind the job.

223
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,480
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

224
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,589
Where's Captain? Did he go out?

225
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,340
He was just here,

226
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,189
- Tae-su.
- Jeez!

227
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,060
Where are you running off to?

228
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,610
Did you see my proposal?

229
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,770
I didn't!

230
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,489
Propose something
that'll bring results.

231
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:34,279
Why investigate digital
crime all of a sudden?

232
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,190
So you did see it.

233
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,240
Seok-do.

234
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,980
People will laugh if you
investigate digital crime.

235
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,810
Just stick to beating up thugs.

236
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,020
Hey, someone died!

237
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:47,230
I'm a cop, they're bad guys.

238
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,150
Hey. Make a fist.

239
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:51,740
What about it?

240
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,600
Is this a digital fist?

241
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,660
Can it fight digital crime?

242
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,160
Digital?

243
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,900
You know what crowd syncing is?

244
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,420
What is it?

245
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,500
See, you're so ignorant.

246
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,100
You get a new phone,

247
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,820
and a whole crowd comes
to set it up for you.

248
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,690
You don't know a thing.

249
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,359
What crowd?

250
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,360
Stop saying useless crap.

251
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:19,699
The initial setup is done,
and we're ready to roll.

252
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,499
Let's get two cyber team
guys and make a taskforce.

253
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,960
Seok-do, this isn't the kind
of case we can handle.

254
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,220
Captain.

255
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,920
I gotta catch these guys.

256
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,690
CALLER ID: BAEK CHANG-GI

257
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,530
Shit.

258
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:57,730
Chang-gi.

259
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,560
We cleaned up here.

260
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,520
I'll give you admin approval.

261
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,110
How many members have you got?

262
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,860
300,000.

263
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,370
Get 100,000 more, and
I'll up your share by 10%.

264
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,370
Keep your word this time.

265
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,790
Hello?

266
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,780
Fuck, what's with his manners?

267
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,310
NEED ADMIN APPROVAL

268
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,070
USE FINGERPRINT

269
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,910
COMPLETE

270
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,190
Hey, we have new team members.

271
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,780
Let's say hello.

272
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:11,239
I'm Han Ji-su from the cyber
division. Nice to meet you.

273
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,119
I'm Gang Nam-su, digital forensics.

274
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,780
Welcome, let's get started.

275
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:17,789
Come on, listen to them.

276
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,790
It's their first time here.

277
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,130
We've met already.

278
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,330
A few days ago.

279
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,560
This is the casino's main page
that was on Cho's cloud.

280
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:30,730
First, we need to find
out who runs this casino.

281
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,190
But since we're lacking info,
we'll have to start from scratch.

282
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,530
I thought the setup was done.

283
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,500
- The setup is finished.
- Yeah?

284
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,240
- But we're starting over.
- What?

285
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:45,760
Bad guys never stop at just one victim.

286
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,850
We need to catch them
before more people die.

287
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:48,890
Yes.

288
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:57,170
Officer Han, look at this.

289
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,860
Isn't this it?

290
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,540
It looks like it.

291
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,304
EMPEROR'S CASINO

292
00:24:03,305 --> 00:24:04,456
It is.

293
00:24:04,457 --> 00:24:05,580
We found it!

294
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:06,810
Got it?

295
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,730
Take a look here.

296
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,299
What's the name?

297
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,100
Emperor's Casino.
I'll send you the link.

298
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,890
- Try getting the IP address.
- Alright.

299
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,940
INVITATION REQUIRED

300
00:24:19,897 --> 00:24:20,897
Hey,

301
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:24,889
I need an invitation
and approval to sign up.

302
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:28,990
Also, you need to send in game money

303
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,480
before they accept you.

304
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,810
But we have no expense account...

305
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:35,410
Oh, I can take care of that.

306
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,800
- Cap.
- Yeah?

307
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,990
Let's go.

308
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,450
Where?

309
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,900
You won't understand a thing
here anyway, so let's go.

310
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,619
- Where?
- Just come.

311
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,420
Can I come too?

312
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,380
I never had a chance to go on site.

313
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,760
Hey, get her a stab vest

314
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,390
and a loaded gun.

315
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,430
Yes, sir.

316
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,220
What?

317
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,969
Just kidding, come along.

318
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,890
- Come on.
- Thank you!

319
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,970
Jeez...

320
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,460
If I was just a bit late,

321
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,330
I might've missed this show.

322
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:11,820
My god.

323
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,660
This place, you know,

324
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,559
already made a deal with me.

325
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,350
What the hell are you doing here?

326
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,270
Whatever.

327
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,940
This joint, you know,

328
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,480
was always our turf.

329
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,820
What're you blabbering
about, you stupid mophead?

330
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,830
You're a dickhead.

331
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,700
You're the head dick.

332
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,249
Stop it right there.

333
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,410
You little pricks.

334
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,790
Hey, man.

335
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,250
We're busy. So get lost.

336
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,050
You shit!

337
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,100
You crazy?

338
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,539
Hey, you jerks.

339
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,330
Better behave yourselves.
Stand up straight.

340
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,920
Why are your boys so aggressive?

341
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,839
They're newbies.

342
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,379
So they didn't recognize you.

343
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,840
I've been calling you. What's all this?

344
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,469
This jerk keeps crawling
into my territory.

345
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,179
Has no sense of business ethics.

346
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:30,560
No, that's not it. He's the
one butting into my turf.

347
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,310
Wanna die, jerks?

348
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:33,769
- No, no.
- Course not.

349
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:36,360
- Settle it.
- With him?

350
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,569
Officer Han, arrest them.

351
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:39,610
- What?
- Arrest them.

352
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:44,360
- Sorry, man.
- I'm sorry.

353
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,450
Good.

354
00:26:45,451 --> 00:26:47,580
Sharing is caring, right?

355
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,619
Now that you've settled,

356
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,750
pay up.

357
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,660
You, pay 3. You, pay 5.

358
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,750
Why should I pay 5?

359
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,209
- Wanna know?
- Yeah!

360
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:59,880
Pay 2 more and I'll tell you.

361
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,969
- Still wanna know?
- Of course not.

362
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,380
Hand it over.

363
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:09,810
Great.

364
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,350
Okay.

365
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,479
Make an account and
use this for game money.

366
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,690
Yes, sir.

367
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,190
Hey.

368
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,399
Any of your guys been in
the online casino scene?

369
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,439
- No.
- Nope.

370
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,440
None?

371
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,410
Then find one.

372
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,780
Huh?

373
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,820
Let's go.

374
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,500
He keeps getting bigger.

375
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,810
Must be from grubbing money.

376
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,090
Shit...

377
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,770
Yu-seong!

378
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,310
Why are there more clothes?

379
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,689
Jang needed more cash,

380
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,810
So we had to get more stuff to launder.

381
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,440
Don't send him the money.

382
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,150
That'll put me in a difficult spot.

383
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,880
Alright.

384
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,620
I'm loyal to you, Mr. Baek.

385
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:25,369
Take care of the developer
for our new building,

386
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,119
then I'll pay you $1 million.

387
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,330
Don't worry.

388
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:36,418
Just keep watch for a few days.

389
00:28:36,443 --> 00:28:36,972
Yes.

390
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,510
Wow, great appetite.

391
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,260
You starve or something?

392
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,970
CALLER ID: BAEK CHANG-GI

393
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,850
Chang-gi.

394
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,320
We got the goods.

395
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,890
Hey you didn't have to call.

396
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,469
You haven't raised my share yet.

397
00:28:56,048 --> 00:28:57,498
You don't want your money?

398
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,480
Send me the money first.

399
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:04,770
You've got a hefty cut already,
no need to haggle for more.

400
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,480
Don't be such a wuss and send it now.

401
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,370
You talk too much.

402
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,920
This is...

403
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,480
my last--

404
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,709
Yes! I hung up first, you bastard!

405
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:19,290
How dare an employee
haggle with the boss!

406
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,560
Let's head to Korea.

407
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,935
Stay healthy, soon you'll
be rolling in dough.

408
00:29:30,746 --> 00:29:31,826
Yes, sir.

409
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,490
- Mr. Kwon.
- Yes, sir.

410
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,120
Have you ever run a casino?

411
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,700
- A casino?
- Yeah.

412
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:44,580
One of my boys isn't cooperating,
so we need a shakeup.

413
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,920
I'll do whatever you ask.

414
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,920
See you.

415
00:29:50,228 --> 00:29:51,268
Yessir.

416
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,979
What a pain in the ass.

417
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:06,440
Sorry for talking about
work while we're eating.

418
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,369
Any progress yet?

419
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:13,700
We've used up all the money
to sign up for more accounts.

420
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:16,430
Other than that, not
much we can find out.

421
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,840
You keep saying that.

422
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,790
My superiors are demanding results.

423
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:24,050
They use overseas IP address,

424
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,570
so it's hard to trace.

425
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,730
If we had a peek into
their internal workings,

426
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,760
that'd help us get started.

427
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:32,940
Seok-do.

428
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,060
Did those thugs call yet?

429
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,570
Shoot.

430
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,400
Oh, right.

431
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,360
Hurry, hurry!

432
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,690
Hello, sir.

433
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,520
Wanna die?

434
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,859
Why didn't you call?

435
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,770
I was just going to.

436
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:53,650
<i>I know one guy. He ran a casino,</i>

437
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:58,160
then took it online and
went completely bust.

438
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,330
Who is it?

439
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,020
Baby, thanks for the gift.

440
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,940
Sorry about yesterday.

441
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,569
You know I'm crazy about you? So hot.

442
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:26,650
Gimme a break.

443
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,870
Good afternoon, sir.

444
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,780
Did you rig the new machines?

445
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,200
Yes, they're all ready.

446
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,290
Show me.

447
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,960
Hold my Gucci.

448
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,390
8000!

449
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,099
A new record, again!

450
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,019
I made sure it won't go past 8000--

451
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,730
Hey, lower it to 7000.

452
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:00,230
Hurt their pride, then people--

453
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,150
That's my car.

454
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:06,620
Who the fuck touches my car?

455
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:08,490
Who are you?

456
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,840
Move your car, jerk.
It's parked illegally.

457
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,610
Fuck this shit.

458
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,300
How'd you know I was here?

459
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,389
Look at this bastard,

460
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:34,510
now ripping people off
with rigged machines.

461
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:37,019
This oldie's preaching at me again.

462
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,330
Who says I rigged this thing?

463
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,210
This is a democratic nation.

464
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,030
- You didn't rig it?
- No.

465
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,730
Turn it on.

466
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,189
- Don't!
- Move aside.

467
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,150
- Move.
- Stop.

468
00:32:47,151 --> 00:32:49,360
- Please don't.
- Step aside.

469
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,870
What the...

470
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,130
You weren't lying.

471
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,500
Sorry I didn't believe you.

472
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,600
Come, we gotta go somewhere.

473
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,970
You're dragging me into trouble again.

474
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:10,420
I won't go!

475
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,010
You know how much I make per hour?

476
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,640
Almost got killed last time.

477
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,810
What do I get for helping you?

478
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,080
Start walking if you
wanna keep that car.

479
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:26,360
That's it? After all we've been though?

480
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:28,440
Come on.

481
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,950
That motherfucker.

482
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,620
Not coming?

483
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,700
I'm coming.

484
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:35,870
My Gucci.

485
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,160
Better give us straight answers.

486
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:45,399
I ran an online casino once
hoping it'd rake in big bucks.

487
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,150
How'd you build the software?

488
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,280
What am I, Steve Jobs?
I bought it, obviously.

489
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,449
How?

490
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:57,830
To save money, some places kidnap
programmers and force them to work.

491
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,910
But not me.

492
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,040
I set up an office overseas,

493
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:05,460
hired legit staff, and ran
it clean, by the book.

494
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,200
Everything you just
said is illegal, dipshit.

495
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,010
Know this site?

496
00:34:14,641 --> 00:34:15,859
Sure, I do.

497
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:19,480
That's what got me
into that damn business.

498
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:21,930
You know how much they make?

499
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:25,050
$200,000 a day. What's that in a year?

500
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:27,170
$73 million.

501
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,780
Here.

502
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,150
Take a look.

503
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:34,559
These restaurants all look different,

504
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,180
but one place runs them.

505
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,610
They run the whole show.

506
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,570
It's a monopoly.

507
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:45,370
In online casinos, live
feeds bring in the real cash.

508
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,660
Wouldn't you rather play live?

509
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:50,500
We wouldn't play at all, idiot.

510
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:53,329
Where'd you run the server?

511
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:55,000
Is she serious?

512
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,670
In the Philippines.

513
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:58,210
For how long?

514
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,300
Thanks for asking.

515
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:03,180
I wouldn't be so
upset if it lasted longer.

516
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:07,140
After 3 days, some bastards came,
and trashed the whole place.

517
00:35:07,165 --> 00:35:09,394
I almost got killed too.

518
00:35:09,651 --> 00:35:11,019
Where are those bastards?

519
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:14,020
How the hell do I know?
I'm not a detective.

520
00:35:15,433 --> 00:35:17,625
But I know where their agent is.

521
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:18,650
Where?

522
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,130
You guys don't know anything?

523
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,449
How do you catch bad guys?

524
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:26,650
Tell us.

525
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,950
For stuff like this,

526
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,130
you gotta bring in
an expert like myself.

527
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,870
Spill it, now.

528
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,750
Let's see.

529
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,600
Samseong-dong.

530
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:41,870
Yeah?

531
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,460
Let's move!

532
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:44,690
Yes, sir.

533
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,610
Hey, you're coming too.

534
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:49,560
- What for?
- Now.

535
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,930
- Be safe, everyone.
- Yes, sir.

536
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,940
Here comes more trouble.

537
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,140
- Go ahead.
- One more for Banker.

538
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,560
Three. Banker wins.

539
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:24,310
How's it going in there?

540
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,270
I'm fucked.

541
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:33,020
We only have $5,000
left. Let's focus, okay?

542
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,900
Are you kidding me?

543
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:38,081
Patience is key. Don't you detectives--

544
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,240
Honey.

545
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:43,660
Pull yourself together, please.

546
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,960
You okay?

547
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,620
Watch what you say.

548
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,250
Back it up.

549
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,420
Alright.

550
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,720
Real men play big. Going all in.

551
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,140
What are you doing?

552
00:36:58,141 --> 00:36:59,630
Win big or bust.

553
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,390
- Stop--
- Shut it.

554
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:02,860
Call it.

555
00:37:02,861 --> 00:37:04,020
Player zero.

556
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,980
Banker nine. Banker wins.

557
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,739
I'm fucked.

558
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,900
Let's go.

559
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:13,490
My Gucci.

560
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,080
Thanks.

561
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,460
Gimme a whiskey.

562
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:27,629
These tiny bets are killing the vibe.

563
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,710
So lame.

564
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,300
Know any bigger place, baby?

565
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,140
Baby?

566
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,429
Ever rode in a Porsche?

567
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,430
Sir.

568
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,940
You're bored here, right? No thrill.

569
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,940
Yeah.

570
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:52,280
Compared to Vegas,
this place is a total yawn.

571
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,320
Should I show you another place?

572
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,580
I know a great one.

573
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,550
You sure?

574
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:08,650
Yes.

575
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,800
He took the bait. Get ready.

576
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,090
Check this out.

577
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,660
You can play live on your phone.

578
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,180
I'll help you sign up.

579
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,730
Baccarat, Hold 'em,
Badugi. We've got it all.

580
00:38:25,793 --> 00:38:26,793
Hey.

581
00:38:28,204 --> 00:38:29,321
- Is this a joke?
- Sorry?

582
00:38:29,699 --> 00:38:32,900
I want the real deal,
not this small-time stuff.

583
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,160
Fuck this.

584
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,910
Hey, ease up there.

585
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,789
Let me handle it, I've got this...

586
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,289
Sir, please wait.

587
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,290
Baby?

588
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,710
Let's hear him out, okay?

589
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,249
- Shall we, baby?
- Yes.

590
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,919
- Sure.
- Let him talk.

591
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,920
Why the rush, sir?

592
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,980
<i>In that case, we've got a VIP program</i>

593
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:59,359
on our website called Emperor's Casino.

594
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,700
But...

595
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,030
the minimum bet is quite high.

596
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,140
Shit, he thinks we can't afford it.

597
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,240
How much?

598
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,160
One million.

599
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,370
One million? What do
you say, Detective?

600
00:39:11,254 --> 00:39:12,004
Shit.

601
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:13,205
You idiot!

602
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:13,875
Cops!

603
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,770
Get him.

604
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:16,440
Stop them.

605
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:21,780
Don't move!

606
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:22,990
Step back.

607
00:39:22,991 --> 00:39:25,070
Get away from me!

608
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,580
Put it down!

609
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,409
You bastard! Grab his arm!

610
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,540
Knife!

611
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,249
Get off me!

612
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,420
Drop the knife--

613
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,170
Want a piece of me?

614
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:42,610
How's your hand?

615
00:39:42,611 --> 00:39:43,690
It's fine.

616
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:44,730
Wake him up.

617
00:39:45,464 --> 00:39:46,503
He's not dead?

618
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:48,175
- Let me see.
- I'm alright.

619
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,820
You're bleeding, you crazy fool.

620
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,950
You're not gonna talk?

621
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:00,540
I told you, I'm just a salesman.

622
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:03,090
Enough with your bulishit.

623
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,730
What the fuck?

624
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,350
Hey, don't look at him.

625
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:13,980
He's a serial killer from China.

626
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,020
I said, don't look! I'm not either.

627
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,230
See my hand?

628
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:21,730
He'll chop off anything he sees.

629
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:26,240
Seems like he lost a lot
of money at your casino.

630
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:29,240
He's out for blood, hunting
for any one of you.

631
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,080
So, you'd better just--

632
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,790
Leave this fucker to me.

633
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:37,710
See?

634
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:40,350
I can protect you as
long as you cooperate.

635
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,599
There's this guy, Choi Yu-seong.

636
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,559
He lets me handle sales.

637
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,190
And he takes 70 percent,
leaving us basically nothing.

638
00:40:50,471 --> 00:40:53,721
70 percent? What an asshole.

639
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:56,279
He's exploiting you.

640
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,280
He's a classic gaslighter.

641
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,070
Where is he now?

642
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:40,149
That's him, right?

643
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:42,150
- Try to be discreet.
- Okay.

644
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,320
YUSEONG APPAREL

645
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,230
Jeez, my back!

646
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,480
He's out of the car.

647
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,070
Should we tail him?

648
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,650
Hold on.

649
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:11,910
Go in.

650
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,310
Excuse me, ma'am.

651
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:25,835
Yes?

652
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,940
Where's Mr. Choi Yu-seong?

653
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,859
We know he's here, so tell us.

654
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,939
Who's asking?

655
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,320
We're the police.

656
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,860
Fuck.

657
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,450
- Wait here.
- Why?

658
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:41,770
Jeez!

659
00:42:41,771 --> 00:42:43,270
Found him, over there!

660
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,979
Hey, stop right there!

661
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,110
Police!

662
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,680
Stop!

663
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,970
Help!

664
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:51,310
You little shit.

665
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,140
Hold 'em back!

666
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,100
Stop!

667
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:56,060
Police! Out of the way.

668
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,820
Hurry!

669
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,530
He's getting away!

670
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,450
Freeze, I said!

671
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,160
Son of a bitch!

672
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,200
Choi Yu-seong!

673
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,250
- Hey!
- Let's go!

674
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:22,060
Why's this car here?

675
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:26,359
There must be a reason, right?

676
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,440
Wait!

677
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:30,530
- Damn, he's quick.
- Well done, sir.

678
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:31,930
Let's go.

679
00:43:31,931 --> 00:43:33,270
Yes, sir.

680
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,980
You scared me.

681
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:01,500
Are all mercenaries like you?

682
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:04,590
Is being sneaky some
professional habit?

683
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,130
My share.

684
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,100
Raise it now.

685
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,110
Why so impatient?

686
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,160
It's too big a pie for me
to eat alone anyway, right?

687
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:19,940
We're planning to list
President Jang's cyber coin.

688
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:23,190
We're almost ready, and
secured the investors too.

689
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,600
If we create buzz using
President Jang's fame,

690
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:28,979
and bring in investors
at the right moment,

691
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,649
the coin's value will
skyrocket in no time.

692
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:34,819
Then people will pour
in like ants to sugar.

693
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:37,069
You see, its huge ups and downs

694
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:39,260
make it so easy to drain their wallets.

695
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:40,490
President Jang.

696
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:42,870
Answer my question.

697
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:45,000
Hey,

698
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,870
listen, will you?

699
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,680
If we nail this, the casino
won't even matter.

700
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,420
You won't have to stash cash anymore,

701
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,730
or ask Choi for help
laundering the casino money.

702
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:57,740
That's right.

703
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:00,610
Maybe he didn't quite get it.

704
00:45:07,515 --> 00:45:08,508
Mr. Ko...

705
00:45:09,217 --> 00:45:12,132
How much time has
that reviewer cost us?

706
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,010
We're still working on him.

707
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:17,310
Other reviewers are all sorted,
he won't hold out long.

708
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:18,980
Exactly.

709
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,190
So move your ass and handle it now.

710
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:24,350
Okay?

711
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,769
Chang-gi, this is great.

712
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:34,649
While you're here, can
you deal with the reviewer?

713
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:37,760
Once we get his approval, it's game on.

714
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,440
Help me on this

715
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:43,070
and you'll get the casino
shares and the admin key!

716
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:50,870
Dong-cheol.

717
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:57,670
Keep your word this time.

718
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,810
Anything yet?

719
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:05,520
Yes.

720
00:46:05,521 --> 00:46:09,149
Yuseong Apparel is basically
a front for money laundering,

721
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:10,820
exporting knockoff clothes

722
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:13,680
and funneling casino money into Korea.

723
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:17,159
He's a frequent gambler
with a fraud record,

724
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,750
but the place didn't have a
proper setup, let alone server.

725
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,830
He's not our guy.

726
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:30,740
Where's all the cash you
took from this account?

727
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,250
Or where in the Philippines
do they run the website?

728
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:35,730
Tell us that.

729
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,350
I... don't know.

730
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,520
Sure you do. Come on, spill it.

731
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,780
I did what I was told, that's all.

732
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,200
You wanna take the fall for them?

733
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:48,100
They're just using you.

734
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,070
Can't say it.

735
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:52,020
They'll kill me.

736
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:55,860
Hey, ever heard of the "Room of Truth"?

737
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:59,770
If you don't talk now,
he'll kill you first.

738
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,980
I don't want to die really.

739
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:09,940
Then, just tell us who
you're working for.

740
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:16,280
I want my lawyer.

741
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,690
It's a winning lottery
ticket worth $2 million.

742
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:31,390
We bought it, paying an extra 30%,

743
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,770
so that you can keep your hands clean.

744
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:37,779
Please go ahead, take this,

745
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:41,530
and just give our coin the green light.

746
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:43,410
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

747
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:51,100
Don't make me report this.

748
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,890
Fuck, you really don't get it.

749
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,590
This is

750
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:57,930
your last chance.

751
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:08,274
You can't--

752
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,400
I'm not done yet.

753
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,900
Exactly.

754
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,020
We're dumping Ko's body at your site.

755
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:20,330
Man, you shouldn't have killed him.

756
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:21,610
No?

757
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,700
Why not?

758
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:28,270
I mean, it's not that big a deal,

759
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:31,110
<i>I'm just worried for you.</i>

760
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:33,230
And...

761
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:36,650
Choi Yu-seong was arrested.

762
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:39,150
<i>He won't talk, right?</i>

763
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:42,030
<i>I got him the best lawyers,</i>

764
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:44,860
<i>but if he rats to the cops, we're--</i>

765
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,810
That motherfucker...

766
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:57,280
Arriving at three. Get 'em ready.

767
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:02,740
SEO-IL POLICE STATION

768
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:04,910
Mr. Choi.

769
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,500
Your lawyer's coming
at three. Come out.

770
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,310
Delivery.

771
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:30,389
Delivery.

772
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:32,139
- What's this?
- Food delivery.

773
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:33,430
Who's paying?

774
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,850
We didn't order anything.

775
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:36,689
It says Investigation Unit.

776
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:37,730
I don't think...

777
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,610
Where's Investigation?

778
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:46,280
What's going on?

779
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,830
Everybody out, now!

780
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,540
Who ordered it then?

781
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:02,389
Mr. Baek, I said nothing--

782
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:03,390
What the...

783
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:27,650
Shit!

784
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:39,600
For fuck's sake...

785
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:43,060
Chang-gi's become a real handful.

786
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,520
He doesn't know his place.

787
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:50,270
Mr. Kwon,

788
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,819
given what he did
in the police station,

789
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:56,069
he'll end up killing me next.

790
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:57,700
Let's cut him loose.

791
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,370
Ko was handling
Chang-gi's casino funds.

792
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:05,540
Let's make it look like
he was killed for stealing.

793
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:10,500
When the cops close in, we'll
corner him and kill him first.

794
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:11,770
Okay?

795
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,420
Sure.

796
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:15,850
So cold.

797
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,440
What's this smell?

798
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:34,159
Name, Ko Jae-hyuk.

799
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,529
After being fired for insider trading,

800
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:39,289
he's been managing the
finances of the wealthy.

801
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:41,000
The body was found

802
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,750
inside a shipping container
owned by Yuseong Apparel.

803
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:49,150
Just as we figured, this is
tied to the casino as well.

804
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:52,320
Also, the stab wounds on this body

805
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:56,520
resemble those of Cho Sung-jae,
who was killed in the Philippines.

806
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,100
We could be dealing
with the same murderer.

807
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:06,149
Looks like he was advising
multiple firms before he died.

808
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:08,229
According to his friends,

809
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:11,520
he boasted that he'd pull
off something big soon.

810
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,650
Do we have the firms' list?

811
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:16,070
Yes, we'll need to visit
and check each one.

812
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:20,840
<i>A man was found dead in a
container at Incheon Customs.</i>

<i>The man was identified as
a private banker managing...</i>

819
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:45,190
Man, it's got a sweet ass.

820
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,990
Not this fucker again...

821
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,160
What does he want now?

822
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,160
Hey, I can't talk for long.

823
00:53:58,747 --> 00:54:00,201
I saw the news.

824
00:54:00,711 --> 00:54:02,031
<i>Oh, that?</i>

825
00:54:02,206 --> 00:54:04,706
I guess my guys weren't careful.

826
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:06,440
<i>I'll look into it.</i>

827
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,030
<i>You still there?</i>

828
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,150
<i>Look, I'm busy prepping
for the listing ceremony.</i>

829
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,110
Let's talk tomorrow.
I'll meet you wherever.

830
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:19,310
No, I'll visit you.

831
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,330
Fuck, what a creep!

832
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:29,720
- Mr. Kwon.
- Yes.

833
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:31,720
Beef up our security.

834
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,500
Can I get a gun too?

835
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,270
To blow his head off.

836
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:37,850
A gun?

837
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:40,610
I'll see what I can do.

838
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:42,130
Good.

839
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,440

with their assets is QM Holdings</i>

840
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:49,020
<i>and they're having a
listing ceremony tonight.</i>

841
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:53,360
Please cross your arms and shake hands.

842
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:15,340
Everyone, meet our investors.

843
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:18,260
<i>QM Holdings is owned
by Jang Dong-cheol.</i>

844
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:21,720
He's been called the "IT
genius" since he was a kid.

845
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:25,519
He made a fortune developing
various software programs.

846
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,210
Now he's jumping into the crypto scene.

847
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:31,390
We won't know until we shake him down.

848
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,260
Right.

849
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:33,400
What floor?

850
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:34,600
The 20th.

851
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,090
<i>Going up.</i>

852
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:45,880
<i>Lobby.</i>

853
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:54,900
Stay here.

854
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,610
Yes, sir.

855
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:03,350
Come up to the 19th.

856
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,780
Here?

857
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:20,620
Should I go that way?

858
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:40,190
Excuse me.

859
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:43,900
May I see your ID?

860
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,100
Are you a cop?

861
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,610
Seok-do! Hey!

862
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:29,599
What... Hey!

863
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,140
What are you doing?

864
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,270
Let her go okay?

865
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,100
Don't do it.

866
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:36,229
Press down hard.

867
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:37,479
No, wait.

868
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,569
- She'll bleed a lot.
- No, no.

869
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:41,400
No, fuck!

870
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:44,410
You son of a...

871
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:49,730
Man-jae!

872
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,290
Hang in there, okay?

873
00:59:57,810 --> 00:59:59,260
You really won't talk?

874
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:02,660
Trust me, I'm your person to talk to.

875
01:00:04,450 --> 01:00:05,850
You're here.

876
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:09,270
Not much of a talker, huh?

877
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:12,610
I can fix this.

878
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:27,710
Thank you.

879
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,630
Hey, any news from the hospital?

880
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:37,770
Man-jae's fine, and
on his way back now.

881
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:40,260
The lady is recovering too.

882
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,260
Man, I'm pissed.

883
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:47,180
Who are these scumbags?

884
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:51,840
Baek Chang-gi and Cho
Ji-hoon, former ST mercenaries

885
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:55,680
who were expelled for causing
huge civilian casualties.

886
01:00:55,810 --> 01:00:58,900
Their discharge lines up with
the launch of the casino.

887
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:01,019
So they killed Cho Sung-jae,

888
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:03,280
when he refused to cooperate,

889
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:06,690
along with Choi Yu-seong,
their money launderer,

890
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:08,250
fearing he'd talk.

891
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:11,060
It's clear they went to
see Jang that night.

892
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:12,160
That means

893
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,660
Jang's the mastermind
behind the casino.

894
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:17,460
But we don't have any evidence yet.

895
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:20,820
Find out how Jang and
these scumbags are related.

896
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,960
Yes, sir.

897
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:23,350
Seok-do.

898
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:26,560
Deputy wants both of you.

899
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,980
Shit.

900
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:34,530
Tell me one concrete result.

901
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,870
So, the thing is...

902
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:39,529
Cho gets killed,

903
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:43,120
our station raided, a body
turns up in a container!

904
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:46,040
What were you guys doing then?

905
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,040
Is President Jang connected?

906
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:50,630
It's said he's at the
top, stacking cash.

907
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,610
We have no...

908
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,840
We're still looking for evidence.

909
01:01:54,930 --> 01:01:56,030
What about Baek?

910
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:58,720
You sure he didn't flee the country?

911
01:02:00,810 --> 01:02:02,130
Seok-do,

912
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:05,480
it's time to pass this case
to another team, right?

913
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:09,420
You can't do that.
I'll finish this for sure.

914
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:12,180
You had your chance. Get out.

915
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,660
Now!

916
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,689
Come on, you can't
do that. I said I can--

917
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:19,780
Leave!

918
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:22,490
Jeez, you've changed.

919
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:26,120
Ever since your promotion...

920
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:34,120
<i>Let's break up our team
and transfer the case.</i>

921
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:38,250
<i>Things got out of hand.</i>

922
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:44,299
Study hard.

923
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,840
- Thank you.
- Sure.

924
01:02:55,980 --> 01:03:00,140
PLEASE PUNISH THE
MAN WHO KILLED MY SON.

925
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:15,220
What are you doing here all alone?

926
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:18,099
- Why did you come?
- To drive you home.

927
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:19,810
Drink with me.

928
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:22,109
Good evening.

929
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:23,569
Hello, again.

930
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:25,609
- Hello.
- Hi, doing homework?

931
01:03:25,610 --> 01:03:27,150
- Bring the glasses.
- Here.

932
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:28,530
Seok-do,

933
01:03:28,531 --> 01:03:30,410
can't we just keep digging on our own?

934
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:32,450
Stop that talk.

935
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:33,410
Okay.

936
01:03:33,411 --> 01:03:35,780
They're expanding with
more websites now.

937
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:39,040
Even made it easier to sign up.

938
01:03:39,770 --> 01:03:41,419
- What's that?
- There's a fight.

939
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:42,460
- Stop the car.
- Yes, sir.

940
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:46,420
What's wrong with you?

941
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:47,720
Stop it!

942
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:50,510
So many damn thugs in this country...

943
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:53,970
- I said stop!
- Come here, bitch.

944
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:55,220
Hey.

945
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:56,270
What?

946
01:03:57,350 --> 01:03:58,890
Oh, shit.

947
01:03:58,980 --> 01:03:59,980
You alright?

948
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:02,609
We're cops.

949
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:04,190
Don't move, you prick.

950
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:05,560
Stop!

951
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:06,780
What the...

952
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:09,450
Seok-do!

953
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:19,209
Stop, you'll kill him.

954
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:21,420
Stop!

955
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:27,260
How come you three couldn't stop...

956
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:30,600
Guess nobody can.

957
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:47,449
<i>These restaurants all look different</i>

958
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:49,199
<i>but one place runs them.</i>

959
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,000
<i>It's like a monopoly.</i>

960
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:52,620
Hey.

961
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:55,020
He said they're a monopoly?

962
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:56,590
Yes, sir.

963
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:06,180
I wish the police had caught
Chang-gi at the ceremony.

964
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,340
My nerves are killing me.

965
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:12,400
He won't make a move with
the police watching so closely.

966
01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:14,470
No, Mr. Kwon.

967
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:18,310
Fear was never written into his genes.

968
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:21,059
You have his location, so bring him in.

969
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:22,270
Yes, I will.

970
01:05:30,570 --> 01:05:32,170
Fuck.

971
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:42,970
With Chang-gi gone,
who will I play with?

972
01:05:56,380 --> 01:06:00,509
<i>Today at Seo-il Police Station,
Mr. Choi of Yuseong Apparel</i>

973
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:03,559
<i>was murdered while
detained for questioning.</i>

974
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,389
<i>Police are investigating,</i>

975
01:06:05,390 --> 01:06:08,980
<i>and searching for a suspect
caught on a CCTV camera...</i>

976
01:06:11,310 --> 01:06:12,310
Boss,

977
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:14,720
let's go to the Philippines.

978
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,530
I started this to end it.

979
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,740
So I will.

980
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:55,060
Looking for me?

981
01:07:01,170 --> 01:07:03,110
Thought you ran off.

982
01:07:19,850 --> 01:07:21,060
Fuck.

983
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:33,780
You bastard!

984
01:07:51,050 --> 01:07:52,050
You fucking...

985
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:24,370
You son of a...

986
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:10,440
Did Jang promise you the casino?

987
01:09:11,610 --> 01:09:13,270
- Hey.
- Yes?

988
01:09:14,070 --> 01:09:16,070
You know what rich people want?

989
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:19,780
To get even more.

990
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:24,030
But I'm going to share.

991
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:26,870
- What do you say?
- Sure.

992
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:33,500
Why can't you let this one go?

993
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:34,380
Captain,

994
01:09:34,490 --> 01:09:37,000
with digital crime, you
can't chase what you see.

995
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:40,300
Gotta make them move first,
and when do they move?

996
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:42,110
When a rival thrives.

997
01:09:42,290 --> 01:09:44,080
They can't stand that. Why?

998
01:09:44,190 --> 01:09:46,640
Obviously, to take it all themselves.

999
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:48,380
To monopolize.

1000
01:09:48,866 --> 01:09:49,866
So?

1001
01:09:50,076 --> 01:09:51,076
Can I do it?

1002
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:52,680
Do what?

1003
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:53,810
Investigate!

1004
01:09:54,142 --> 01:09:55,142
Seok-do.

1005
01:09:55,288 --> 01:09:56,288
Tae-su.

1006
01:09:56,717 --> 01:09:58,838
I really need to catch these guys.

1007
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:00,599
I'll go talk the the Deputy.

1008
01:10:00,956 --> 01:10:02,575
No, not the Deputy.

1009
01:10:02,678 --> 01:10:04,358
Don't even think about it!

1010
01:10:09,390 --> 01:10:10,520
Excuse me.

1011
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:12,270
What the hell?

1012
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:13,820
Sir.

1013
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:24,269
I'll handle this case.

1014
01:10:24,270 --> 01:10:25,980
Seok-do, get up now.

1015
01:10:26,230 --> 01:10:28,360
How dare you do this in
front of the Commissioner?

1016
01:10:28,610 --> 01:10:31,480
I made a promise to
the victim's mother.

1017
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:33,740
I'll finish this case.

1018
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:35,760
I said no.

1019
01:10:35,870 --> 01:10:36,870
Get up!

1020
01:10:36,970 --> 01:10:38,120
Sir.

1021
01:10:38,830 --> 01:10:42,040
We're about to bust
three digits worth of men.

1022
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:44,360
Three digits?

1023
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,040
That's right!

1024
01:10:46,430 --> 01:10:48,610
I'll get it done, trust me.

1025
01:10:48,730 --> 01:10:49,960
But still--

1026
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,590
Go for three digits.

1027
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,010
Yes, sir.

1028
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:01,519
Bring me the proposal.

1029
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,190
Yes, I'll prepare it.

1030
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,020
I won't let you down!

1031
01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:08,069
It may take a long time,

1032
01:11:08,070 --> 01:11:09,989
to round up criminals.

1033
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:12,950
The law can never be ahead of crime.

1034
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:16,450
Still, if you try hard,
you can catch up.

1035
01:11:16,770 --> 01:11:18,500
I'll take that to heart.

1036
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,160
Thank you.

1037
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:24,500
You've changed.

1038
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:28,960
Detective Ma, right?

1039
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:32,260
Yes. I'm really sorry, sir.

1040
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,100
That's how a detective should be.

1041
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:39,309
This is a big case now. If
things go wrong, I'm dead!

1042
01:11:39,310 --> 01:11:41,149
Okay. Gather 'round!

1043
01:11:41,150 --> 01:11:42,150
Yes, sir.

1044
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:43,440
Listen up.

1045
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,609
We're going to strike Emperor's Casino.

1046
01:11:49,610 --> 01:11:53,480
We gotta seize their main server,
to prove Jang's behind this.

1047
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:55,100
What about Baek?

1048
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:58,600
If we get to the casino site,
he'll rush to meet Jang.

1049
01:11:58,830 --> 01:12:00,749
That's when we'll catch him.

1050
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:02,350
That's all good,

1051
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:04,270
but how do we find where they work?

1052
01:12:04,850 --> 01:12:07,220
We'll build a rival site.

1053
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:10,560
Then they'll come after
us to shut us down.

1054
01:12:11,390 --> 01:12:12,889
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

1055
01:12:12,890 --> 01:12:15,580
Gotta catch them all at
once, or they'll slip away.

1056
01:12:15,730 --> 01:12:16,730
Yes, sir.

1057
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:18,650
Oh, and listen up.

1058
01:12:20,150 --> 01:12:23,320
It may take a long time
to round up criminals.

1059
01:12:24,110 --> 01:12:26,200
Because the law can...

1060
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:28,830
be ahead of crime.

1061
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:30,940
But crime...

1062
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,910
always tries hard.

1063
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,120
Okay?

1064
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:37,310
What are you saying?

1065
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:39,340
You heard it with me earlier.

1066
01:12:40,610 --> 01:12:42,349
We set this up ourselves?

1067
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:43,710
No.

1068
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:45,930
The expert will.

1069
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:58,850
What do you want?

1070
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:02,020
I'll give you the money,
you just set it up.

1071
01:13:02,570 --> 01:13:04,570
You're killing me.

1072
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:10,780
What do I gain from this?

1073
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:13,950
Is that really needed between friends?

1074
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:15,950
Who says we're friends?

1075
01:13:18,830 --> 01:13:23,630
It means even blood brothers must
be exact when it comes to money.

1076
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:25,940
Take this.

1077
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:32,320
I asked my superiors for it,
since I needed an expert like you.

1078
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:35,940
It's a special badge for secret agents.

1079
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:37,199
This is yours.

1080
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:40,370
Gosh, you're playing me again.

1081
01:13:40,530 --> 01:13:44,829
If we have unique tasks,
we hire specialists for them.

1082
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:45,909
You stupid.

1083
01:13:45,910 --> 01:13:47,410
How can I trust you?

1084
01:13:48,430 --> 01:13:49,430
Hey,

1085
01:13:49,810 --> 01:13:51,680
you can't trust a cop?

1086
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,620
Thought you've always
wanted to be a cop.

1087
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:59,109
If things go well, I was also
gonna clear some charges.

1088
01:13:59,110 --> 01:14:00,279
Give it back.

1089
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:01,530
I'll ask another guy.

1090
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:03,070
- Hold on.
- Give it back.

1091
01:14:03,110 --> 01:14:04,800
Mind your driving.

1092
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:07,970
Then, I'll be treated like an officer?

1093
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,579
For sure.

1094
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:11,240
Your rank is corporal!

1095
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:13,330
It's fucking awesome.

1096
01:14:14,810 --> 01:14:16,290
Secret agent...

1097
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:19,000
What's this English mean?

1098
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,629
So, what is it?

1099
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:27,140
It means Police's Dark Army.

1100
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:29,469
Dark Army as in secret agent.

1101
01:14:29,470 --> 01:14:30,640
I see.

1102
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:33,179
Then what's this bird?

1103
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:34,180
An eagle?

1104
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:35,429
A fuzz bird!

1105
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:40,310
Fuck me, so that's why
cops are called fuzz?

1106
01:14:44,190 --> 01:14:45,900
Secret agent?

1107
01:14:48,530 --> 01:14:49,530
I like it.

1108
01:14:49,940 --> 01:14:51,950
- Lets do this.
- Yeah.

1109
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:53,740
Let's roll, Detective!

1110
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:56,830
Let's go.

1111
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:04,170
- Behind you.
- Watch out.

1112
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:05,580
Back it up.

1113
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:18,390
Connect through a VPN
for an overseas IP address.

1114
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:19,850
Yes, ma'am.

1115
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,899
- He killed him here.
- He was? By him?

1116
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:27,569
Report when everything's set.

1117
01:15:27,570 --> 01:15:28,650
Yes, sir.

1118
01:15:29,310 --> 01:15:30,310
Where's Seok-do?

1119
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:33,490
Detective Ma, who will hire the staff?

1120
01:15:34,430 --> 01:15:35,430
You will.

1121
01:15:37,710 --> 01:15:41,879
A team for operation, payout,
charging, an exchange is a must.

1122
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:44,420
We also need a maintenance team.

1123
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:46,710
When the page freezes
when you're losing,

1124
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:48,340
you grow suspicious.

1125
01:15:48,490 --> 01:15:52,260
We need staff on rotating
shifts to run it 24/7.

1126
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,620
Investigations, take over operation.

1127
01:16:05,710 --> 01:16:06,729
Yes, ma'am.

1128
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:08,689
- Cyber team is payout.
- Yes.

1129
01:16:08,690 --> 01:16:11,900
Everything money-related
goes to Intelligence.

1130
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:12,910
Yes, ma'am.

1131
01:16:13,410 --> 01:16:15,240
Forensics will take maintenance.

1132
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:18,079
Now, we're all set.

1133
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,159
Good job.

1134
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,659
When's the flight?

1135
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:22,330
We can go now.

1136
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:23,700
Money's ready, too.

1137
01:16:23,770 --> 01:16:24,880
- Okay.
- What flight?

1138
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:27,090
No need to prepare, just go.

1139
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:28,810
Where? I got work to do.

1140
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:31,399
To the Philippines,
to set up the studio.

1141
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:32,270
Philippines?

1142
01:16:32,271 --> 01:16:34,110
Gotta make it as good as theirs.

1143
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:36,820
I have to supervise here.

1144
01:16:37,150 --> 01:16:38,150
Detective Jang.

1145
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:39,690
We're counting on you.

1146
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:42,159
We might miss the flight. Let's go.

1147
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:43,160
Hey.

1148
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:54,880
Police Dark Army.

1149
01:16:56,710 --> 01:16:58,919
Let's fucking do this!

1150
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:00,170
That's the spirit.

1151
01:17:00,730 --> 01:17:02,599
- Let's go.
- Let's do this!

1152
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:03,899
- Let's roll.
- Yeah.

1153
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,820
- See you guys.
- Take care.

1154
01:17:13,124 --> 01:17:17,336
PHILIPPINES

1155
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:22,160
- It's steaming hot.
- Okay.

1156
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:23,829
Take it off.

1157
01:17:23,830 --> 01:17:26,170
Excuse us. So sorry.

1158
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:28,710
- What, you shit?
- Don't start with him.

1159
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:32,420
What? You ugly-looking dickhead.

1160
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:01,620
Let's go inside.

1161
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:10,050
Hey,

1162
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:11,599
- he got a nice place.
- Right?

1163
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:12,680
Hey, great job.

1164
01:18:12,850 --> 01:18:14,260
It's empty.

1165
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,270
Now we'll set it up.

1166
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:23,070
- Well done.
- Okay.

1167
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:28,780
Hey, what is he saying?

1168
01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:30,230
He wants 30 grand.

1169
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:32,269
That's not what he said at first.

1170
01:18:32,270 --> 01:18:34,649
- He's not making sense.
- Is he ripping us off?

1171
01:18:34,650 --> 01:18:35,650
[Filipino] Get lost.

1172
01:18:35,990 --> 01:18:38,150
The deal is off, so leave now.

1173
01:18:38,850 --> 01:18:40,260
How much did you expect?

1174
01:18:40,570 --> 01:18:42,280
I know it's 15 grand.

1175
01:18:42,430 --> 01:18:43,889
I'm no pushover.

1176
01:18:43,890 --> 01:18:45,140
Get lost!

1177
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:46,900
Why are you siding with Koreans?

1178
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:50,320
We Filipinos should
help each other out.

1179
01:18:50,650 --> 01:18:52,819
If we treat them well this time,

1180
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:55,110
we can rip them off big next time.

1181
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:57,110
Okay, how much then?

1182
01:18:57,370 --> 01:18:58,410
Okay.

1183
01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:01,659
Now, pay him. He won't ask for more.

1184
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:03,910
Good job.

1185
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:05,910
- We good now?
- Buy me some T-shirts.

1186
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,670
- Okay, deal.
- I'll buy you one.

1187
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:15,799
- We're ready outside.
- Yeah?

1188
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:16,760
We're ready.

1189
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:17,820
Okay.

1190
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:20,760
We're all set.

1191
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,640
I asked for the local police's aid.

1192
01:19:23,770 --> 01:19:25,150
So be good with them.

1193
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:26,440
Yes, sir.

1194
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,190
Start now.

1195
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:43,100
It's running well with no lag.

1196
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:49,600
Can't wait to see that arrogant face.

1197
01:19:56,780 --> 01:19:58,240
Where's that motherfucker?

1198
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:02,700
Seriously.

1199
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:06,060
It serves him right,
that son of a bitch.

1200
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:13,770
Mr. Kwon, I didn't know
you were this good.

1201
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:16,059
But you got bruises on your face,

1202
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:17,480
was that Chang-gi?

1203
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:19,979
A hell of a fighter, no?

1204
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:21,479
Where is he?

1205
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:22,480
Over there.

1206
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,190
The piece you asked for.

1207
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:29,700
You really got this?

1208
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:33,220
It's heavy.

1209
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,480
Mr. Kwon.

1210
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:44,930
Thank you for your hard work.

1211
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:53,490
Nerves of steel!

1212
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,660
You've got big balls.

1213
01:20:58,250 --> 01:20:59,870
I'll go kill him.

1214
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,290
Hey, Chang-gi!

1215
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:06,510
Where the hell is he?

1216
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:10,890
Hey, Chang-gi--

1217
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:14,640
Chang-gi?

1218
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:19,980
Those bastards. He's not even tied up.

1219
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:21,520
Oh, no.

1220
01:21:21,730 --> 01:21:23,940
One more step, I'll blow your head off.

1221
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:28,320
What?

1222
01:21:29,490 --> 01:21:31,530
What's the admin key code?

1223
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:38,410
You wanna know that
when you're about to die?

1224
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,710
God, you stupid moron!

1225
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:47,080
It's 159357, you bastard!

1226
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,390
Shit, that son of a bitch.

1227
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,510
Kwon, that fucking asshole.

1228
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:00,660
Shit, back off!

1229
01:22:00,810 --> 01:22:02,020
Back off, you prick!

1230
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:08,570
You fucker!

1231
01:22:08,571 --> 01:22:10,569
What use is the code?

1232
01:22:10,570 --> 01:22:13,530
You can't unlock it
without me, dickhead!

1233
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:16,760
I don't need you.

1234
01:22:20,890 --> 01:22:22,600
I just need this.

1235
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:32,990
Son of a bitch!

1236
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:35,279
Ah, my finger!

1237
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:37,410
Should've kept your promise.

1238
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,290
Chang-gi!

1239
01:22:53,090 --> 01:22:54,760
Fuck.

1240
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:02,680
That prick.

1241
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:11,230
I almost pity you, seeing you go.

1242
01:23:18,110 --> 01:23:19,780
Any last words?

1243
01:23:26,930 --> 01:23:29,300
Fuck you, asshole!

1244
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:43,570
Excuse me.

1245
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:45,530
This here...

1246
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:47,900
What? Say it clearly.

1247
01:23:47,910 --> 01:23:49,320
Take a look.

1248
01:23:51,620 --> 01:23:53,460
What? Where is this?

1249
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:55,560
It's Baguio, Region 2.

1250
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:57,660
Fucking bastards.

1251
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:04,050
Okay. Prepare for a shutdown.

1252
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:07,300
Boss, there's a new
casino studio in town.

1253
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:10,430
Wipe them out.

1254
01:24:11,570 --> 01:24:12,800
Yes, sir.

1255
01:24:14,330 --> 01:24:15,970
I got the key.

1256
01:24:16,350 --> 01:24:17,720
Drive to his villa.

1257
01:24:34,780 --> 01:24:36,240
They started the shutdown.

1258
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:38,079
Prepare for their attack.

1259
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,080
Yes, sir.

1260
01:25:07,150 --> 01:25:08,650
What's with your hair?

1261
01:25:09,610 --> 01:25:10,610
Quiet.

1262
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:31,020
They're here. I see them.

1263
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,190
There's no second chance.

1264
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:34,400
<i>Copy that.</i>

1265
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:00,880
What the hell?

1266
01:26:01,050 --> 01:26:02,220
Where are they?

1267
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:05,915
Grab the server.

1268
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:06,940
Yes, sir.

1269
01:26:13,310 --> 01:26:14,520
What is this?

1270
01:26:14,810 --> 01:26:16,020
I can't see.

1271
01:26:16,730 --> 01:26:17,730
Freeze!

1272
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:19,569
Drop your weapon!

1273
01:26:19,570 --> 01:26:21,280
- Don't move!
- You bastards!

1274
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:23,320
Come here!

1275
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:36,130
Hey, drop it!

1276
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:38,100
I'll kill her.

1277
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:39,140
Drop the knife!

1278
01:26:39,170 --> 01:26:40,170
What are you doing?

1279
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:42,969
- Kill her?
- Relax.

1280
01:26:42,970 --> 01:26:44,259
We heard you.

1281
01:26:44,260 --> 01:26:44,890
Step aside.

1282
01:26:44,891 --> 01:26:47,139
Okay, drop the knife first.

1283
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:48,140
- Easy.
- Help!

1284
01:26:48,141 --> 01:26:49,599
Put it down!

1285
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,770
- Calm down.
- Move aside.

1286
01:26:50,930 --> 01:26:51,640
You'll regret this!

1287
01:26:51,641 --> 01:26:53,390
Put that down and let's talk.

1288
01:26:53,430 --> 01:26:54,640
- Come on.
- Let's kill her.

1289
01:26:54,770 --> 01:26:56,770
I get it, so please stop.

1290
01:26:56,850 --> 01:26:58,849
Let's talk this out.

1291
01:26:58,850 --> 01:27:00,560
What do you want?

1292
01:27:04,270 --> 01:27:05,779
That's it, grab him.

1293
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:06,940
Get him up!

1294
01:27:08,070 --> 01:27:08,900
Hey!

1295
01:27:08,901 --> 01:27:10,990
Where is Emperor's Casino?

1296
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:23,790
Hey, walk faster!

1297
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:25,839
We got the casino's location.

1298
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,250
<i>We're on the move.</i>

1299
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:28,710
Okay.

1300
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:29,550
Move out.

1301
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:30,969
Seok-do, be careful.

1302
01:27:30,970 --> 01:27:31,970
Don't worry, sir.

1303
01:27:47,694 --> 01:27:50,029
USE FINGERPRINT FOR ADMIN APPROVAL

1304
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:51,990
Boss, admin status updated.

1305
01:28:05,330 --> 01:28:07,000
I figured you'd be here.

1306
01:28:10,010 --> 01:28:12,470
I'll just take this. The rest is yours.

1307
01:28:17,310 --> 01:28:18,970
Or should we do this again?

1308
01:28:20,180 --> 01:28:21,479
I'm a busy man.

1309
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:22,980
Let's go our own ways.

1310
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:03,680
Go in, quick!

1311
01:29:03,690 --> 01:29:05,770
Move, move! We're the fuzz.

1312
01:29:07,860 --> 01:29:08,930
Everyone freeze!

1313
01:29:12,230 --> 01:29:14,270
Secure the upper left side.

1314
01:29:23,790 --> 01:29:24,990
Come this way.

1315
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:28,830
Freeze!

1316
01:29:28,870 --> 01:29:31,459
Hands up, knees down!

1317
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:32,540
Come here.

1318
01:29:35,290 --> 01:29:36,590
Help me.

1319
01:29:42,550 --> 01:29:43,550
Please work.

1320
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:44,600
Please...

1321
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:48,350
We need admin approval
to access information here.

1322
01:29:51,230 --> 01:29:52,979
Someone just changed the key

1323
01:29:52,980 --> 01:29:55,690
and backed up the data somewhere else.

1324
01:29:56,030 --> 01:29:57,109
Can you verify the IP?

1325
01:29:57,110 --> 01:29:58,610
Yes, I'll check.

1326
01:30:00,610 --> 01:30:01,160
<i>Found it.</i>

1327
01:30:01,450 --> 01:30:02,570
<i>It's QM Holdings.</i>

1328
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:04,870
That's the backup server's address.

1329
01:30:05,450 --> 01:30:06,910
<i>So it was Jang after all!</i>

1330
01:30:09,580 --> 01:30:10,500
Yes.

1331
01:30:10,501 --> 01:30:12,290
<i>We got evidence against Jang.</i>

1332
01:30:12,330 --> 01:30:16,050
<i>But it looks like Baek is
trying to secure the server.</i>

1333
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:17,550
I got it.

1334
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:19,590
Hey, floor it.

1335
01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:24,389
Don't spill, but hurry up.

1336
01:30:24,390 --> 01:30:25,390
Yes, sir.

1337
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:53,210
You bastards.

1338
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:38,920
Hey!

1339
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:40,340
Where's Jang?

1340
01:31:43,090 --> 01:31:44,470
Baek Chang-gi killed him.

1341
01:31:45,090 --> 01:31:46,470
Where's Baek now?

1342
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:49,600
They went to the airport.

1343
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:51,020
<i>Look for them.</i>

1344
01:31:51,180 --> 01:31:53,340
- Which flight?
- You look it up.

1345
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:08,440
<i>They have fake passports, so
the search turned up blank.</i>

1346
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:11,029
<i>We're trying a different way now.</i>

1347
01:32:11,030 --> 01:32:14,360
We'll use Baek's bio data
to find him on airport CCTVs.

1348
01:32:14,370 --> 01:32:17,490
We gave the airport his forensic data.

1349
01:32:17,830 --> 01:32:20,040
Officers there will start tracking him.

1350
01:32:20,410 --> 01:32:23,830
We need to stop them.
This is our last chance.

1351
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:49,270
You said there are close matches?

1352
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:51,280
Search 'em all if you have to.

1353
01:32:51,490 --> 01:32:52,949
Match rate is too low.

1354
01:32:52,950 --> 01:32:54,780
We're tracking only
50% matches or higher,

1355
01:32:54,950 --> 01:32:56,700
but there are too many.

1356
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:03,000
Thank you, have a nice trip.

1357
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:08,460
Good evening, sir.

1358
01:33:11,130 --> 01:33:12,130
Thank you.

1359
01:33:18,970 --> 01:33:20,060
I found him!

1360
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:23,020
Astar Air KR620 bound for Manila.

1361
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:24,600
Ten minutes till departure.

1362
01:33:24,770 --> 01:33:25,770
Got it.

1363
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:31,819
Good evening.

1364
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:32,820
To your right.

1365
01:33:32,821 --> 01:33:35,320
May I see your boarding pass?

1366
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:37,870
This way, please.

1367
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,919
Yes, this is Chief Ha speaking.

1368
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:37,840
<i>We're connecting the bridge
for an emergency arrest.</i>

1369
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:39,220
Pardon?

1370
01:34:51,620 --> 01:34:53,109
Police. May I enter?

1371
01:34:53,110 --> 01:34:54,360
Yes, this way.

1372
01:35:00,410 --> 01:35:02,279
Are you the police?

1373
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:05,790
Sorry for the trouble.
How much time do I have?

1374
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:07,060
You've got five.

1375
01:35:07,220 --> 01:35:08,620
Easy as pie.

1376
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:15,160
This is the police.

1377
01:35:15,430 --> 01:35:18,559
Everyone, please step outside.

1378
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:20,479
We ask for your cooperation.

1379
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:22,480
Evacuate this way.

1380
01:35:30,490 --> 01:35:31,860
You two.

1381
01:35:32,570 --> 01:35:33,870
Stay still!

1382
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:40,000
Flying comfy in first
class after killing people?

1383
01:35:42,590 --> 01:35:44,080
You again.

1384
01:35:44,370 --> 01:35:46,710
I made someone a promise.

1385
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:48,510
To punish you.

1386
01:35:50,490 --> 01:35:52,760
Will you be okay on your own?

1387
01:35:53,490 --> 01:35:55,100
You prick.

1388
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:58,520
It's so lonely.

1389
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:06,890
Let's leave.

1390
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:10,046
After finishing him off.

1391
01:36:11,805 --> 01:36:12,805
Can't leave.

1392
01:36:14,020 --> 01:36:15,020
Hey.

1393
01:36:15,075 --> 01:36:16,251
I'm a cop.

1394
01:36:16,955 --> 01:36:19,444
So I don't hit people
with all my strength.

1395
01:36:21,110 --> 01:36:23,070
But you're an exception.

1396
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:27,200
I'll do as I like. Okay?

1397
01:36:40,530 --> 01:36:42,275
Missing your knife?

1398
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:10,240
You bastard.

1399
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:11,450
Crazy fool.

1400
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:14,710
You dumbass cop.

1401
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:50,600
Just stay down.

1402
01:37:57,790 --> 01:37:58,880
You son of a--

1403
01:38:22,810 --> 01:38:24,520
Gonna spread jam on me?

1404
01:38:33,530 --> 01:38:34,530
I will.

1405
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,080
Having fun?

1406
01:39:51,770 --> 01:39:52,650
Move forward.

1407
01:39:52,690 --> 01:39:54,820
Eyes on the floor.

1408
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:56,670
Shit.

1409
01:39:56,740 --> 01:39:59,210
You cops really risk your lives.

1410
01:39:59,310 --> 01:40:01,440
A big round of applause.

1411
01:40:01,690 --> 01:40:04,109
Hey, I saw you dodge like this,

1412
01:40:04,110 --> 01:40:05,479
- and bam!
- It's nothing.

1413
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:06,480
It was amazing.

1414
01:40:06,610 --> 01:40:08,610
- Our shadow agent.
- Wow.

1415
01:40:19,860 --> 01:40:21,000
Are you alright?

1416
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:26,670
Hey, Seok-do!

1417
01:40:26,860 --> 01:40:28,460
Good work.

1418
01:40:28,550 --> 01:40:30,800
- You okay?
- Good job.

1419
01:40:30,980 --> 01:40:32,110
What's this?

1420
01:40:32,230 --> 01:40:35,689
Go get this treated.
I'll take care of the rest.

1421
01:40:35,690 --> 01:40:37,819
Who's in charge here?

1422
01:40:37,820 --> 01:40:39,400
That'd be me.

1423
01:40:39,410 --> 01:40:41,779
Captain of Metro Investigations.

1424
01:40:41,780 --> 01:40:45,369
Our first class cabin's
been seriously damaged.

1425
01:40:45,370 --> 01:40:48,040
Please come inside with me.

1426
01:40:49,370 --> 01:40:51,749
Seok-do, did you break something?

1427
01:40:51,750 --> 01:40:52,920
Follow me.

1428
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:57,300
- I just got here.
- You'll see.

1429
01:40:57,800 --> 01:40:59,630
They're coming out.

1430
01:41:00,510 --> 01:41:03,010
Captain, did you plan this operation?

1431
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:05,350
Yes, I did.

1432
01:41:05,810 --> 01:41:08,679
Detective Ma, I heard
you led this case.

1433
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:10,309
A word, please.

1434
01:41:10,310 --> 01:41:12,350
Anything you want to say?

1435
01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:14,310
- Hurry up.
- One by one.

1436
01:41:15,610 --> 01:41:17,649
As intellectual crime evolves,

1437
01:41:17,650 --> 01:41:20,740
the police remain dedicated
to protecting citizens.

1438
01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:34,680
Ma'am,

1439
01:41:34,690 --> 01:41:36,600
I kept my promise.

1440
01:41:58,920 --> 01:41:59,830
Pull over.

1441
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:02,000
Why's the traffic light so short?

1442
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:04,840
What is it?

1443
01:42:05,450 --> 01:42:08,590
Honey, they're cops! We're so fucked.

1444
01:42:08,890 --> 01:42:10,220
Don't worry.

1445
01:42:10,970 --> 01:42:12,639
You know who I am?

1446
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:14,350
<i>...run the plate number.</i>

1447
01:42:17,350 --> 01:42:18,230
Good afternoon.

1448
01:42:18,270 --> 01:42:20,479
You ran a red light. License, please.

1449
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:22,480
Good work, sir.

1450
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,780
I'm one of you.

1451
01:42:31,810 --> 01:42:32,849
Step out.

1452
01:42:32,850 --> 01:42:35,350
You're under arrest for
impersonating an officer.

1453
01:42:35,610 --> 01:42:37,190
I am an officer.

1454
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:39,879
FDA! Police Dark Army!

1455
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:42,479
That's the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration.

1456
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:45,250
Police starts with a P, not F. Get out!

1457
01:42:45,530 --> 01:42:46,619
Officer Kim!

1458
01:42:46,620 --> 01:42:47,660
Get out now.

1459
01:42:47,940 --> 01:42:50,740
- Out of the car.
- Honey!

1460
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:53,210
Let go of me.

1461
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:04,319
Hey, shadow agent. What's up?

1462
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:06,610
<i>You son of a bitch, you played me!</i>

1463
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:09,950
<i>Police starts with P, not F!</i>

1464
01:43:15,140 --> 01:43:17,430
<i>In 2018, the police cracked
down on digital crime,</i>

1465
01:43:17,470 --> 01:43:20,030
<i>raiding an online gambling ring
and arresting over a hundred men,</i>

1466
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:26,010
THE ROUNDUP 4: PUNISHMENT
