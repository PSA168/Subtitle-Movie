1
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,830
-=When I was a child, I traveled here from the future.=-

2
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:06,840
-=Long long time ago, aliens imprisoned their prisoners inside human beings=-

3
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:14,810
-=My father and Thunder were responsible for regulating these prisoners.=-

4
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:24,740
-=One day, Designer, leader of the prisoners escaped from the prison.=-

5
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,210
-=The whole city was full of the alien gas called 'Haba'.=-

6
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,210
-=People began to die one by one.=-

7
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,340
-=Those alien prisoners inside human beings began to wake up.=-

8
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,060
-=Designer wants to=-

9
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,810
-=release the rest Haba to change the earth atmosphere=-

10
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,820
-=so that all the human beings would die=-

11
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,990
-=and the earth would belong to them.=-

12
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,660
-=48 minutes to go before the outbreak of Haba.=-

13
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,580
Go to the next period.

14
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,830
-=We had to lock them in the past and return=-

15
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,830
-=to prevent the outbreak.=-

16
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,670
What's that?

17
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,610
Dad!

18
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,610
Lee Ahn, you need to find me

19
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,760
and prevent the outbreak of Haba.

20
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:52,360
-=During this time, Guard was damaged and Thunder stopped working.=-

21
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:59,200
-=To go back to the future, I need the Divine Sword.=-

22
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,380
-=10 years later, the Divine Sword appeared.=-

23
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,380
You're so beautiful.

24
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,860
But have we met before?

25
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,780
This cunning girl is shooting thunder!

26
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,980
-=People all came for the Sword.=-

27
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,940
-=A strange monk.=-

28
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,990
-=Two immortals from the Samgak Mountain.=-

29
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,950
-=And alien prisoners.=-

30
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:37,930
Besides...

31
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,660
-=I finally got the Sword.=-

32
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,790
Right King and Left King, go after her!

33
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,010
That inside your body...

34
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,390
What's inside me?

35
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,210
The girl that shoots thunder disappeared with the Sword.

36
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,280
What should we do now?

37
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,860
Find the Divine Sword of course.

38
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,880
We'll go after that girl.

39
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,470
-=Now, I'm on my way to find the ship and Thunder.=-

40
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,720
-=I'll go back to the future=-

41
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,480
-=and prevent the outbreak of Haba.=-

42
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:54,110
-=Alienoid S02=-

43
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,230
One soup rice for here

44
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,660
and one dried fish to go.

45
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,230
Okay.

46
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,280
Long time no see.

47
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,660
How far has rumors about me gone?

48
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,260
The thunder-shooting girl is heading to the Byongnan Garden House.

49
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,560
Anyone who kills her or gets the Divine Sword

50
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,030
shall get a large amount of bounty.

51
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,230
How come you wear a beard?

52
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,680
It belongs to a man I know.

53
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,910
Very natural right?

54
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,880
Natural indeed.

55
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,110
It takes four days to walk to Byongnan Garden House.

56
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,930
There is no hotel on the way for rest.

57
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,680
How many days have you gone without sleep?

58
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,160
Just two days.

59
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,630
Sleep doesn't matter.

60
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,110
What about the thing I asked you to find?

61
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,260
I'm definitely the right person for the task!

62
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,180
I searched the whole area along the river

63
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,030
where the fishman found the Divine Sword.

64
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,680
And finally I found someone

65
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,430
who once saw this thing.

66
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,430
You said that it's about this big, right?

67
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,030
Thunder, long time no see.

68
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,580
That means it's alive right?

69
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,230
Alive? You said it's a machine, didn't you?

70
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,780
It's a cute and wonderful being.

71
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,480
Who saw it?

72
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,310
Two woodcutters from the village beside Hwangneung Mountain.

73
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,660
They're brothers.

74
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,360
But the problem is...

75
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,860
Watch out for those two.

76
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,030
Let's go.

77
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,160
Where shall we meet after I find it?

78
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,310
The valley near Byongnan Garden House.

79
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,810
The one full of bird calls.

80
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,810
Okay, full of bird calls.

81
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,130
We are the legendary wizards of Sobaek Mountain.

82
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,280
You...

83
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,060
You're the thunder-shooting girl!

84
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,810
She wears a beard on such a pretty face!

85
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,730
She won't look pretty soon.

86
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,730
Because we'll press her face against the ground and ruin it.

87
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,560
What? What do you wanna do with the axe?

88
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:00,630
I'm thinking

89
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,630
whether I should chop your months or curb the urge.

90
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,830
But it's human nature to brag and be hypocritical.

91
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,080
I'll just curb the urge.

92
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,760
Our lives are very precious. I think you may as well

93
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,380
go before I cut your necks.

94
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,060
Do you really think that shabby axe can hit us?

95
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,260
Such a little trick!

96
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,560
How dare you!

97
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,730
I'll cut you into pieces!

98
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,510
Ouch!

99
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,080
Don't go after me.

100
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,580
Alright!

101
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,810
Next time you meet me,

102
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,610
watch out for the thunder!

103
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,510
Okay!

104
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,310
These two cats followed me here.

105
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,530
Don't follow me anymore.

106
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,360
That night 10 years ago,

107
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,560
we found him unconscious in the bush and brought him back.

108
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,730
What did the Hyungam say?

109
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,260
There was something terrible inside him.

110
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,330
So I suggested killing him

111
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,310
but you stopped me.

112
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,210
As long as he could resist the force, it's okay.

113
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,460
He gave him the fan with two swords.

114
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,680
Do you remember?

115
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,480
That day in Hyungam's room...

116
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,730
What on earth did he encounter near the river?

117
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,910
There is a terrible being inside his body.

118
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,730
That's why I suggested killing him.

119
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,810
Or he might cause a bigger turmoil after growing up.

120
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,660
Dear, it'll be fine as long as we don't teach him the magic arts.

121
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,130
The kid has the right to choose his own life.

122
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,530
I'll leave this fan to him.

123
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,910
There are two very heavy swords in it.

124
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,330
They'll suppress the force inside him.

125
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,530
What if he pulls the swords out?

126
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,530
These two swords can subdue demons and monsters, can't they?

127
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,310
No one can pull them out expect us.

128
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,560
Even if he pulls them out, we can kill him then.

129
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,080
But he pulled them out and learned magic arts.

130
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,210
So shall we kill him?

131
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,610
Is he really the student of the Hyungam?

132
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,610
No way. He looks just like a thief.

133
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,930
Let me touch him and we'll know.

134
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,960
What's this place?

135
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,280
Don't you remember?

136
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,710
You pulled the sword from the fan and killed the monster.

137
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,960
Ja-jang! Ja-jang!

138
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:08,480
Ja-jang!

139
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,480
Where is Ja-jang?

140
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,410
Who are you asking?

141
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,280
That old lady is both deaf and dumb.

142
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,610
Excuse me.

143
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,910
Ma'am, I have a question.

144
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,030
Where is Ja-jang from?

145
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,710
Write it down?

146
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,410
10 years ago.

147
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,930
Hwangneung Mountain.

148
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,280
Go and check if he's alive.

149
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,030
Okay.

150
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,280
What's this place?

151
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,980
Here is Milbon.

152
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,380
An isolated place where people learn the Way.

153
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,380
I got lost.

154
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,460
I was locked in time.

155
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,560
Everyone is locked in time.

156
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,180
I don't know what happened to you.

157
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,510
Will you wear this?

158
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,680
This mask is called Ja-jang.

159
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,880
Such an interesting human.

160
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,180
Monster!

161
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,430
My eyes!

162
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:44,960
My eyes!

163
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,730
From now on...

164
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,830
I'll run this place.

165
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,180
Why does Ja-jang want to find the Divine Sword?

166
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,060
Time.

167
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,360
I'm locked in time.

168
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,880
Where on earth is Designer?

169
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,930
When Designer entered other human's body,

170
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,590
there were four human beings present.

171
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,680
-=Hyungam Cheongwoon Heukseol Gaedong=-
there were four human beings present.

172
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,610
-=Hyungam Cheongwoon Heukseol Gaedong=-

173
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:18,720
They can control the energy.
-=Hyungam Cheongwoon Heukseol Gaedong=-

174
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,890
They can control the energy.

175
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,710
So you must find Designer and go back.

176
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,710
Why do you have to dwell in that sick body?

177
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,960
Why not get into other healthy body?

178
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,080
That way, I'll lose my memory.

179
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,030
Designer hid inside a human body.

180
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,260
How could he get out?

181
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,710
Use the Divine Sword to stab the rest 3 people.

182
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,860
Stab using the Divine Sword and Designer appears.

183
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,430
Old lady.

184
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,080
You mean Ja-jang killed the Hyungam

185
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,860
and poisoned us to keep us here?

186
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:11,280
The Hyungam's student was also on Hwangneung Mountain

187
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,760
but it seemed that Ja-jang didn't know that.

188
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,680
Let's kill the student first.

189
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,360
Where is he?

190
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,230
Let's kill him before the monsters appear.

191
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,210
Let's go after him.

192
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,330
He can't be far from here.

193
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,860
Come and see.

194
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,110
Guess what this is?

195
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,460
Mix the ginseng from September Mountain with calculus bovis and herbs,

196
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,830
and you'll get this magic medicine that makes you live a young life forever.

197
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,480
It's called Cheongmyeong Pill!

198
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,630
Though this guy is blind now,

199
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,930
he couldn't even walk 3 years ago.

200
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,930
He is the legendary Neung-pa.

201
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,930
Let's see his swordsmanship first.

202
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:19,460
That was a close shave!

203
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,760
-Now everyone, you can... -Wait!

204
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,530
I can't sense

205
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:31,180
the aura from your sword.

206
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,110
Then how about showing us your swordsmanship.

207
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,960
Since you wanna see,

208
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,310
let me show you the sword with a history of 200 years.

209
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,210
You must have sensed its mightiness.

210
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,760
Since I've pulled it out,

211
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,510
one of us will have to die.

212
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,910
This is the best sword from the palace.

213
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,110
It's made by the two immortals of Samgak Mountain.

214
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,660
We're here to greet you with respect.

215
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,160
Do you still remember us?

216
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,160
Such rough sound. You must have had a tough life.

217
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,160
Sir, please sell this sword to us.

218
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,910
You must have bought it from the immortals of Samgak Mountain.

219
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,630
Even if I sell it to you, it won't make any difference.

220
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,130
My swordsmanship is good today.

221
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,860
Have you sold any pills?

222
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,860
Would people buy pills because of your swordsmanship?

223
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,680
They bought it because I was so eloquent.

224
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,010
How was my performance today?

225
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,010
Excellent, right?

226
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:31,930
It's getting more and more...

227
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,730
Who are they?

228
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,730
Our new members?

229
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:35,210
What happened?

230
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,230
What's this?

231
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,380
There is no such thing as a free lunch.

232
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,730
To get the Divine Sword
from the thunder-shooting girl,

233
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,880
we need that sword.

234
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,080
We need to find it faster than Milbon.

235
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,680
Milbon is looking for the Divine Sword?

236
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,610
Ja-jang?

237
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,080
My eyes.

238
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,580
My eyes.

239
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,660
It's said that the Divine Sword
can cure any diseases.

240
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,480
I wonder if it can cure my eyes.

241
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,960
It seems that the thunder-shooting
girl is in danger now.

242
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,660
We can help you.

243
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:10,230
So some cats were playing here,

244
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,060
climbing up along this pole?

245
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,080
The cats were nothing.

246
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,480
That thunder-shooting girl
made a mess here yesterday

247
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,560
which prevented me from doing business.

248
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,010
It seems that she's a tough lady.

249
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,160
They might follow her this way.

250
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,910
I want a bowl of soup rice

251
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,260
and rice wine.

252
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:27,830
Okay.

253
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,730
I have to find the Divine Sword

254
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,180
so that I can know what's inside me.

255
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,610
Where is Mureuk?

256
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,280
I think he's around here.

257
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,310
There! He's there.

258
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,880
Look at the way he eats.

259
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,580
There is a monster inside him.
So he eats so much.

260
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,610
Let's go and get him!

261
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,630
Let's make sure there is indeed a
monster inside him and then kill him.

262
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,280
We can tell him that we want him as
our student and try to find the clues.

263
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,730
Then I know what to do.

264
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,260
Let's say he's your student,

265
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,260
not mine.

266
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,580
Two bowls of soup rice, please.

267
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,280
Ah!

268
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,430
Such a coincidence!

269
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,160
We met again.

270
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,660
There is no such thing as coincidence.
It's all about fate.

271
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,580
Let us introduce ourselves.

272
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,460
We are the two immortals from Samgak Mountain.

273
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,610
We live in the mountain,
so we know little about the world.

274
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,180
Let me grab your arm first.

275
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,180
What's your name?

276
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:36,830
Mureuk.

277
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,310
Mureuk.

278
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,260
How do you feel?

279
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:49,810
Very soft.

280
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,930
No, no. Not soft. Shy.

281
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,110
No, no, no. Not shy!

282
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,980
I'm 150 years old. I don't feel shy.

283
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,810
The fan becomes bigger when I
open it and smaller when I fold it.

284
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,310
But this doesn't matter.

285
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:05,960
What?

286
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,430
Such an idiot! I have to show it to you, right?

287
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,310
We made this fan.

288
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,760
We put some weapons inside it.

289
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,980
We also put the wind from the north.

290
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,010
What's this? A cat?

291
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:16,780
I don't remember drawing it.

292
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,810
I drew it.

293
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,310
Don't fan it.

294
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,780
Or the cats will become human beings.

295
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,510
What happened?

296
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,360
Who are you?

297
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,410
They are here. Wait! Wait!

298
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,030
Who are you?

299
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,530
Get inside. Get inside!

300
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:39,630
They've been after you since yesterday.

301
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,260
Where are you leading me to?

302
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:44,780
Follow me!

303
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,830
Don't stop there. Hurry and come up.

304
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,330
Who are you guys?

305
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,830
He's Right King and I'm Left King.

306
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,010
We're human beings.

307
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,260
Human?

308
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,610
And we're cats at the same time.

309
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,310
Cats?

310
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:14,960
Where are the cats?

311
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,110
They are after that girl.

312
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,410
And I'm chasing the cats.

313
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,330
I'm kinda busy. Gotta go.

314
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,160
But

315
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,060
your acupoint is blocked here.

316
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,760
That means there is something inside your body.

317
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,530
So the monster is inside you indeed.

318
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,860
I can't do this.

319
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,180
He's taking my power.

320
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,010
Out of my way! Why can't I control myself?

321
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,860
What's happening?

322
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,130
Everyone hide!

323
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,360
You should stop it! Not let it through!

324
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,840
Someone come and stop me!

325
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,130
That! That! That!

326
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,010
Ahahahahahahah!

327
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:09,930
Where?

328
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,720
Ouch ouch ouch!

329
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,390
Finally, it stopped.

330
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,940
Mureuk will go nowhere.

331
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,620
Go on.

332
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:40,780
Mureuk.

333
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,300
Follow me.

334
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,100
Hocus pocus. Hocus pocus.

335
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,360
Hocus pocus.

336
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:06,610
Hocus pocus. Hocus pocus.

337
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,200
Hocus pocus. Hocus pocus.

338
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,190
Hocus pocus.

339
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,530
Let me tell you one thing.

340
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,550
Your teacher abandoned you.

341
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,130
Why?

342
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:25,210
Because he knows there
was a monster inside you.

343
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,750
Wait for me. Wait for me.

344
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,310
Why are you following me?

345
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,150
Our master told us to.

346
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:42,760
Master?

347
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,400
Oh my gosh!

348
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,390
Don't you know our master?

349
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,830
Aren't you two married?
What happened to you?

350
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,100
He'll come to us soon.

351
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,980
Wait. Is he coming here soon?

352
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,730
Yeah.

353
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,310
Then tell him. I'll meet him
when the weather is fine.

354
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,110
No, you're his wife.

355
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,660
What wife? That's nonsense.

356
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,690
You got married and spent
the wedding night together. You're his wife!

357
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:00,950
What wedding night?

358
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,660
Oh my!

359
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,910
Why would I say that?

360
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,410
See? Things didn't work out
on the wedding night.

361
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,490
Then have that night again
when you have a clear mind.

362
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:09,840
What are you!

363
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,770
Right King? You're not a human but a cat.

364
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:12,930
You live in the fan of that man, right?

365
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:13,590
Yeah.

366
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,920
I think you look familiar.

367
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,730
What are you talking about?

368
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,390
What are you up to?
It's my first time meeting you.

369
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,090
That broke our hearts. We're cats.

370
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,390
-Yeah. -Yeah.

371
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,720
Goodbye.

372
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,860
Tell that guy. I appreciate it.

373
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,900
I'll treat our encounter as a good memory.

374
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,270
Bye, kittens.

375
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:33,900
Don't follow me.

376
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,490
Don't speak like that,
my dear sister-in-law!

377
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,840
I'm not his wife!

378
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,480
This is not good!
We're heading that way too.

379
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,170
Let's hope she won't get angry.

380
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:42,550
We're just doing what we should do.

381
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,210
But when will he come?

382
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:45,740
Let's kill him

383
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,200
and see if the monster will come out.

384
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm against using violence.

385
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,420
I'm against it too!

386
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,000
Why would you change your mind?

387
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,510
There must be something.

388
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:01,390
One flagon of wine, please.

389
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,810
Two flagons.

390
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,930
I can't do this when I'm not drunk.

391
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,850
Let's drink first.

392
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,310
Hey, here.

393
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,190
Wait.

394
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,240
Give me the knife.

395
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,650
That knife.

396
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,240
What's this?

397
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,410
Are these dishes for that room?

398
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,120
Yeah.

399
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,200
Give them in the room.

400
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,350
But he said that no one was allowed in.

401
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,170
It's okay. It's getting friendly inside.

402
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:14,050
What's that?

403
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:14,750
What?

404
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,670
That?

405
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,710
Ouch! An arrow. Where is it from?

406
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,800
Ouch!

407
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,270
That's too much!

408
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,060
Don't let anyone in.

409
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,900
Okay.

410
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:53,300
That gun is useless.

411
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:54,850
What about this one?

412
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:29,930
That way.

413
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,170
Who are you?

414
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,920
Are you from Milbon?

415
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,960
The sound of arrow is familiar.

416
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,260
Is Ja-jang here too?

417
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:09,970
Neung-pa?

418
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,300
The guy that was driven out?

419
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,750
He is indeed Neung-pa!

420
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,490
Hush.

421
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,430
The Divine Sword

422
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,440
can cure diseases, right?

423
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:06,860
Who are you?

424
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:10,060
Is this part golden?

425
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:13,490
And this part is supposed to be green,
glittering with clear light.

426
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,320
Aren't you blind?

427
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:16,910
Who are you?

428
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,200
I saw it before.

429
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:24,000
A man wearing strange armor

430
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,210
disappeared with it in the light.

431
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,260
You saw that scene?

432
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,010
Who are you?

433
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,680
Why do you have it with you?

434
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:49,400
It belongs to her! She saw people with it.

435
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:50,440
Who's that!

436
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,040
I'm her husband!

437
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,640
Thunder-shooting girl!

438
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,320
Where is she?

439
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,620
Look at you.

440
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,580
Are you stealing my magic arts?

441
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:45,710
It's not stealing. I'm just learning.

442
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,250
Thunder-shooting girl! Come out!

443
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:00,140
My dear, don't mind me. Just go!

444
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,130
Hurry.

445
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,390
Is she gone?

446
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,100
Really?

447
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,060
Who's gone?

448
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,110
Doesn't thing sheet belong to the two immortals?

449
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,020
I took it in secret.

450
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,440
They disappeared behind the sheet!

451
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,910
Why do you have the sheet that
belongs to the two immortals?

452
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,380
Just in front of me.

453
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,220
Why are you always dropping things?

454
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,920
It's you who pushed me.

455
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,240
Don't mind us. We're just passing by.

456
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:41,890
Quiet!

457
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:42,930
Quiet! Quiet!

458
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,230
You're waking the whole village up!

459
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,600
Please go on, sorry.

460
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,280
Did you commit any crimes?

461
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,350
Why would you ask something like that so loudly?

462
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,980
Your eyes are poisonous.

463
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,480
What poisonous?

464
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,700
I need to find the Divine Sword.

465
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,700
I want to open my eyes.

466
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:17,720
-=The year 2022, Seoul=-

467
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:48,000
Why is my ancestor staring at me today?
I can't even drink the tea.

468
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,710
Don't worry.

469
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,830
Nothing for you to worry about.

470
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,880
Nothing happens yet.

471
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,630
I'm okay anyway.

472
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,260
The world is in peace.

473
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:07,180
Even if I wanna use the thing inside the golf bag,

474
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,560
there is nowhere for me to use it.

475
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,890
See you tomorrow, sir.

476
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:23,470
-=2 days before the outbreak of Haba=-

477
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,450
Hey, get him!

478
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,290
Get him!

479
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,110
Who are you?

480
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:04,900
Me?

481
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,620
A passer-by who's just finished
exercise and is heading home.

482
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,170
Where are you going, thief?

483
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:12,910
What the hell?

484
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,210
You hit me first.

485
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,070
How did you catch him?

486
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,570
I was just passing by and
saw you guys working hard.

487
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,030
Which unit do you belong to?

488
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,320
Me?

489
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,700
That one.

490
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,450
That crossroads.

491
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,670
Give me your phone.

492
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,540
Crossroads?

493
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,120
Crossroads? North department?

494
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,460
North department crossroads?

495
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,040
Customs Service crossroads.

496
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,880
Ah.

497
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,920
I'm the inspector in charge of smuggling.

498
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,900
Call me if you need a witness.

499
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,590
Okay.

500
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,550
Is he a smuggler?

501
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,520
You can tell that by the shape?

502
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,560
They make them round to
put them inside the body.

503
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,310
Ah.

504
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,930
So I need your contact information now.

505
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:19,860
What's your name?

506
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,990
Don't ask me name. You should send
the document to the police station.

507
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:23,520
Sheriff Kang Chun-seok.

508
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,150
Yeah.

509
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,740
I'll call you. Do pick up the phone please.

510
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,360
Okay.

511
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,330
-=Jisan Hospital=-

512
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:35,370
What?

513
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:38,330
What's this place?

514
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,010
It's Jisan Hospital here.

515
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:41,710
We shall not talk unless
it's for the sake of diagnosis.

516
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,720
Do you feel pain when I press here?

517
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:44,970
What are you doing?

518
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:46,100
Is my neck broken?

519
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,550
Tell me the truth, will I become crippled?

520
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,300
It's not broken. You're lucky.

521
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,090
I could stay here longer if it was broken.

522
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:53,060
When will you send me to the police station?

523
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,060
Goo Sam-sik.

524
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,170
Haven't I told you not to speak?

525
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,480
-=Seo Yeon-ging=-

526
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,290
The could looks beautiful.

527
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:24,090
-=1 day before the outbreak of Haba=-

528
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,310
The prisoner Ho Seong-cheon has arrived.

529
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,000
What's this?

530
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,720
Damn!

531
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,800
Damn! Go away!

532
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,380
What?

533
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,340
What?

534
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,720
His name is Goo Sam-sik.
He's been in prison for 9 times.

535
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,470
I'll go to the hospital first.

536
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,020
Gotta go.

537
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,570
Hey, Mr Kang Chun-seok.

538
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,910
You don't have to welcome me here.

539
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:07,400
You can only visit him.
Don't ask any questions.

540
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,530
What?

541
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,070
I know that kid.

542
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,080
Let's go and visit the patient.

543
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,200
Wait. Why's the door open?

544
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,670
-We came through the front door right? -Yeah.

545
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:25,970
Go to the back door and parking lot. Hurry!

546
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:37,010
Why isn't Lee Ahn here?

547
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:40,680
What did you say?

548
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,260
She overheard our conversation.

549
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,390
Track Lee Ahn down.

550
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,440
She filmed what happened here with her phone.

551
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,810
She went to her friend's place.

552
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,810
What's her friend called?

553
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,450
She has only one friend,

554
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:57,290
born on 17th July 2011.

555
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:58,240
I'm still searching for the address.

556
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,700
The name is Kim Min-seon.

557
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,620
Kim Min-seon?

558
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,160
My niece?

559
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,840
Oh my god! Did you really film this?

560
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,180
Is this your father?

561
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,760
You filmed this yourself?

562
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,060
Hush!

563
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,220
Aunt?

564
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,390
Yeah.

565
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,770
Lee Ahn's here.

566
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,160
Yeahn aunt. She'll sleep here.

567
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:30,810
She ran away from home.

568
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,780
Good day.

569
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,900
Yeah, I'm very good.

570
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,490
If you ran away from home, your father...

571
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:39,320
But your father's car.

572
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,920
Is it really like that

573
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,580
which is made by NASA and can speak?

574
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:47,450
I heard your father talk to the car.

575
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,580
Ah, but how could a car talk?

576
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,290
Right.

577
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:53,890
Yeah.

578
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,210
Why would you come to my room?

579
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,130
What?

580
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,640
Yeah, have a rest then.

581
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,590
Cultivate your friendship.

582
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,670
So cute.

583
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,670
What's this?

584
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,680
Sam-sik?

585
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:03,870
-=The day of the outbreak=-

586
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,380
The red spot is the motorbike that
was stolen from the hospital by Sam-sik.

587
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:19,010
These motorbikes for takeaway
are equipped with GPG now.

588
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,630
It's only 3 kilometers away.

589
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,210
What's that?

590
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,480
It seems to be some accident.

591
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,360
Good.

592
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,920
These medicines are of high quality.

593
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,230
What's happening?

594
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,110
What's wrong with these cars?

595
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,330
What's happening?

596
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:08,430
It doesn't seem to be a common accident.

597
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,780
Run!

598
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,160
What's that?

599
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,180
Sam-sik is there.

600
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:01,210
We still don't know where this

601
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:04,510
red gas come from and what it's made of.

602
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:08,210
The contaminated area has stopped expanding now.

603
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:10,330
The police is forming a cordon.

604
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,460
You're now watching the two

605
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:11,930
survivors in the contaminated area taken by the drone.

606

608
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:17,930

609
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:21,020
survive in an area where countless people died?

survive in an area where countless people died?

611
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,210
This is still a mystery.

612
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,110
I saw that man in the video

613
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,330
taken by Lee Ahn.

614
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:28,070

Stay here, Min-seon.

622
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,480
I'll be back soon.

623
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,010
Now is the moment

624
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:47,430
my ancestor talked about.

625
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:54,760
Who are you?

626
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,410
I work for the government too.

627
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:59,030
Hi there.

628
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,280
Play the video please.

629
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:05,360
Who's in charge here?

630
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,410
Who are you?

631
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:09,130
Please watch this video first.

632
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,680
This is Jisan Hospital.

633
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,180
This person is the first survivor
in the contaminated area.

634
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,130
The second survivor.

635
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,910
They were both in Jisan Hospital.

636
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:23,330
This is not a coincidence.

637
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:24,480
There is one more person.

638
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,910
Sam-sik was in Jisan Hospital too.

639
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,360
He might be the third survivor.

640
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,260
Who's Sam-sik?

641
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,230
He's the smuggler we're following.

642
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:33,760
He's in the contaminated area now.

643
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:35,060
Who are you guys then?

644
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:37,680
I'm Min Gae-in, inspector of the Customs Service.

645
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:40,580
What's more important is who took the video.

646
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:43,180
My niece has a friend named Lee Ahn.

647
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,580
Her father is a little bit strange...

648
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:47,160
Alright, alright.

649
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:49,530
Customs Service right?

650
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:53,410
Do you know how many people is
claiming that they took videos of them?

651
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:54,860
All of these are fake.

652
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:57,010
Don't you know how to manage the scene?

653
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,960
Give me a minute please.

654
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:03,290
Hello?

655
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:03,380

Hi, hello!

660
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,410
Can Lee Ahn stay at your place for several days?

661
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:15,530
Yeah, Min-seon would be happy about that.

662
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:17,110
What about me picking her up now?

663
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:18,660
I've just finished my work.

664
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,310
No need for that, I'll send her now.

665
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:21,780
Thank you very much.

666
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:22,910
You're welcome.

667
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:28,610
YTN, please move your car out.

668
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:30,060
Give me the car key.

669
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:32,210
The key's here.

670
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:33,260
Who's that?

671
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,080
The father of the kid who took the video.

672
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,500
Lee Ahn's father.

673
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:39,010
I'll get the weapon out first.

674
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,130
Let's go.

675
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:41,330
You play golf?

676
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:42,960
No, I don't play that.

677
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,310
Let's go.

678
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,510
That guy lives here?

679
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:02,230
The address is here.

680
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:04,230
Sorry, Min-seon.

681
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:05,780
Lee Ahn will come to our home later.

682
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:06,910
She'll stay with us for several days.

683
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:08,360
You two stay at home. Don't go out.

684
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,660
I'll go back once I finish my work.

685
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,060
That ambulance! Is that the stolen one?

686
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:22,660
This way.

687
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:39,080
Come on. Let's set off all the Haba inside.

688
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:48,660
What's that?

689
00:45:58,260 --> 00:45:59,530
Another car's here.

690
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,080
Park Tae-seok.

691
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,680
Ouch! Ouch!

692
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:27,360
Min Gae-in!

693
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:28,580
Lee Ahn's dad?

694
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,980
Hide yourselves! Hide!

695
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,010
Everything in place. Ready to go.

696
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,530
Just go back and prevent everything

697
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:06,860
from happening before Haba breaks out.

698
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,210
Go to another time.

699
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:21,880
What's that?

700
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:42,530
-=8:55 a.m. 25th September 2022=-

701
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:45,730
So you came here from the future 10 years ago
-=8:55 a.m. 25th September 2022=-

702
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:47,680
because of that.
-=8:55 a.m. 25th September 2022=-

703
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,770
-=8:55 a.m. 25th September 2022=-

704
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:55,030
So you're chasing after me for this?

705
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:57,260
Why do you need this?

706
00:47:57,310 --> 00:47:58,280
For money?

707
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:01,760
Why would I need this?

708
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:06,060
Let me see where the story begins.

709
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:09,910
This is not the first time I've saved you.

710
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,930
Your name is Lee Ahn, right?

711
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:15,980
Who are you?

712
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:17,260
How come you know my name?

713
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:19,360
Don't you remember the things
back in your childhood?

714
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,730
You fell into the water and I saved you.

715
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:23,480
You?

716
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,440
I know it's hard.

717
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:28,780
But try and imagine me as a child.

718
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:45,580
What's your name? I'm Mureuk.

719
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:46,960
Lee Ahn.

720
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:48,560
Lee Ahn.

721
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:50,560
Lee Ahn.

722
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:53,610
You're that little brat?

723
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:55,280
What brat?

724
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,330
So you're alive!

725
00:48:58,810 --> 00:48:59,960
What's your name?

726
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:01,410
I remember you have a moody name.

727
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:02,430
It's Mureuk.

728
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:03,260
Not moody.

729
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:06,730
So will you return the favor?

730
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:09,860
It's lucky I found you.

731
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:12,880
I've been longing to meet you again.

732
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:15,460
You're the boy back then.

733
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,680
But

734
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:21,610
what's Designer?

735
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:27,230
How come you know that?

736
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:30,260
Where did you hear this?

737
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:32,430
When I saved you from the water

738
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:34,110
and climbed up the hill,

739
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,760
I saw something strange.

740
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:40,760
He walked towards me and said
that he found a human being.

741
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:47,080
I found you, human.

742
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:56,980
It's that monster that
got into my body, right?

743
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:59,130
From that day on,

744
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:00,860
I would lose my memory from time to time.

745
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,930
If you stab me with the Sword,
the monster will come out, right?

746
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:07,930
If it comes out from my body,

747
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:08,880
just you kill it.

748
00:50:09,830 --> 00:50:11,460
No, don't do that.

749
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:14,130
Whatever is inside your body,

750
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,580
just let it be.

751
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:19,080
You just live like this.

752
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:22,630
Just live like this?

753
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:24,830
Then what am I?

754
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:26,760
If there is a monster inside me,

755
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:27,930
what am I?

756
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:35,830
So the monster will die only when I'm dead.

757
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,060
So you're meant to kill me.

758
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:45,160
Maybe I was meant to die when I was born.

759
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,810
Why am I alive?

760
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,310
My dad, Thunder,

761
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,010
all the uncles of the busking group

762
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,280
and you saved me

763
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,630
so that I could save others.

764
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:04,510
You are who you are,

765
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:07,580
no matter what's inside of you.

766
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:11,430
I'm none of those.

767
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:15,430
Good for you.

768
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,060
That's you.

769
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:18,710
Don't forget the way you are.

770
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:22,110
I won't forget you either.

771
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:31,060
What are you doing? Take my hand.

772
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:38,580
I'm taking the Divine Sword.

773
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:04,080
Did you find Gaedong in Hwangneung Mountain?

774
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,780
Yeah, I've been tracking them.

775
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:09,460
Bring him in.

776
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,880
Then move him to the Byongnan Garden House.

777
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,780
What to do with the woman who fired Thunder?

778
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:17,280
Just wait.

779
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,810
She'll come for this stuff anyway.

780
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:35,730
But no matter how I think about it,

781
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:37,760
how did you just meet the person from your childhood?

782
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,480
Oh, there's such a thing as a coincidence.

783
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:42,330
These are the red pines in front of the yard.

784
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:44,610
What's that supposed to mean?

785
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:45,960
Someone's the yard.

786
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,680
And some are red pine

787
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:50,760
There's a red pine right in front of the yard.

788
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:52,580
There are no coincidences.

789
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,360
It's all fate.

790
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:55,680
And so it is with us.

791
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:58,630
How could I have known such a profound meaning?

792
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:00,360
You're doing it again.

793
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,530
So where did the red pine go?

794
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:04,730
Is that what she's here for?

795
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:06,460
Something like a crooked stone altar.

796
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:08,410
The one Gaedong  asked us to find.

797
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:09,380
It's called Thunder or something.

798
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:10,810
Isn't it painted on his wall?

799
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:13,260
In addition to the painting, there's another strange thing.

800
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:15,110
Did he have to tell her

801
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,030
about that thing in his house?

802
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:33,510
Giddyup! Giddyup!

803
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:36,480
It's for an arrest.

804
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,980
Looks like they're after the shooting-thunder girl.

805
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:41,310
I hear the reward is very high.

806
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,130
We have to catch her before we can get the money.

807
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:44,210
What to do?

808
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:47,130
The shooting-thunder girl was said to be particularly handsome.

809
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:50,280
We have to feel how she is like before we kill her.

810
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:53,580
I heard she's married to

811
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:54,660
a guy who looks like an idiot.

812
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,280
I'm drunk.

813
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,360
Let's get her too.

814
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,430
-Let's go. - Ouch.

815
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:05,430
What are you staring at? You look like an idiot.

816
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:14,530
Who says I look like a fool?

817
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:16,880
In the Lotus Sutra there is this sentence

818
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,780
Those who meet will leave. Those who go will return.

819
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:21,080
It's been quite a night for ideas.

820
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,730
Does it mean people are bound to meet again after they've been apart?

821
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:25,110
No, it means money.

822
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,030
Left King.

823
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:27,530
It smells like she is in this way.

824
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:28,710
Let's go.

825
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:34,580
This way.

826
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:37,180
You really know how to smell.

827
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,480
I thought she was dead, but she was asleep.

828
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:53,530
Should we wake her up?

829
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:55,910
It's cold to leave it like this.

830
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:04,330
It's okay. It's us.

831
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:08,730
All the Taoist priests in the country are looking for you.

832
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:11,980
How many days have you not slept?

833
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:13,130
Three days

834
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,030
Why are you here again?

835
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:17,780
I thought we agreed not to see each other anymore.

836
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:18,660
Sure we agreed.

837
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:19,730
But, uh.

838
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:22,860
Promises are made to be broken.

839
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:25,880
And we're telling you, that thing you're looking for...

840
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:26,930
What I'm looking for...

841
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:27,730
That

842
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:29,930
Thunder

843
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:31,930
Do you know where it is?

844
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:55,130
-=Run, you fool!=-

845
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:00,160
Where is Thunder?

846
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,930
It's a good drawing.

847
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:07,430
That's what you said you'd show me, the painting?

848
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:09,230
No, this one.

849
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:37,130
Mureuk, get out.

850
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:39,010
Leave her alone for a while.

851
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,460
Thunder, You've been waiting for me for a long time, haven't you?

852
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:47,510
Thunder

853
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:49,460
Thunder

854
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,310
Thunder, is that alive?

855
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:55,510
Yep.

856
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:57,610
It's energy.

857
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:00,080
There's no energy left, so it can't react.

858
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:02,110
Where does that put the energy?

859
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:11,630
It's that guy.

860
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:15,930
Look there, it's me.

861
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:20,130
It's those guys, wait.

862
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:24,510
You're the one I'm looking at.

863
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:31,460
Those two over there,

864
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:33,510
Come out. Don't hide.

865
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:36,710
Run! Run! Run!

866
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:38,360
Let's go together.

867
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:47,030
Stop.

868
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:49,230
Let's find the ship first, Thunder.

869
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:50,860
We have to go home.

870
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:52,480
Here you are.

871
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,010
Are you going back to the future now?

872
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:55,960
Yes.

873
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:00,260
So we're splitting up again?

874
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:05,660
You gotta watch out for the cats.

875
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:07,680
They may come after you again.

876
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,660
No, I have to warn them.

877
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:14,030
Those guys, they'll probably be after you the whole time.

878
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:16,260
They need to be taught a lesson.

879
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,180
I'm gonna have to do something about that.

880
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:22,310
Left King, Right King.

881
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:25,210
Where'd you go?

882
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,780
It's here. It's here.

883
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:37,930
How did you know I was here

884
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:39,380
and be right here?

885
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:40,280
Do you know each other?

886
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,930
Are they the ones you're looking for?

887
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:42,830
Do you know us?

888
00:58:42,830 --> 00:58:44,880
I know. Left King and Right King.

889
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:47,130
Who are Left King and Right King?

890
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:48,530
The guys I saw ten years ago

891
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:49,910
appear again.

892
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:51,110
Really?

893
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:53,560
Ouch. What did that mean ten years ago?

894
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:57,060
Come on. Come on.

895
00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:00,310
Who are you?

896
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:01,210
Don't come over here.

897
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:04,910
Who are you?

898
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:09,010
Leave us alone. Did we do something wrong?

899
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:12,010
We just happened to meet here ten years ago.

900
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:15,810
Meet here?

901
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:18,860
We?

902
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:25,980
Ten years ago?

903
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,130
Gaedong

904
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:33,260
Right King.

905
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:34,580
Gaedong, why are you here?

906
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:35,430
Do you see Left King?

907
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:36,480
Yes.

908
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:39,930
Well, I need to talk to you.

909
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:41,960
Hey, hey, you can't go.

910
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,180
You can't go over there.

911
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,830
I have something to tell you.

912
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:48,860
Are you Gaedong?

913
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:50,980
Yes, why?

914
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:51,960
You have to come with us.

915
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:52,980
Where?

916
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,510
Byongnan Garden House

917
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:56,830
Why?

918
00:59:57,810 --> 00:59:59,380
Let it off!

919
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:14,800
Right King.

920
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,340
Left, Left King.

921
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:42,500
Right King. My body's weird.

922
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:44,220
No, no, it's okay.

923
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:46,140
Mureuk is here.

924
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:48,930
What's wrong with Left King?

925
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,540
There's a bunch of Taoist guys who are catching Gaedong and let Left King...

926
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:52,470
Stand up.

927
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:53,940
Let's go. Let's go.

928
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:00,730
What's going on?

929
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:05,830
Why am I vanishing?

930
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,310
Am I going to die?

931
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:08,880
Let's go back to the fan.

932
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:11,220
Left King.

933
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:22,840
Thunder.

934
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:25,520
Are you alive?

935
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:34,100
Left King.

936
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:42,870
Thunder.

937
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:49,560
Right King, is Left King dead?

938
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:52,200
Gaedong seems to know something.

939
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:54,100
Mureuk

940
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:56,600
Let's go to Byongnan Garden House.

941
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:03,700
-=Byongnan Garden House=-

942
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:09,800
We brought Gaedong here.

943
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:12,260
Go ahead, Ja-jang.

944
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:17,770
Ten years ago, a young student of Hyungam

945
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:22,130
was expelled because he was possessed by a monster

946
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:24,670
which is controlled by a fan.

947
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:42,310
Did someone take the iron car in the water?

948
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:45,190
I heard it was taken to the Byongnan Garden House last night. By masked priests.

949
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:51,960
We're at Byongnan Garden House.

950
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,410
-Let's go. - Yeah.

951
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,230
Mureuk must've been here

952
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,520
if he's chasing after Ja-jang.

953
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:06,310
Wait.

954
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:07,960
It's really weird.

955
01:03:07,970 --> 01:03:09,300
Why isn't there anyone?

956
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:12,800
Anyone?

957
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:15,410
Anyone?

958
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:18,310
Aren't they here to arrest someone?

959
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:19,680
Why did they all die here?

960
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:22,730
And the masked Taoist priest.

961
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:33,880
This guy is Neung-pa. What are you doing here?

962
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:37,790
I'm the god of the mountain, and you're always calling me that 'guy'?

963
01:03:38,070 --> 01:03:41,350
It's because you didn't pay for the Divine Sword.

964
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,990
Why did they all die over there?

965
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:45,680
I came and found them all dead.

966
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:47,050
There's a monster here.

967
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:47,670
Ja-jang?

968
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:50,250
Looks like you two are also here to catch Ja-jang.

969
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:51,360
Yeah, where is he?

970
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:53,070
Probably hiding.

971
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,780
Wait, I heard someone on the second floor.

972
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:01,490
It's a bait.

973
01:04:02,330 --> 01:04:03,230
For who?

974
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:03,760
Shh.

975
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:24,500
Mureuk!

976
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:25,440
We found them tow!

977
01:04:25,450 --> 01:04:27,420
Ja-jang? Where's Ja-jang?

978
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:29,050
-Shh. - You be quiet, boy.

979
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:30,410
Where's our package?

980
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:33,210
Mureuk

981
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:55,130
Gaedong

982
01:04:56,190 --> 01:04:56,880
Gaedong

983
01:04:57,210 --> 01:04:59,080
I have a sword wound.

984
01:04:59,090 --> 01:05:00,410
Who did this? Is it Ja-jang?

985
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:02,850
It's in Hwangneung Mountain.

986
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,650
It's about to bite.

987
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:13,600
Ten years ago, a young student of Hyungam was expelled

988
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,020
whose name is Mureuk.

989
01:05:17,670 --> 01:05:20,050
Gaedong isn't the one Ja-jang's looking for.

990
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:24,270
Get out of here. Come on.

991
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:42,820
The woodsmen said they'd seen you ten years ago.

992
01:05:42,830 --> 01:05:44,790
Did anyone see me ten years ago?

993
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:48,630
They said you came out of there.

994
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:51,430
Where?

995
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:56,180
The one the girl was looking for.

996
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:59,310
Gaedong. Gaedong.

997
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,530
Okay, finally.

998
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:18,470
What do we do now, Thunder?

999
01:06:23,070 --> 01:06:23,900
Thunder

1000
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:26,460
Thunder

1001
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:30,610
The one the girl was looking for.

1002
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:35,020
The one the girl was looking for.

1003
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:10,360
It's the monster.

1004
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:29,670
Right King, keep it together.

1005
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,000
Mureuk

1006
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,450
Right King

1007
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:49,610
Shooting-thunder...

1008
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:51,700
What are you two doing here?

1009
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:03,840
No

1010
01:09:12,130 --> 01:09:13,460
No! No!

1011
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:18,210
No! No!

1012
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:21,420
No!

1013
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:46,560
Got it.

1014
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:49,150
You human.

1015
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:04,720
Mureuk?

1016
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:08,710
Mureuk

1017
01:10:59,470 --> 01:11:00,650
Why me?

1018
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:08,080
What is in that man's body?

1019
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:24,890
My power is dying out.

1020
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:31,560
Have my energy.

1021
01:11:40,990 --> 01:11:43,890
Thunder. Take care of this boy.

1022
01:11:58,100 --> 01:11:59,440
What?

1023
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:00,480
That's scary.

1024
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:04,650
What's this?

1025
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:06,170
An iron?

1026
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:10,730
Beings discovered.

1027
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:15,010
Two cats. Two humans.

1028
01:12:18,910 --> 01:12:20,460
Start copying.

1029
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:17,920
Be sure to kill me with your own hands.

1030
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:41,500
The Designer escaped from prison.

1031
01:13:52,430 --> 01:13:53,080
Lee Ahn.

1032
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:08,070
Ok. Let's go to the future.

1033
01:14:08,530 --> 01:14:12,460
Haba will explode. The prisoners will escape.

1034
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,900
Warning. The time energy is unstable.

1035
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:29,170
What's that?

1036
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:29,510
-=Sep 25th, 2022, 8:55 a.m.=-

1037
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:42,650
Haba will explode in 47 minutes.

1038
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:44,570
Finally.

1039
01:15:44,570 --> 01:15:46,150
Designer is back.

1040
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:49,490
Prisoners here. Wake up.

1041
01:15:49,490 --> 01:15:50,950
Go to help Designer.

1042
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:32,230
Investigator. Found a survivor. It's Sam-sik.

1043
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:33,550
The medical team is going in.

1044
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:34,740
I'll try to stop.

1045
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:39,420
Wait. The team is dangerous.

1046
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:40,520
We can't let them in.

1047
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:43,360
-Get the armed SWAT team in. -What happened?

1048
01:16:43,670 --> 01:16:44,600
Customs Service?

1049
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:46,070
Get her out here.

1050
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,560
Commander Kang Chun-seok of the Eastern Agency

1051
01:16:47,570 --> 01:16:49,840
was attacked by that monster and sent to the hospital.

1052
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:50,820
Medical team

1053
01:16:51,070 --> 01:16:53,820
-can soon carry out tasks. -Wait!

1054
01:16:54,590 --> 01:16:56,450
Evacuate the medical team. The mission is canceled.

1055
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:58,090
What are you doing? Get out!

1056
01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:06,200
Arrest her.

1057
01:17:42,610 --> 01:17:44,320
Medical team. Secret Service team. Retreat.

1058
01:17:44,590 --> 01:17:45,670
Can you confirm the viewing distance?

1059
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:50,600
Stay still. Something is  ahead.

1060
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:52,440
What's that?

1061
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:53,820
The survivor

1062
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:55,260
is in the air.

1063
01:18:09,170 --> 01:18:10,590
Report what happened.

1064
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:42,840
Where are we?

1065
01:18:43,850 --> 01:18:44,890
In the future?

1066
01:18:45,630 --> 01:18:47,110
Is Yi Seong-gye the king?

1067
01:18:47,950 --> 01:18:48,720
No?

1068
01:18:50,310 --> 01:18:52,450
Where are we? How do we go back?

1069
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:53,920
We have to find a horse.

1070
01:18:57,930 --> 01:19:00,590
The Divine Sword is in this era.

1071
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:03,180
Where is the Divine Sword?

1072
01:19:03,970 --> 01:19:08,020
North by Northwest. 12.4. Only the Sword can prevent the explosion.

1073
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:09,810
Get it back.

1074
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:11,400
Kill anyone who gets

1075
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:12,690
in your way.

1076
01:19:18,110 --> 01:19:19,520
Kill anyone who gets in your way.

1077
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:32,860
Sir. Sir.

1078
01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:35,780
Hey. What are you doing?

1079
01:19:35,790 --> 01:19:36,720
If you are not a member, go out.

1080
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:37,670
Silence.

1081
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:38,760
We may be in the wrong place.

1082
01:19:38,770 --> 01:19:40,080
No. We don't.

1083
01:19:40,090 --> 01:19:41,090
There are monsters.

1084
01:19:41,230 --> 01:19:41,720
Where?

1085
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:43,180
There.

Step aside.

1092
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:55,970
What's going on?

1093
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:03,910
Monster!

1094
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:05,640
Monster!

1095
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:18,600
Where is it?

1096
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:20,240
It ran away.

1097
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:23,590
Why can't this stop?

1098
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,270
Stop it!

Who called the police?

Here. Here.

Ok.

1111
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:43,140
Turn off the machine.

1112
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:47,750
Please come down.

1113
01:20:48,430 --> 01:20:49,230

1114

Drop the gun.

1115
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:55,020
They have this.

1116
01:20:55,950 --> 01:20:57,700
Do you know the shooting-thunder girl?

1117

Who am I?

1125
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:41,420
It will take your whole life

to find the answer.

1127

Oh no.

1129
01:21:47,350 --> 01:21:49,400
Are you noble?

You seems like have noble blood.

How did you break this?

1132

We are gods.

1133

Someone is approaching.

1134
01:22:01,510 --> 01:22:02,350
Who?

1135
01:22:03,230 --> 01:22:04,320
Closer.

1136
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:05,190

1137
01:22:06,980 --> 01:22:07,760
There.

1138
01:22:33,510 --> 01:22:34,270
Help me.

01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:36,080
Cheongwoon.

01:23:08,470 --> 01:23:09,940
The thunder.

1141
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:25,560
Where is Lee Ahn?

1142
01:23:26,470 --> 01:23:27,300
Run!

1143
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:37,780
Run!

1144
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:40,340
Quick! Quick!

1145
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:44,940
Why is he still chasing us?

1146
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:46,190
He's chasing us?

1147
01:23:46,190 --> 01:23:47,740
You two? Why?

1148
01:23:47,740 --> 01:23:49,230
For the Divine Sword.

1149
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:51,180
Where did you come from?

1150
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:53,400
We ran from the woman called Lee Ahn.

1151
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:54,270
Lee Ahn.

1152
01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:54,880
Wait.

1153
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:55,400
Lee Ahn.

1154
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:00,460
Are you talking about her?

1155
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:00,880
What?

1156
01:24:01,070 --> 01:24:02,500
They look alike.

1157
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:04,510
I feel weird.

1158
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:06,040
She comes.

1159
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:07,830
Lee Ahn is coming.

1160
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:09,560
Run. Run.

1161
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:13,580
Run.

1162
01:24:26,350 --> 01:24:27,870
The train is about to set off.

1163
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:30,320
Start the engine.

1164
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:31,590
Start it.

1165
01:24:31,590 --> 01:24:32,790
Where is here?

1166
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:03,630
Min-seon.

1167
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:06,270
Aunt. I just arrived at Lee Ahn's home.

1168
01:25:06,270 --> 01:25:07,230
Why do you go there?

1169
01:25:07,230 --> 01:25:09,110
She didn't come. So I'm here to pick her up.

1170
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:11,750
But I found something strange.

1171
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:14,920
The uncle who had been on the news is here.

1172
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:18,840
I saw him. I saw him.

1173
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:19,670
Aunt. Wait.

1174
01:25:19,670 --> 01:25:20,820
Leave there.

1175
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:22,200
No.

1176
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:23,680
I'll go there. Hide yourself.

1177
01:25:59,350 --> 01:26:00,070
Mureuk.

1178
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:02,750
Mureuk.

1179
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:07,590
Mureuk.

1180
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:14,830
Who are you?

1181
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:16,460
I'm the Program.

1182
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:19,390
Mr. Po? Mr. Po. Are you Mr. Po?

1183
01:26:19,390 --> 01:26:21,640
We've known each other for ten years. Don't you know me?

1184
01:26:21,950 --> 01:26:23,510
Left King and Right King.

1185
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:25,180
What do you mean?

1186
01:26:25,830 --> 01:26:26,580
Woman.

1187
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:29,120
Where is that woman?

1188
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:42,590
What's this?

1189
01:26:44,190 --> 01:26:46,550
Let's start the attack system.

1190
01:26:46,630 --> 01:26:48,750
Start what?

1191
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,660
No. No. No.

1192
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:03,040
Mureuk. Get up.

1193
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:06,390
Good.

1194
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:08,380
Get up. We should go.

1195
01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:10,030
Finally.

1196
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:12,680
Don't move.

1197
01:27:12,740 --> 01:27:14,280
We will go, too.

1198
01:27:23,030 --> 01:27:24,200
It's gone.

1199
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:26,760
The energy is unstable.

1200
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:28,580
Which means,

1201
01:27:28,670 --> 01:27:31,760
the energy is here.

1202
01:27:33,550 --> 01:27:34,430
Yes.

1203
01:27:36,830 --> 01:27:38,800
The energy is here.

1204
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:42,800
Good.

1205
01:27:43,470 --> 01:27:44,320
Ok.

1206
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:46,680
Let's go back again with this.

1207
01:27:52,270 --> 01:27:53,900
I can see the world.

1208
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:55,680
Ok.

1209
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:15,800
We are ready to take a ride.

1210
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:17,590
Mureuk. It's time to leave.

1211
01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:18,540
To where?

1212
01:28:18,950 --> 01:28:20,400
Don't you want to save that woman?

1213
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,580
Woman.

1214
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:23,160
Didn't she ask me to kill her?

1215
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:26,240
Don't believe her.

1216
01:28:26,950 --> 01:28:28,310
Where are we going?

1217
01:28:29,310 --> 01:28:30,070
Future.

1218
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:31,670
The year of 2022.

1219
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:43,140
Let's go.

1220
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:52,280
Future.

1221
01:28:53,270 --> 01:28:55,120
Can't believe I see it again.

1222
01:29:09,390 --> 01:29:12,060
Is this the future that the woman was talking about?

1223
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:13,580
Is it?

1224
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:14,700
Congratulations.

1225
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:16,030
You are in the future.

1226
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:18,150
Taxi.

1227
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:19,550
Taxi.

1228
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:21,390
What is taxi?

1229
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:23,720
When you shout taxi, it can take you to anywhere you want.

1230
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:25,120
Let's go.

1231
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:26,060
Wait.

1232
01:29:26,470 --> 01:29:28,300
Why is it always following us?

1233
01:29:28,590 --> 01:29:30,480
The energy is unstable.

1234
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:33,700
It connects Byongnan Garden House and here. Really unstable.

1235
01:29:33,790 --> 01:29:36,140
But don't worry.

1236
01:29:36,310 --> 01:29:38,360
I will send you back when all is over.

1237
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:40,910
Fourteen minutes before the explosion.

1238
01:29:41,150 --> 01:29:42,150
Let's go.

1239
01:29:48,870 --> 01:29:50,370
-=Korea Daily=-

1240
01:29:50,830 --> 01:29:51,680
Are you okay?

1241
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:57,870
I'm Min Gae-in, a policeman. I need to borrow your car.

1242
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:03,720
Delicious.

1243
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:04,430
Let's go.

1244
01:30:17,790 --> 01:30:18,960
Run.

1245
01:30:23,620 --> 01:30:24,670
Throw a charm.

1246
01:30:24,790 --> 01:30:25,670
Charm.

1247
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:27,840
There are only two charms.

1248
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:25,420
Charm.

1249
01:31:26,070 --> 01:31:27,430
We are done.

1250
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:45,670
Wait. The train is heading to my home.

1251
01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:48,480
Mureuk. Are you ready?

1252
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:50,270
Of course.

1253
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:52,720
What to prepare?

1254
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:53,860
Your arms.

1255
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:58,700
Right.

1256
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:00,600
We have to give it to her.

1257
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,390
Give her? How?

1258
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:04,580
Your hand.

1259
01:32:05,260 --> 01:32:06,870
What?

1260
01:32:13,390 --> 01:32:15,160
Prisoner 8975.

1261
01:32:15,870 --> 01:32:16,800
Mureuk.

1262
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:17,310
What?

1263
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:21,220
Mureuk. What are you doing? Why don't you come up?

1264
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:24,590
Sir. I will.

1265
01:33:17,630 --> 01:33:18,710
See you later.

1266
01:33:31,830 --> 01:33:33,260
I got it. I got it.

1267
01:33:44,420 --> 01:33:45,880
Any more weapon?

1268
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:48,220
They were all left.

1269
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:01,920
-Catch it. -Heukseol.

1270
01:34:03,470 --> 01:34:05,760
Run.

1271
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:32,640
Remember?

1272
01:34:32,740 --> 01:34:34,790
Use the Divine Sword to save people.

1273
01:34:34,790 --> 01:34:35,880
Memory.

1274
01:34:38,950 --> 01:34:40,150
Didn't you say

1275
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:44,100
that you are who you are, no matter what's inside of you?

1276
01:34:44,270 --> 01:34:45,300
It's okay.

1277
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:49,920
Don't.

1278
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:55,960
What are you doing?

1279
01:34:57,100 --> 01:34:58,460
This is not mine.

1280
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:01,110
I keep it just for a while.

1281
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:19,600
Take out the prisoner.

1282
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:40,550
Help the Designer to get out of prison.

1283
01:36:13,120 --> 01:36:14,550
No.

1284
01:37:45,070 --> 01:37:46,910
Five minutes before the explosion.

1285
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:57,750
Fine.

1286
01:37:57,940 --> 01:38:00,140
Receive the energy and prevent the explosion.

1287
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:01,940
Lee Ahn. Get up.

1288
01:39:03,110 --> 01:39:05,020
Where is the weapon?

1289
01:39:45,910 --> 01:39:47,150
Who is it?

1290
01:39:47,660 --> 01:39:48,600
Neung-pa.

1291
01:39:48,790 --> 01:39:50,600
Why is Neung-pa here?

1292
01:39:51,150 --> 01:39:53,440
Why is his sword in the future?

1293
01:39:58,790 --> 01:40:00,070
It stands up.

1294
01:40:16,770 --> 01:40:19,440
Min-seon. Aunt is here. Hide yourself.

1295
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:23,100
Who are you?

1296
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:25,470
Min Gae-in, a descendant of Neung-pa, greets you.

1297
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:28,340
Are you two the masters of this weapon?

1298
01:40:29,660 --> 01:40:31,890
Tell my great descendants.

1299
01:40:33,830 --> 01:40:37,900
The two gods and Mureuk left the weapon and went to the future.

1300
01:40:43,640 --> 01:40:46,240
My descendants of 2022

1301
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:48,220
should find them and give them the weapon

1302
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:50,640
when the monsters appear.

1303
01:40:56,540 --> 01:40:58,350
What should I do then?

1304
01:40:58,820 --> 01:41:00,510
Let's work together to catch the monster.

1305
01:41:01,950 --> 01:41:03,360
What are you doing? Taoist Mureuk.

1306
01:41:03,980 --> 01:41:05,360
What Taoist?

1307
01:41:06,010 --> 01:41:08,040
I'm not an expert in any field.

1308
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:10,120
Get up. My disciple.

1309
01:41:11,550 --> 01:41:13,420
I don't have that thing in my body.

1310
01:41:14,350 --> 01:41:16,000
I am totally useless now.

1311
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:21,570
The fan.

1312
01:41:23,270 --> 01:41:25,040
I remember I left it there.

1313
01:41:36,930 --> 01:41:38,150
Prajnaparamita.

1314
01:41:41,540 --> 01:41:42,660
Prajnaparamita.

1315
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:03,480
Why am I reciting the mantra?

1316
01:42:04,420 --> 01:42:06,900
It is already in my mind.

1317
01:42:06,900 --> 01:42:08,370
Are you fine? My disciple.

1318
01:42:08,370 --> 01:42:09,510
Get up.

1319
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:11,410
He's my disciple.

1320
01:42:32,590 --> 01:42:33,920
Mureuk

1321
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:35,730
greets to you all.

1322
01:42:58,020 --> 01:43:00,010
Nine percent chance of winning.

1323
01:43:00,610 --> 01:43:01,330
Ten.

1324
01:43:02,230 --> 01:43:03,160
Sixteen.

1325
01:43:06,830 --> 01:43:08,390
Dad.

1326
01:43:09,530 --> 01:43:10,600
Why is it elevated?

1327
01:43:11,870 --> 01:43:13,270
I'm going to die.

1328
01:43:17,230 --> 01:43:18,840
I can see the future.

1329
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:21,420
Lee Ahn will solve all.

1330
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:23,320
Lee Ahn will solve all.

1331
01:43:23,650 --> 01:43:24,950
With other humans.

1332
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:27,060
Humans cannot solve it.

1333
01:43:28,140 --> 01:43:29,320
They don't have that ability.

1334
01:43:30,020 --> 01:43:31,640
It's impossible when there's only one human.

1335
01:43:33,260 --> 01:43:35,110
But now we are together.

1336
01:43:36,950 --> 01:43:38,540
Can you see it?

1337
01:43:40,530 --> 01:43:41,880
I can see it in my eyes.

1338
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:45,230
I'll send it to you.

1339
01:44:09,790 --> 01:44:10,640
Thunder.

1340
01:44:15,390 --> 01:44:17,440
Insert that into the heart of the ship.

1341
01:45:01,170 --> 01:45:02,120
Come on.

1342
01:45:03,190 --> 01:45:04,470
Go.

1343
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:19,140
Go.

1344
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:38,870
Appearance.

1345
01:45:44,190 --> 01:45:46,370
You are dead. Come.

1346
01:45:48,460 --> 01:45:49,630
Go.

1347
01:45:49,630 --> 01:45:52,000
I'll kill you now.

1348
01:45:52,620 --> 01:45:54,080
Come on.

1349
01:46:01,170 --> 01:46:05,250
Crush. Crush. Crush. Crush.

1350
01:46:06,670 --> 01:46:07,660
Here.

1351
01:46:17,650 --> 01:46:21,790
It's hurt. It's hurt.

1352
01:46:25,420 --> 01:46:26,570
Lee Ahn. It's dangerous.

1353
01:47:04,690 --> 01:47:06,630
Lee Ahn. Run!

1354
01:47:11,990 --> 01:47:13,370
-=Twenty minutes before the explosion=-
Haba will explode in twenty minutes.

1355
01:47:13,370 --> 01:47:13,410
Haba will explode in twenty minutes.

1356
01:47:14,540 --> 01:47:14,630
-=Eliminate the disruptor=-

1357
01:47:14,630 --> 01:47:16,040
Eliminate the disruptor.
-=Eliminate the disruptor=-

1358
01:47:16,040 --> 01:47:16,290
Eliminate the disruptor.

1359
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:26,270
Descendant of Neung-pa.

1360
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:28,300
Drop your sword in here.

1361
01:47:28,300 --> 01:47:29,230
Raise me up.

1362
01:48:11,470 --> 01:48:12,420
No.

1363
01:48:30,260 --> 01:48:31,290
Thunder.

1364
01:48:32,730 --> 01:48:33,810
Did it work?

1365
01:48:57,570 --> 01:48:58,660
Aunt.

1366
01:49:00,470 --> 01:49:01,700
Ahh. What?

1367
01:49:04,210 --> 01:49:05,200
Min-seon.

1368
01:49:11,710 --> 01:49:12,440
Aunt.

1369
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:13,790
Oh my god.

1370
01:49:18,430 --> 01:49:20,370
Don't let it in the body.

1371
01:49:47,780 --> 01:49:49,180
Min-seon. Are you okay?

1372
01:49:50,540 --> 01:49:51,440
Who are you?

1373
01:49:52,310 --> 01:49:53,540
Do you know me?

1374
01:49:57,170 --> 01:49:58,190
Yes.

1375
01:50:06,750 --> 01:50:07,900
Survive.

1376
01:50:10,090 --> 01:50:11,200
It isn't the end

1377
01:50:12,330 --> 01:50:13,950
of getting out of the prison.

1378
01:50:26,090 --> 01:50:27,470
What should we do? Thunder.

1379
01:50:29,150 --> 01:50:30,260
Take it and leave.

1380
01:50:30,980 --> 01:50:33,110
It will come out. It can't be destroyed.

1381
01:50:34,170 --> 01:50:35,120
It won't be stopped.

1382
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:37,290
What if it comes back again?

1383
01:50:39,070 --> 01:50:41,230
We should explode it up there.

1384
01:50:43,590 --> 01:50:45,040
Then you will die.

1385
01:50:47,810 --> 01:50:49,280
I told you.

1386
01:50:50,260 --> 01:50:52,040
I'll take this to the universe.

1387
01:50:54,460 --> 01:50:55,900
It's time.

1388
01:51:07,380 --> 01:51:09,060
That's what Dad said.

1389
01:51:12,030 --> 01:51:13,640
I have Guard's program.

1390
01:51:14,120 --> 01:51:16,440
And also all your memory.

1391
01:51:23,270 --> 01:51:24,320
Is it right? Mureuk.

1392
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:25,780
No. It should be the master.

1393
01:51:27,710 --> 01:51:28,590
Left King.

1394
01:51:29,970 --> 01:51:30,810
Right King.

1395
01:51:31,820 --> 01:51:33,180
I miss you so much.

1396
01:51:33,180 --> 01:51:35,570
Don't cry. Don't cry.

1397
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:38,160
Right King.

1398
01:51:40,100 --> 01:51:41,200
You are alive.

1399
01:51:41,770 --> 01:51:42,870
Of course.

1400
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:45,370
See? I said I am the right arm of my master.

1401
01:51:45,370 --> 01:51:47,830
You are in his front. The right side is me.

1402
01:51:48,060 --> 01:51:48,860
Hey. Mureuk.

1403
01:51:49,660 --> 01:51:52,320
Don't tell anybody that I saved the world.

1404
01:51:52,780 --> 01:51:53,940
I am shy.

1405
01:51:55,460 --> 01:51:57,100
We are going back. Master.

1406
01:51:58,490 --> 01:51:59,440
Where?

1407
01:51:59,630 --> 01:52:01,110
Don't be sad.

1408
01:52:01,580 --> 01:52:03,300
It's like red pine in front of the yard.

1409
01:52:05,350 --> 01:52:07,860
Thank you for your company.

1410
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:09,710
Thank you, too.

1411
01:52:11,770 --> 01:52:12,740
Go back.

1412
01:52:12,930 --> 01:52:13,970
That is about to disappear.

1413
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:21,530
It's time to go back to your era.

1414
01:52:27,650 --> 01:52:28,140
Yes.

1415
01:52:29,070 --> 01:52:30,770
You are the cats.

1416
01:52:31,430 --> 01:52:32,560
Goodbye. Lee Ahn.

1417
01:52:33,810 --> 01:52:34,570
Goodbye.

1418
01:52:36,610 --> 01:52:38,020
See you next time.

1419
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:40,910
He's smiling at me.

1420
01:52:41,370 --> 01:52:42,960
No. He's smiling at me.

1421
01:52:46,680 --> 01:52:50,330
A candy-colored clown they call the sandman

1422
01:52:50,670 --> 01:52:53,790
Tiptoes to my room every night

1423
01:52:54,360 --> 01:52:57,920
Just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper

1424
01:52:58,140 --> 01:52:59,730
Go to sleep

1425
01:52:59,730 --> 01:53:03,760
Everything is all right

1426
01:53:04,470 --> 01:53:08,700
I close my eyes

1427
01:53:09,050 --> 01:53:13,450
Then I drift away

1428
01:53:13,450 --> 01:53:17,810
Into the magic night

1429
01:53:17,810 --> 01:53:22,230
I softly say

1430
01:53:22,230 --> 01:53:26,300
A silent prayer

1431
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:31,020
Like dreamers do

1432
01:53:31,020 --> 01:53:35,390
Then I fall asleep to dream

1433
01:53:35,390 --> 01:53:39,820
My dreams of you

1434
01:53:40,990 --> 01:53:48,740
In dreams I walk with you

1435
01:53:50,100 --> 01:53:57,550
In dreams I talk to you

1436
01:53:58,950 --> 01:54:03,880
In dreams you're mine

1437
01:54:03,880 --> 01:54:11,400
All of the time we're together

1438
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:18,610
In dreams, In dreams

1439
01:54:18,610 --> 01:54:20,870
But just before the dawn

1440
01:54:20,870 --> 01:54:22,300
Everything to be done is done.
But just before the dawn

1441
01:54:22,300 --> 01:54:23,280
But just before the dawn

1442
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:23,970
Yes.
But just before the dawn

1443
01:54:23,970 --> 01:54:25,180
But just before the dawn

1444
01:54:25,950 --> 01:54:27,640
You've got a lot of injuries because of me.

1445
01:54:27,640 --> 01:54:27,940
I awake and find you gone
You've got a lot of injuries because of me.

1446
01:54:27,940 --> 01:54:28,820
I awake and find you gone

1447
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:30,280
No. I'm alright.
I awake and find you gone

1448
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:34,450
I awake and find you gone

1449
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:38,620
I can't help it

1450
01:54:38,670 --> 01:54:41,020
I can't help it

1451
01:54:41,020 --> 01:54:45,140
if I cry

1452
01:54:45,390 --> 01:54:49,120
I remember that you said goodbye

1453
01:54:49,120 --> 01:54:50,590
Thank you. My husband.
I remember that you said goodbye

1454
01:54:50,590 --> 01:54:53,700
I remember that you said goodbye

1455
01:54:54,980 --> 01:55:01,630
It's too bad that all these things

1456
01:55:03,060 --> 01:55:10,730
Can only happen in my dreams

1457
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:20,470
Only in dreams

1458
01:55:21,290 --> 01:55:31,770
In beautiful dreams

1459
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:34,150
-Wow. -Oh my god.

1460
01:55:34,420 --> 01:55:35,140
Oh my god.

1461
01:55:35,380 --> 01:55:37,240
My body is going to fall apart.

1462
01:55:37,670 --> 01:55:39,470
You are on time. You are punctual.

1463
01:55:39,740 --> 01:55:42,070
Suddenly I was very proud of myself.

1464
01:55:42,070 --> 01:55:42,660
Why?

1465
01:55:42,850 --> 01:55:44,290
We saved the world.

1466
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:47,480
-Of course Mureuk has helped. -Right.

1467
01:55:47,480 --> 01:55:49,120
Is Neung-pa still here?

1468
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:50,360
Do you see Neung-pa?

1469
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:52,240
-You come back? -Yes. Neung-pa.

1470
01:55:52,330 --> 01:55:54,030
We saved the world.

1471
01:55:54,050 --> 01:55:55,670
And we met your descendants.

1472
01:55:55,980 --> 01:55:56,980
But can you see us?

1473
01:55:58,250 --> 01:56:00,250
Get up and tell me everything.

1474
01:56:00,250 --> 01:56:01,240
Okay. Okay.

1475
01:56:01,240 --> 01:56:03,310
There's so much to talk about.

1476
01:57:18,380 --> 01:57:19,080
What?

1477
01:57:21,130 --> 01:57:21,940
Wait.

1478
01:57:22,860 --> 01:57:25,640
What did Mr. Po said at that time?

1479
01:57:26,450 --> 01:57:27,160
I know it.

1480
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:30,160
There is still energy.

1481
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:31,570
Wait.

1482
01:57:32,100 --> 01:57:33,800
Why is it always following us?

1483
01:57:34,100 --> 01:57:35,950
The energy is unstable.

1484
01:57:36,180 --> 01:57:39,070
It connects Byongnan Garden House and here.

1485
01:57:49,610 --> 01:57:51,840
Byongnan Garden House.

1486
01:57:52,140 --> 01:57:54,140
Unstable connection.

1487
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:04,470
It reopened.

1488
01:58:05,860 --> 01:58:07,920
Let's drink wine.

1489
01:58:09,460 --> 01:58:11,160
Why is Mureuk still here? What are you doing?

1490
01:58:11,770 --> 01:58:13,150
Red pine in front of the yard.

1491
01:58:14,110 --> 01:58:14,720
What?

1492
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:17,240
I will go there again.

1493
01:58:17,670 --> 01:58:19,030
There's something I didn't tell her.
