Come in if you dare.

6
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,211
The living.

7
00:03:21,346 --> 00:03:22,719
The dead.

8
00:03:22,854 --> 00:03:24,846
Can they coexist?

9
00:03:24,982 --> 00:03:27,016
That's what
we're here to find out.

10
00:03:27,152 --> 00:03:30,687
My name is Lydia Deetz,
and welcome to <i>Ghost House.</i>

11
00:03:34,726 --> 00:03:36,356
Joining us in the attic tonight

12
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:40,028
are Emmet and Jody Welch,
from Cleghorn, Wisconsin.

13
00:03:40,163 --> 00:03:43,269
Along with their dog, Taco.

14
00:03:43,405 --> 00:03:44,735
And we're gonna hear about how

15
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:48,742
their dream home
became a ghost house.

16
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,776
I've been a psychic mediator
for over 15 years.

17
00:03:53,912 --> 00:03:55,515
But nothing
could have prepared me

18
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,379
for what I encountered
when I visited

19
00:03:57,514 --> 00:03:58,618
the Welch farm.

20
00:04:00,017 --> 00:04:01,337
Here's a preview.

21
00:04:02,057 --> 00:04:03,286
Be warned,

22
00:04:03,422 --> 00:04:04,422
it's intense.

23
00:04:06,863 --> 00:04:09,923
<i>I don't know what I'm gonna
find behind this door,</i>

24
00:04:10,058 --> 00:04:13,336
<i>but it doesn't want me here.</i>

25
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,112
I feel a dark presence.

26
00:04:33,248 --> 00:04:35,087
We need to leave! Now!

27
00:04:38,422 --> 00:04:42,259
Emmet, are you ready to hear
about your paranormal visitors?

28
00:04:42,394 --> 00:04:43,394
Bring it on.

29
00:04:43,463 --> 00:04:44,966
How about you, Jody?

30
00:04:45,102 --> 00:04:46,598
Haven't slept a wink

31
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:49,130
since we moved
into that darned house.

32
00:04:49,266 --> 00:04:52,470
Taco was so freaked out,
he goes to the bathroom

33
00:04:52,606 --> 00:04:54,967
in his doggy bed every night.

34
00:04:55,103 --> 00:04:57,105
It's been a living nightmare.

35
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,477
Confronting the unknown.
Conquering your fears.

36
00:05:01,613 --> 00:05:03,445
There's nothing harder.

37
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,813
But don't worry.

38
00:05:04,948 --> 00:05:06,317
I'll be right by your...

39
00:05:09,487 --> 00:05:10,692
What the...

40
00:05:10,828 --> 00:05:11,856
No.

41
00:05:13,595 --> 00:05:14,954
No, no.

42
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:16,169
What's going on?

43
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:18,592
- I don't know.
- Go!

44
00:05:18,727 --> 00:05:20,532
No. No.

45
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:22,497
- Uh...
- You're doing great.

46
00:05:22,632 --> 00:05:24,669
I'm...

47
00:05:24,804 --> 00:05:27,210
Need a break?

48
00:05:27,346 --> 00:05:29,168
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's take a break.

49
00:05:29,304 --> 00:05:32,181
Lydia Deetz,
ladies and gentlemen!

50
00:05:32,316 --> 00:05:33,779
Bravo.

51
00:05:35,714 --> 00:05:36,834
I need five. Make it happen.

52
00:05:37,948 --> 00:05:39,719
Okay, everybody, that's lunch!

53
00:05:50,096 --> 00:05:52,568
I told him
he needed to wear contacts.

54
00:05:52,703 --> 00:05:55,667
But no, Mr. Big Shot Magician
wouldn't listen.

55
00:05:55,803 --> 00:05:57,404
Oh, can you
give it a rest, Nadia?

56
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:59,266
I'm having a really shitty day.

57
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,807
Hmm?

58
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:05,514
What happened out there?

59
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,411
You okay?

60
00:06:08,546 --> 00:06:10,119
Yeah, I'm fine.

61
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:12,221
It's these double taping days,

62
00:06:12,357 --> 00:06:14,522
- it can get to me.
- Oh, God.

63
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:16,920
Kills me to see you
feeling like this.

64
00:06:17,056 --> 00:06:18,536
Because when
you're feeling like this,

65
00:06:18,596 --> 00:06:19,668
it just makes me
feel what you're feeling.

66
00:06:19,692 --> 00:06:20,989
So in a weird way it's like,

67
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,759
when you're hurting,
it's hurting me.

68
00:06:22,894 --> 00:06:25,094
- I don't know.
- God, I'm sorry.

69
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:26,989
I... I don't mean to make you
feel like that.

70
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,264
Oh, babe. Hey, it's okay.

71
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:31,279
If anything, it just shows
how connected we are.

72
00:06:33,678 --> 00:06:35,709
It's like we got the same
stupid little heart.

73
00:06:45,355 --> 00:06:47,417
No. You don't need these.

74
00:06:47,552 --> 00:06:48,557
Oh.

75
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:51,418
I have one job, and that is

76
00:06:51,553 --> 00:06:53,463
to make sure that you do not
drown your talents

77
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:55,238
at the bottom
of a bottle of pills, Lydia.

78
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,726
Please...

79
00:06:57,862 --> 00:06:59,398
just to get through today.

80
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:05,272
Okay. But...

81
00:07:05,407 --> 00:07:06,972
this is the last time

82
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:08,754
that I ever dig pills
out of a trash can for you.

83
00:07:08,778 --> 00:07:11,041
Do you understand?
Or a toilet or sink.

84
00:07:12,576 --> 00:07:13,582
Here.

85
00:07:16,451 --> 00:07:18,252
Okay? You got this.

86
00:07:18,387 --> 00:07:19,387
- All right?
- Yeah.

87
00:07:23,955 --> 00:07:26,160
- Is that mine?
- Don't move.

88
00:07:26,295 --> 00:07:28,129
Who's texting me?

89
00:07:28,265 --> 00:07:29,796
Your stupid stepmother.

90
00:07:30,895 --> 00:07:32,293
She's got texting diarrhea.

91
00:07:34,468 --> 00:07:35,468
I have to go.

92
00:07:35,566 --> 00:07:37,131
Lydia...

93
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:38,970
we still have
a segment to finish.

94
00:07:50,146 --> 00:07:51,554
<i>Tell us about</i>

95
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:53,487
<i>the inspiration
for The Human Canvas.</i>

96
00:07:53,622 --> 00:07:54,821
<i>I am my own canvas.</i>

97
00:07:55,786 --> 00:07:57,285
<i>I am my art.</i>

98
00:07:57,421 --> 00:08:00,491
<i>As we know,
art imitates the living.</i>

99
00:08:00,626 --> 00:08:02,159
<i>It feeds me.</i>

100
00:08:02,294 --> 00:08:04,629
<i>And I was not getting
enough nourishment</i>

101
00:08:04,765 --> 00:08:06,601
<i>from the sculpture alone.</i>

102
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:09,429
<i>So, I decided
to broaden my tastes</i>

103
00:08:09,564 --> 00:08:11,567
<i>and it turns out
I am insatiably...</i>

104
00:08:11,703 --> 00:08:12,767
Delia!

105
00:08:12,903 --> 00:08:14,335
Where have you been?

106
00:08:14,471 --> 00:08:16,190
I think I've cried all
the water out of my body.

107
00:08:16,214 --> 00:08:17,712
What happened to Dad?

108
00:08:17,848 --> 00:08:20,175
I'm <i>desolee,</i> Le Tigre!

109
00:08:20,311 --> 00:08:22,542
He is the Picasso
of graffiti artists.

110
00:08:22,677 --> 00:08:24,950
He was tagging me like
the walls of the Paris Métro.

111
00:08:25,086 --> 00:08:26,885
But now he's having
a <i>petite</i> tantrum

112
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,580
because I had to cancel
the performance.

113
00:08:28,687 --> 00:08:30,021
What happened?

114
00:08:30,721 --> 00:08:32,188
What? Oh.

115
00:08:34,298 --> 00:08:35,889
Your father's left me.

116
00:08:36,025 --> 00:08:37,363
He's divorcing you?

117
00:08:37,499 --> 00:08:39,727
What a horrible thought.

118
00:08:39,863 --> 00:08:40,999
No! He's dead!

119
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,567
What?

120
00:08:43,703 --> 00:08:45,168
Daddy's passed away.

121
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,908
How?

122
00:08:50,512 --> 00:08:51,711
He was returning

123
00:08:51,847 --> 00:08:53,247
from his bird-watching
expedition

124
00:08:53,383 --> 00:08:54,681
to the Funafuti Atoll...

125
00:08:56,887 --> 00:08:58,247
<i>...when his plane
went down</i>

126
00:08:58,356 --> 00:08:59,685
<i>in the South Pacific.</i>

127
00:09:04,558 --> 00:09:05,854
A plane crash?

128
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:11,430
<i>That was
his worst nightmare.</i>

129
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:14,896
Actually,
he survived the crash.

130
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:17,067
- He drowned?
- Almost.

131
00:09:17,203 --> 00:09:19,570
But not quite, no.
According to survivors,

132
00:09:19,706 --> 00:09:20,766
Daddy clung onto a wing.

133
00:09:22,505 --> 00:09:23,988
- Over here!
- Come on!

134
00:09:24,012 --> 00:09:26,211
Hey, swim over!
Swim over!

135
00:09:26,347 --> 00:09:27,347
Hey!

136
00:09:28,352 --> 00:09:29,979
So, how did he die?

137
00:09:30,114 --> 00:09:31,644
A shark jumped out of the water

138
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,219
<i>and got him!

139
00:09:33,982 --> 00:09:35,119
Just like that.

140
00:09:36,518 --> 00:09:38,622
I just spoke to him
on Saturday.

141
00:09:38,757 --> 00:09:39,990
He was so excited,

142
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:42,125
he thanked me
for the binoculars,

143
00:09:42,261 --> 00:09:44,464
he said he had observed
the mating rituals

144
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,161
of the Tuamotu sandpiper.

145
00:09:46,297 --> 00:09:48,195
Yes, he flew halfway
around the world

146
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:49,765
to watch birds
do it on a beach.

147
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,904
And it killed him!

148
00:09:52,607 --> 00:09:54,468
We need to tell Astrid.

149
00:09:55,476 --> 00:09:57,240
Oh. Must we?

150
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,975
She's already
such a morbid little thing.

151
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,416
That's if I can even reach her.

152
00:10:00,551 --> 00:10:02,617
We're barely on speaking terms.

153
00:10:02,752 --> 00:10:04,032
Oh, it would kill Charles
to know

154
00:10:04,113 --> 00:10:06,413
I had to cancel my show.

155
00:10:06,548 --> 00:10:07,908
<i>Bonne journée a jamais!</i>

156
00:10:08,952 --> 00:10:10,016
What'd he say?

157
00:10:18,469 --> 00:10:19,509
Did you see that?

158
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,157
<i>Bonjour, monsieur. Ou suis-je?</i>

159
00:10:47,255 --> 00:10:49,326
Where am I?

160
00:10:49,462 --> 00:10:52,926
Down the hall,
second door on the right.

161
00:10:53,062 --> 00:10:54,666
Take a number.

162
00:10:54,801 --> 00:10:56,167
Someone will help you.

163
00:10:57,307 --> 00:10:58,808
Eventually.

164
00:11:01,612 --> 00:11:03,537
Goddamn foreigners.

165
00:11:54,156 --> 00:11:59,128
<i>♪ Night and day,
there's a burning down inside of me ♪</i>

166
00:11:59,263 --> 00:12:05,698
<i>♪ Oh, oh, burning love

180
00:13:41,328 --> 00:13:43,201
Hey, toots!

181
00:13:43,336 --> 00:13:45,534
You're not supposed
to be back here.

182
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:48,678
Don't make me tell you twice.

183
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:54,884
Where is Beetlejuice?

184
00:14:14,004 --> 00:14:20,074
Ugh.

185
00:14:35,593 --> 00:14:37,727
Ghost House!

186
00:14:37,862 --> 00:14:39,001
When you're all
on your third kid

187
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:40,862
and second divorce,

188
00:14:40,997 --> 00:14:42,317
we'll see who gets
the last laugh.

189
00:14:50,101 --> 00:14:51,105
Perfect.

190
00:14:56,013 --> 00:14:57,350
Leave me alone.

191
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:12,762
So it's settled. We'll bring
Charles home to Winter River.

192
00:15:12,897 --> 00:15:14,293
But I've never
hosted a funeral...

193
00:15:14,428 --> 00:15:15,567
I've never hosted anything

194
00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:17,191
without Charles standing there.

195
00:15:17,327 --> 00:15:19,097
Watching me. In awe.

196
00:15:19,232 --> 00:15:20,896
<i>It's Astrid.</i>

197
00:15:21,031 --> 00:15:22,511
<i>- Please don't leave a message.</i>
- She won't pick up.

198
00:15:22,535 --> 00:15:24,567
Maybe I should tell Astrid
about Charles.

199
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:26,798
Might be easier coming from

200
00:15:26,934 --> 00:15:28,440
a non-feminine
masculine archetype.

201
00:15:28,575 --> 00:15:31,141
Well, there aren't any men
left in the family.

202
00:15:31,277 --> 00:15:33,576
Well, no offense taken, Delia.

203
00:15:33,711 --> 00:15:35,413
I'll be a member of the family
soon enough.

204
00:15:36,783 --> 00:15:38,185
In fact,

205
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,857
I might be the perfect person
to tell her.

206
00:15:39,881 --> 00:15:42,083
Having just lost
my own grandfather.

207
00:15:42,219 --> 00:15:44,019
You did? When?

208
00:15:44,154 --> 00:15:45,852
Forty years ago.

209
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:49,293
But in my child body,
that's yesterday.

210
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:50,924
I'm gonna
tell Astrid, okay?

211
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:52,440
Just give me a few minutes
before you come up.

212
00:15:52,464 --> 00:15:54,036
Enough!
I'll handle this.

213
00:15:56,606 --> 00:15:57,606
Astrid!

214
00:15:59,773 --> 00:16:00,773
Astrid!

215
00:16:01,676 --> 00:16:02,803
Astrid!

216
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:06,980
Stop torturing your mother.

217
00:16:07,115 --> 00:16:08,941
I know I usually find it funny,

218
00:16:09,076 --> 00:16:10,624
and only fair
after the way she treated me

219
00:16:10,648 --> 00:16:12,060
when she was your age.

220
00:16:12,084 --> 00:16:13,517
But not today!

221
00:16:14,748 --> 00:16:17,318
Your mummy's lost her daddy.

222
00:16:17,454 --> 00:16:18,687
You've lost your grandpa.

223
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,529
And I've lost my...

224
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:23,032
horny handyman.

225
00:16:24,261 --> 00:16:25,261
Charles.

226
00:16:26,129 --> 00:16:27,630
Charles!

227
00:16:28,462 --> 00:16:31,139
Oh, Charles!

228
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:36,674
Can't believe Grandpa is dead.

229
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:38,889
He's like the only semi-normal
person in this family.

230
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:41,137
We're gonna be in
Winter River for a few weeks.

231
00:16:41,182 --> 00:16:42,645
What do you mean
for a few weeks?

232
00:16:42,781 --> 00:16:44,163
I thought we were just
going for the funeral.

233
00:16:44,187 --> 00:16:45,590
Well, we need to clear out
the house.

234
00:16:45,614 --> 00:16:47,012
Grandpa loved that place.

235
00:16:47,147 --> 00:16:48,768
Yes, and we are going
to honor him

236
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:50,692
with a Grief Collective.

237
00:16:50,827 --> 00:16:52,625
A "Grief Collective"?

238
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:57,996
I am seeing a semi-multimedia
visual manifesto of our loss.

239
00:16:58,132 --> 00:16:59,460
What does loss look like?

240
00:16:59,596 --> 00:17:02,329
Is it just tears? A headstone?

241
00:17:02,464 --> 00:17:03,831
Wilting gladioli?

242
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:07,241
No, we need to unpack
the art of sorrow.

243
00:17:08,805 --> 00:17:11,007
Yeah, that sounds
really traumatic.

244
00:17:11,142 --> 00:17:12,142
I can't go.

245
00:17:12,243 --> 00:17:13,876
I'm our school rep

246
00:17:14,011 --> 00:17:15,792
for our Student Environmental
Conference next week.

247
00:17:15,816 --> 00:17:17,462
We're presenting our demands
on climate change action.

248
00:17:17,486 --> 00:17:19,583
I spoke with the principal,
and they cleared it.

249
00:17:19,718 --> 00:17:21,983
She actually thinks
it's a really good idea.

250
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,997
Yeah, well, I guess when you
donate an entire art center,

251
00:17:24,021 --> 00:17:25,797
the principal becomes your
little puppet on a string.

252
00:17:27,397 --> 00:17:29,117
Well, you're free
to reject your inheritance

253
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,298
when you're living high
off a tree hugger's salary.

254
00:17:34,739 --> 00:17:37,238
What? No! No!

255
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:41,514
Jesus! Okay,
people already know

256
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:43,135
that Lydia Deetz is my mom.

257
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:46,209
Okay, can you stop being
a freak for, like, one second?

258
00:17:46,345 --> 00:17:48,712
- Go back.
- Why?

259
00:17:48,847 --> 00:17:50,395
All right, people already know
you'd rather spend

260
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:52,179
more time with ghosts
than your own daughter.

261
00:18:24,754 --> 00:18:26,747
Jesus, Bob.

262
00:18:26,883 --> 00:18:28,586
Can't you see
I'm concentrating here?

263
00:18:29,287 --> 00:18:30,787
You know, Bob,

264
00:18:30,922 --> 00:18:33,160
long distance relationships
can be difficult.

265
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:34,922
Especially when
one of you is dead

266
00:18:35,057 --> 00:18:36,599
and the other's ignoring you
for 30 years.

267
00:18:36,623 --> 00:18:37,957
But Lydia and I,

268
00:18:38,093 --> 00:18:39,897
we have a definite
psychic connection.

269
00:18:40,033 --> 00:18:41,579
<i>I just need
these people out of my house.</i>

270
00:18:41,603 --> 00:18:44,197
Please hold! Afterlife
Call Center, please hold.

271
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,505
<i>How much
for a premium bio exorcism?</i>

272
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,045
And I'll tell ya something,

273
00:18:48,069 --> 00:18:49,640
she definitely saw me
that last time.

274
00:18:51,112 --> 00:18:52,511
I felt a little tingle.

275
00:18:52,646 --> 00:18:54,018
<i>The money back
guarantee one.</i>

276
00:18:54,042 --> 00:18:55,848
I'm putting your call
through now.

277
00:18:55,983 --> 00:18:57,261
<i>I've just died,
and she's already remarried.</i>

278
00:18:57,285 --> 00:18:58,981
Sell him the honeymoon package.

279
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:00,596
I'll kill the new husband,
and I'll possess the ex-wife.

280
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,100
I'll make her
do some unseemly things,

281
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:03,766
and then I'll post the pics.

282
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,230
<i>Can I pay
in installments?</i>

283
00:19:10,725 --> 00:19:12,024
I'm needed upstairs.

284
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,368
Bob, hold down the fort.

285
00:19:23,475 --> 00:19:24,706
<i>Ou je suis?</i>

286
00:19:24,842 --> 00:19:26,160
- Where am I?
- Take a number,

287
00:19:26,184 --> 00:19:27,504
take a seat.

288
00:19:36,994 --> 00:19:39,620
I'm more of a dog person.

289
00:19:39,755 --> 00:19:42,121
You! Room 515. Now.

290
00:19:47,862 --> 00:19:49,104
- Come on.
- Come on.

291
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,600
Hey,
easy with the suit.

292
00:19:50,637 --> 00:19:51,633
Don't "Detective" me,

293
00:19:51,634 --> 00:19:52,900
you walking disaster.

294
00:19:53,035 --> 00:19:54,515
- We got reports.
- Another protestor.

295
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:55,981
<i>There is a ten-o-nine.</i>

296
00:19:56,005 --> 00:20:00,007
Wolf Jackson,
Afterlife Crime Unit.

297
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:02,218
Let me take a wild stab.

298
00:20:02,752 --> 00:20:03,752
Actor.

299
00:20:03,844 --> 00:20:06,080
Not just any actor.

300
00:20:06,215 --> 00:20:09,418
I've done it all.
For six movies and a reboot,

301
00:20:09,554 --> 00:20:11,722
I became Frank Hardballer.

302
00:20:11,857 --> 00:20:14,095
Doing my own stunts
was non-negotiable.

303
00:20:14,231 --> 00:20:15,959
- You know why?
- Authenticity.

304
00:20:16,095 --> 00:20:17,529
Correct.

305
00:20:17,665 --> 00:20:19,931
A vice cop doesn't
get to a perp's door

306
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:23,397
and then call for some hambone
stunt man to break it down.

307
00:20:23,533 --> 00:20:25,169
Neither did I.

308
00:20:25,305 --> 00:20:26,837
You gotta keep it real.

309
00:20:26,972 --> 00:20:28,852
Looks like you got a little
too real there, bud.

310
00:20:30,972 --> 00:20:32,212
Who knew it was a live grenade?

311
00:20:32,949 --> 00:20:34,148
Your name came up

312
00:20:34,283 --> 00:20:36,652
on this case I'm investigating.

313
00:20:41,354 --> 00:20:42,885
Recognize this puss?

314
00:20:45,022 --> 00:20:46,728
Never seen that chick
before in my life.

315
00:20:46,864 --> 00:20:47,923
Or afterlife.

316
00:20:52,062 --> 00:20:54,695
Any idea

317
00:20:54,831 --> 00:20:56,530
why my suspect wrote your name

318
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,396
in this schmo's goo?

319
00:20:58,532 --> 00:21:02,243
Uh... Hard to say, Wolf,
but could be a super-fan.

320
00:21:02,378 --> 00:21:03,973
You know,
guys like you and me...

321
00:21:04,108 --> 00:21:06,216
...we drive the gals crazy.

322
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,073
She collected
all her body parts.

323
00:21:08,209 --> 00:21:11,420
My hunch
is she's out for revenge.

324
00:21:11,555 --> 00:21:14,816
And you seem to be <i>numero uno</i>
on her hit list.

325
00:21:14,951 --> 00:21:16,231
Well, wouldn't be
the first woman

326
00:21:16,257 --> 00:21:17,456
who wanted to kill me.

327
00:21:17,591 --> 00:21:19,486
And kinda hard
to kill a dead guy.

328
00:21:19,622 --> 00:21:20,785
This gal can.

329
00:21:20,921 --> 00:21:22,594
She's a soul sucker.

330
00:21:22,729 --> 00:21:24,333
Oh, yeah,
you could say that again.

331
00:21:25,926 --> 00:21:28,437
My advice, lay low.

332
00:21:28,572 --> 00:21:31,330
She gets her hands on you
and you're dead-dead.

333
00:21:31,465 --> 00:21:34,270
And there's no coming back
from that, Mr. Juice.

334
00:21:34,405 --> 00:21:35,509
Roger that.

335
00:21:37,306 --> 00:21:44,147

00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,692
I just don't believe
I won't see Charles again.

346
00:22:30,828 --> 00:22:32,300
Be comforted in the knowledge

347
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:34,667
that he's in
a far better place.

348
00:22:34,803 --> 00:22:37,099
Angels are guiding him
towards everlasting light

349
00:22:37,234 --> 00:22:39,735
and may his soul fly through
the heavenly gates,

350
00:22:39,871 --> 00:22:41,673
like the birds
that he so adored

351
00:22:41,808 --> 00:22:43,441
and soar over
the Fields of Elysium

352
00:22:43,576 --> 00:22:45,172
to the glory that is thine.

353
00:22:46,146 --> 00:22:47,174
What?

354
00:22:55,251 --> 00:22:57,118
I haven't been to a funeral
since Dad's.

355
00:22:58,094 --> 00:22:59,351
Death is hard.

356
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,992
Yeah, sometimes
I think life is harder.

357
00:23:04,164 --> 00:23:05,225
I know.

358
00:23:07,231 --> 00:23:10,202
Listen, if you wanna talk
to that therapist again...

359
00:23:10,338 --> 00:23:11,338
There you go again.

360
00:23:12,405 --> 00:23:13,704
You just sidestep

361
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:15,319
every possible
conversation about him.

362
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:16,979
Astrid...

363
00:23:17,873 --> 00:23:19,411
I loved your father,

364
00:23:19,547 --> 00:23:21,712
but our relationship was over

365
00:23:21,848 --> 00:23:23,617
a long time
before the accident.

366
00:23:25,347 --> 00:23:27,187
I still don't understand
why you can't see him.

367
00:23:31,185 --> 00:23:32,791
- Why not?
- I wish I knew.

368
00:23:33,821 --> 00:23:35,187
But this ability

369
00:23:35,322 --> 00:23:37,092
didn't exactly
come with instructions.

370
00:23:38,392 --> 00:23:40,464
It all started
when I was your age.

371
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:42,294
It's ironic, isn't it?

372
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,908
You can apparently
see any random ghost

373
00:23:43,932 --> 00:23:45,431
for your shitty TV show,

374
00:23:45,566 --> 00:23:46,581
but the one ghost
that actually matters to me

375
00:23:46,605 --> 00:23:47,966
you can't see at all.

376
00:24:08,428 --> 00:24:09,795
We are closed!

377
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:12,631
I'm sorry to bother you.
My name's Charles Deetz.

378
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:14,760
I'm feeling
a little lightheaded.

379
00:24:14,895 --> 00:24:16,036
Where am I?

380
00:24:16,172 --> 00:24:17,732
Damn newbies.

381
00:24:17,868 --> 00:24:20,003
You wait! In waiting room!

382
00:24:20,969 --> 00:24:22,938
All right.

383
00:24:23,073 --> 00:24:25,140
Unbelievable.

384
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:35,489
Hey...

385
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:36,987
who's there?

386
00:25:32,306 --> 00:25:35,046
- My ex-wife is back.
- Hmm?

387
00:25:35,181 --> 00:25:37,210
Well, I know
what you're thinking...

388
00:25:37,346 --> 00:25:40,680
"When was the Juice
ever tied down?

389
00:25:40,815 --> 00:25:44,126
What kind of woman could ever
keep him satisfied?" Well...

390
00:27:30,267 --> 00:27:32,127
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

391
00:27:59,287 --> 00:28:01,119
Now she's back,

392
00:28:01,254 --> 00:28:02,390
and she's pissed.

393
00:28:32,657 --> 00:28:33,657
Hey.

394
00:28:35,722 --> 00:28:37,733
Must be pretty
noisy up here. Yeah?

395
00:28:38,995 --> 00:28:40,098
In here, too.

396
00:28:42,234 --> 00:28:44,531
Listen, if you ever
need to process

397
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:46,533
any of your emotions,
I'm here for you.

398
00:28:50,074 --> 00:28:52,771
Emotions processed. Thanks.

399
00:28:52,906 --> 00:28:55,476
I saw you standing
at your grandfather's grave.

400
00:28:57,118 --> 00:28:58,558
He must have been
a pretty dope dude.

401
00:29:01,018 --> 00:29:02,615
Death is so, like...

402
00:29:04,026 --> 00:29:07,720
It's, like, tragic,
you know?

403
00:29:07,855 --> 00:29:10,931
I mean, if you ever wanna,
you know, cry or just,

404
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:12,603
kind of rage against
some of these feelings

405
00:29:12,627 --> 00:29:14,401
that you have going on
in there,

406
00:29:14,536 --> 00:29:15,732
I want you to know

407
00:29:15,868 --> 00:29:18,036
that I could be that...

408
00:29:18,172 --> 00:29:21,139
kinda dope dad-dude for you.
You know?

409
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,679
- I'm good.
- You know,

410
00:29:24,814 --> 00:29:25,854
times like this
can bring a family

411
00:29:25,878 --> 00:29:27,910
weirdly closer together.

412
00:29:28,045 --> 00:29:29,441
On the way over here,

413
00:29:29,577 --> 00:29:31,112
I wrote a poem
for your grandpa.

414
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:33,481
Oh, did you? How does it go?

415
00:29:35,184 --> 00:29:37,258
It's, it's, it's...

416
00:29:37,393 --> 00:29:38,927
it starts...

417
00:29:39,062 --> 00:29:41,692
It, well, it kinda like
opens on grief. Obviously.

418
00:29:41,828 --> 00:29:44,460
And then acceptance.

419
00:29:44,595 --> 00:29:46,715
It's long. I didn't memorize it
or anything like that,

420
00:29:46,801 --> 00:29:48,336
but it's quite beautiful.

421
00:29:48,472 --> 00:29:50,168
Cut the crap, Rory.

422
00:29:50,304 --> 00:29:52,201
All right? I'm not falling
for your New Age,

423
00:29:52,336 --> 00:29:54,101
overly emotional,
trauma bonding,

424
00:29:54,236 --> 00:29:55,602
yoga retreat bullshit.

425
00:29:56,313 --> 00:29:57,313
I see you.

426
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,471
Because, like you,

427
00:29:59,606 --> 00:30:02,476
my mom is a very broken person.

428
00:30:02,611 --> 00:30:04,314
Okay?
She's a delusional fantasist.

429
00:30:05,478 --> 00:30:06,688
You just exploit her.

430
00:30:06,824 --> 00:30:07,961
And if she wants
to allow that to happen,

431
00:30:07,985 --> 00:30:08,989
that's on her.

432
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:20,745
I'm so sorry
for your loss. I'm sorry.

433
00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:23,133
I know, I know. Thank you.

434
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:26,307
Oh, if it isn't
little Jane Butterfield.

435
00:30:26,443 --> 00:30:27,841
Littler Jane?

436
00:30:27,977 --> 00:30:29,297
Oh, it's Jane Butterfield-Lee
now.

437
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,576
We hyphenated.

438
00:30:30,712 --> 00:30:31,712
Is that Maxie Dean?

439
00:30:33,008 --> 00:30:34,140
No.

440
00:30:34,275 --> 00:30:35,543
No one's here yet.

441
00:30:37,954 --> 00:30:39,581
Sample from
my hubby's microbrewery.

442
00:30:39,716 --> 00:30:43,088
"Micro"? Is that for people
with tiny houses?

443
00:30:43,224 --> 00:30:46,427
Why is your house
covered in black fabric?

444
00:30:46,563 --> 00:30:48,524
It's a mourning shroud.

445
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,493
Now that Charles is dead,
so also dies this house.

446
00:30:51,628 --> 00:30:54,296
And I'm protecting it
in its transition.

447
00:30:54,432 --> 00:30:57,163
To a new life
with a new family.

448
00:30:57,299 --> 00:30:58,672
I can't wait to show it.

449
00:30:58,808 --> 00:31:00,266
Buyers are already lining up.

450
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:01,999
Thanks to you, Lydia,

451
00:31:02,135 --> 00:31:04,203
everyone wants a piece
of the original Ghost House.

452
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:05,838
Ghosts aren't real.

453
00:31:05,973 --> 00:31:08,181
Only gullible people
believe that kind of crap.

454
00:31:08,316 --> 00:31:09,861
Unless you're trying to pay
the bills, right, Mom?

455
00:31:09,885 --> 00:31:11,678
Okay, honey, in we go.

456
00:31:13,221 --> 00:31:14,882
Can I have
everyone's attention, please?

457
00:31:15,017 --> 00:31:16,017
What?

458
00:31:16,055 --> 00:31:17,453
We're gathered here today

459
00:31:17,588 --> 00:31:21,024
to celebrate the life
of an extraordinary man.

460
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:22,279
Now, I only had the pleasure

461
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,889
of meeting Charles a few times.

462
00:31:24,024 --> 00:31:26,198
Then I can tell you
he didn't want any speeches.

463
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:28,898
Charles hated
public displays of emotion.

464
00:31:29,034 --> 00:31:32,202
Yeah, but he also...

465
00:31:32,338 --> 00:31:34,273
chose to live his life
to the fullest.

466
00:31:34,408 --> 00:31:37,542
I'm going to tear a page
out of Charles Deetz's book.

467
00:31:37,677 --> 00:31:39,341
Lydia,

468
00:31:39,477 --> 00:31:40,650
now, I know
we had always agreed

469
00:31:40,674 --> 00:31:41,727
to take
our relationship slowly.

470
00:31:41,751 --> 00:31:43,215
But I can't wait any longer.

471
00:31:43,351 --> 00:31:46,116
Let's get married
on your favorite holiday.

472
00:31:46,251 --> 00:31:48,119
Will you marry me on Halloween?

473
00:31:48,255 --> 00:31:49,735
- Good Lord!
- Uh...

474
00:31:50,717 --> 00:31:52,118
That's... That's in two days!

475
00:31:52,253 --> 00:31:53,587
Yes, I know.

476
00:31:53,723 --> 00:31:54,663
I've already spoken
to Father Damien.

477
00:31:54,664 --> 00:31:56,063
The church is available.

478
00:31:56,198 --> 00:31:57,504
The Lord's sanctuary
welcomes all who seek

479
00:31:57,528 --> 00:31:59,100
salvation
and everlasting glory.

480
00:31:59,236 --> 00:32:02,136
Just not before noon,
and between three and four.

481
00:32:02,271 --> 00:32:04,632
You're seriously doing this
at Charles' wake?

482
00:32:05,709 --> 00:32:08,537
Yes. Yes. Yes, because...

483
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:11,813
because as we stand here,

484
00:32:11,948 --> 00:32:13,807
surrounded by death...

485
00:32:13,942 --> 00:32:16,308
...let us all make
a commitment to choose life.

486
00:32:16,444 --> 00:32:17,743
Because I want to spend

487
00:32:17,878 --> 00:32:19,278
the rest of my life
with you, Lydia.

488
00:32:20,589 --> 00:32:21,649
And you, Delia.

489
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,986
And you too.

490
00:32:25,121 --> 00:32:26,720
And you. Again.

491
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:28,530
What do you say?

492
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:31,360
Rory, I... Come on,

493
00:32:31,496 --> 00:32:33,595
I can't commit to this
right now.

494
00:32:36,134 --> 00:32:37,731
Oh.

495
00:32:38,475 --> 00:32:39,733
All right.

496
00:32:42,738 --> 00:32:44,336
This is too much loss.

497
00:32:44,471 --> 00:32:45,704
What do you mean?

498
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,279
Well, first,
the death of Charles.

499
00:32:47,414 --> 00:32:48,919
And of course,
the death of my grandfather,

500
00:32:48,943 --> 00:32:50,703
which you know about.
And now the death of...

501
00:32:52,382 --> 00:32:54,480
- us.
- No! No, I...

502
00:32:54,615 --> 00:32:56,290
Come on, I didn't mean that.

503
00:32:56,426 --> 00:32:58,031
Thought you wanted to take
life's great big bungee jump

504
00:32:58,055 --> 00:32:59,055
right beside me.

505
00:32:59,124 --> 00:33:00,861
No safety nets, right?

506
00:33:00,996 --> 00:33:02,393
But I guess,

507
00:33:02,528 --> 00:33:04,360
the only thing
bungee jumping today is love.

508
00:33:04,496 --> 00:33:06,995
And that cord just snapped.

509
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:08,968
Come on. Rory...

510
00:33:09,103 --> 00:33:11,171
- I love you.
- And I love you.

511
00:33:13,476 --> 00:33:15,172
Oh.

512
00:33:15,307 --> 00:33:16,547
What are we waiting for?

513
00:33:18,505 --> 00:33:20,009
Okay, I guess.

514
00:33:23,443 --> 00:33:24,547
Oh, my God.

515
00:33:28,855 --> 00:33:29,855
She said "yes"!

516
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:32,990
She said "yes"!

517
00:33:34,629 --> 00:33:35,853

Sorry!

531
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:52,272
- Sorry!
- Watch out!

532
00:35:02,783 --> 00:35:03,783
Whoa.

533
00:35:06,789 --> 00:35:07,789
Are you okay?

534
00:35:15,022 --> 00:35:16,962
Are you okay?
What happened?

535
00:35:17,098 --> 00:35:19,959
Yeah. I'll live.

536
00:35:21,432 --> 00:35:22,500
Uh, what are you reading?

537
00:35:23,731 --> 00:35:25,368
<i>Crime and Punishment.</i>

538
00:35:25,503 --> 00:35:27,136
- One of those.
- "One of those"?

539
00:35:27,272 --> 00:35:28,702
What does that mean?

540
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:30,778
Nothing.
I've read it three times.

541
00:35:30,914 --> 00:35:33,181
- Did you really?
- Yeah.

542
00:35:33,316 --> 00:35:34,996
"Pain and suffering
are always inevitable."

543
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:36,079
Yes.

544
00:35:36,081 --> 00:35:37,814
Yeah, I...

545
00:35:37,949 --> 00:35:41,154
I can't believe you're quoting
Dostoevsky. That's...

546
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,751
Where have you been
all my life?

547
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,600
So, how long have
you been in Winter River?

548
00:35:49,624 --> 00:35:50,823
My whole life.

549
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:52,498
I've never seen you
around before.

550
00:35:52,633 --> 00:35:54,309
Yeah, this is just
a temporary layover

551
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:55,665
for my grandpa's funeral.

552
00:35:57,105 --> 00:35:58,503
Until my mom's janky fiance

553
00:35:58,638 --> 00:36:00,966
turned it into
a de facto engagement party.

554
00:36:01,102 --> 00:36:02,582
Yeah, he announced
their wedding date.

555
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:06,312
Wow. That's different.

556
00:36:06,448 --> 00:36:07,787
Oh, yeah.
If you knew my mom,

557
00:36:07,811 --> 00:36:09,371
that's actually
pretty on-brand for her.

558
00:36:10,517 --> 00:36:12,187
Is your dad
in the picture or...

559
00:36:13,513 --> 00:36:14,519
No.

560
00:36:15,992 --> 00:36:17,291
Yeah, he was a free spirit.

561
00:36:18,357 --> 00:36:20,028
Defender of hopeless causes.

562
00:36:20,163 --> 00:36:22,327
When they split,
he went to Brazil.

563
00:36:22,463 --> 00:36:23,903
He was trying
to save the rainforest.

564
00:36:25,462 --> 00:36:26,692
But my mom grew up here.

565
00:36:26,827 --> 00:36:28,368
That old house on the hill.

566
00:36:29,631 --> 00:36:30,733
Wait. The Ghost House?

567
00:36:31,831 --> 00:36:33,241
Is your mom Lydia Deetz?

568
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,140
Unfortunately.

569
00:36:35,206 --> 00:36:36,740
She's a legend.

570
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:38,915
Well, yeah, if you believe
in supernatural bullshit.

571
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:40,782
You don't?

572
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,008
- No.
- Mmm-hmm.

573
00:36:44,144 --> 00:36:45,704
I only believe in things
that I can see.

574
00:36:45,813 --> 00:36:47,482
You know, science. Facts.

575
00:36:50,023 --> 00:36:51,424
Oh.

576
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:53,454
Yeah, it's gonna keep going.

577
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:55,923
Back to the insanity.

578
00:36:56,058 --> 00:36:58,191
I'm sorry about your fence,
by the way.

579
00:36:58,326 --> 00:36:59,907
You can tell your parents
my mom will pay for that.

580
00:36:59,931 --> 00:37:02,127
Nah, that's okay. It's...
They won't even notice.

581
00:37:03,703 --> 00:37:07,736
Uh... Well, listen,
I'll be here tomorrow,

582
00:37:07,872 --> 00:37:11,444
if you want a break
from the insanity.

583
00:37:45,778 --> 00:37:47,217
Witness confirmed our suspect

584
00:37:47,241 --> 00:37:49,150
as the soul sucker
from Lost and Found.

585
00:37:49,286 --> 00:37:50,355
Wanna hear
the weird part, chief?

586
00:37:50,379 --> 00:37:51,714
Hit me.

587
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:52,855
After she turned the owner

588
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:54,817
into a human pancake,

589
00:37:54,953 --> 00:37:56,673
she stole a wedding dress
from the conveyor.

590
00:37:56,788 --> 00:37:59,355
Of course.
This stapled sicko...

591
00:37:59,491 --> 00:38:00,788
has her twisted heart set

592
00:38:00,924 --> 00:38:04,458
on a romantic reunion
with Mr. Juice.

593
00:38:04,594 --> 00:38:06,026
She won't stop killing,

594
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:09,029
until she walks him
back down the aisle.

595
00:38:11,267 --> 00:38:15,271
Cases like this make me wonder
why I even became a cop.

596
00:38:18,073 --> 00:38:19,743
You're not a cop.
You're an actor.

597
00:38:20,642 --> 00:38:21,646
Thank you, Janet.

598
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,143
You keep me real.

599
00:38:24,279 --> 00:38:25,525
Should we take
this Beetlejuice

600
00:38:25,549 --> 00:38:26,711
into protective custody?

601
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:28,054
See if you can find him.

602
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,549
He's probably laying low.

603
00:38:29,685 --> 00:38:31,788
Scared out of his mind.

604
00:38:37,631 --> 00:38:39,664
A little higher, boys.

605
00:38:39,799 --> 00:38:41,666
We can't let Delores
get through that door.

606
00:38:48,976 --> 00:38:50,340
Bob.

607
00:38:50,476 --> 00:38:51,511
Like lookin' in a mirror.

608
00:38:53,174 --> 00:38:55,141
You see, Bob,
you'd serve as my decoy.

609
00:38:55,276 --> 00:38:56,947
You'd walk in front of me
at all times.

610
00:38:57,083 --> 00:39:00,150
That way she'd suck your soul
while I make my getaway.

611
00:39:01,518 --> 00:39:03,022
<i>¿Comprende?</i>

612
00:39:15,432 --> 00:39:16,828
Now's my chance.

613
00:39:29,051 --> 00:39:30,448
What?

614
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:32,116
Why?

615
00:39:32,251 --> 00:39:34,614
No! No! No!

616
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,282
Delia, what's wrong?

617
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:37,999
I'm trying to capture
the perfect primal scream.

618
00:39:38,023 --> 00:39:39,669
I'm gonna blow it up,
mount it on the wall,

619
00:39:39,693 --> 00:39:41,855
and I invite all of you
to do the same.

620
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,691
- Why?
- For the Collective.

621
00:39:43,827 --> 00:39:45,730
We cannot sincerely celebrate

622
00:39:45,866 --> 00:39:48,367
all that was good
about our dearly departed.

623
00:39:48,502 --> 00:39:50,368
Not until we release the horror

624
00:39:50,503 --> 00:39:51,934
that they inflicted upon us.

625
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,365
What awful thing
did Grandpa ever do to you?

626
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,068
He bought this house
without telling me.

627
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:02,109
Oh, my God!

628
00:40:02,244 --> 00:40:03,924
I was helpfully getting
some boxes in town,

629
00:40:04,049 --> 00:40:05,658
then I heard you screaming.
Are you all right?

630
00:40:05,682 --> 00:40:07,415
It was Delia.

631
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,912
Oh, Delia.

632
00:40:09,048 --> 00:40:10,282
I'm good.

633
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:12,326
Ignore her.

634
00:40:12,462 --> 00:40:14,055
That was very
thoughtful of you.

635
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,257
Astrid, can you give him
a hand with the boxes?

636
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,810
I told the movers to come
a week from today. All right?

637
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:20,905
I think that'll give us all
time to get over

638
00:40:20,929 --> 00:40:22,593
our grief and our trauma.

639
00:40:22,729 --> 00:40:24,043
And then, after the wedding,
I think we should go back,

640
00:40:24,067 --> 00:40:25,538
and we gotta
finish those shows.

641
00:40:25,674 --> 00:40:26,975
Maybe Mom can get
the ghosts in the attic

642
00:40:26,999 --> 00:40:28,532
to give us a hand.

643
00:40:28,667 --> 00:40:31,675
Adam and Barbara Maitland.
They're not here anymore.

644
00:40:31,811 --> 00:40:33,414
Why? They find
a better house to haunt?

645
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:36,275
No, we found a loophole,
and they moved on.

646
00:40:37,118 --> 00:40:38,584
How convenient.

647
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:49,656
Ew.

648
00:42:37,501 --> 00:42:39,064
Oh.

649
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:40,938
God, I thought I lost those.

650
00:42:42,945 --> 00:42:46,909
That was taken at an all-night
Mario Bava horror fest.

651
00:42:47,045 --> 00:42:49,541
I was nine months
pregnant with you.

652
00:42:49,676 --> 00:42:52,081
My water broke during
<i>Kill, Baby... Kill!</i>

653
00:42:53,751 --> 00:42:54,922
Dad's favorite movie.

654
00:42:55,057 --> 00:42:56,057
Yeah.

655
00:42:56,158 --> 00:42:57,158
Can I keep this?

656
00:42:58,192 --> 00:42:59,792
Yeah.

657
00:42:59,927 --> 00:43:01,761
I really like that model
of Winter River, too.

658
00:43:02,727 --> 00:43:04,192
Did Grandpa make that?

659
00:43:04,328 --> 00:43:06,997
No, that belonged
to the Maitlands.

660
00:43:07,132 --> 00:43:09,637
You know,
the non-existent ghost couple.

661
00:43:18,613 --> 00:43:20,110
Oh, I found that on the floor.

662
00:43:20,245 --> 00:43:23,380
- Hey, who's Beetlejuice?
- Don't ever say that name!

663
00:43:23,515 --> 00:43:24,982
Not ever!

664
00:43:25,117 --> 00:43:27,282
- Beetlejuice.
- No! Astrid, I'm serious.

665
00:43:27,418 --> 00:43:29,787
If you say that name
three times, really bad stuff

666
00:43:29,922 --> 00:43:31,250
- is gonna happen.
- Like what?

667
00:43:31,386 --> 00:43:33,260
In fact,
this attic is off-limits.

668
00:43:33,395 --> 00:43:34,894
Do you understand me?

669
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,829
Yeah, I understand
that you're crazy.

670
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:53,339
Oh, my God, it's you!

671
00:43:53,475 --> 00:43:55,612
I thought a moose
was about to attack me.

672
00:43:55,748 --> 00:43:57,912
It's breathing exercises.

673
00:43:58,047 --> 00:43:59,654
Try seeing ghosts every day.

674
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:02,118
Astrid!

675
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,250
Let her be.

676
00:44:04,326 --> 00:44:05,851
God, she hates me.

677
00:44:07,963 --> 00:44:10,531
Somehow, Richard's
death is still my fault.

678
00:44:10,667 --> 00:44:12,462
You blamed me
for your mother's.

679
00:44:12,597 --> 00:44:14,128
She's not dead.

680
00:44:14,264 --> 00:44:17,161
And I didn't blame you.
I resented you.

681
00:44:17,296 --> 00:44:18,338
There's a difference.

682
00:44:18,473 --> 00:44:19,872
You weren't very nice.

683
00:44:20,007 --> 00:44:22,467
No, you barely acknowledged
my existence.

684
00:44:22,603 --> 00:44:24,305
But we've done all right,
haven't we?

685
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,380
Yeah. Ever since I sold out
and got famous,

686
00:44:27,515 --> 00:44:28,714
we have gotten closer.

687
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:30,509
No, I started liking you
before that.

688
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:36,849
Again with
the creepy breathing!

689
00:44:36,984 --> 00:44:38,684
It works!

690
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,868
I learned it at the survivors'
retreat, where I met Rory.

691
00:44:40,892 --> 00:44:42,257
Of course you did.

692
00:44:42,392 --> 00:44:44,193
Look, I was in shock
after Richard died.

693
00:44:44,328 --> 00:44:46,259
And I was working on
my unresolved feelings,

694
00:44:46,395 --> 00:44:48,159
and Rory had just lost
his fiancee

695
00:44:48,294 --> 00:44:49,593
in a skiing accident,

696
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:51,733
and we were
in the same sorrow circle

697
00:44:51,868 --> 00:44:53,436
and we connected.

698
00:44:53,571 --> 00:44:55,272
Yeah.

699
00:44:55,408 --> 00:44:57,622
He was turned on by you at
the lowest point in your life.

700
00:44:57,646 --> 00:44:59,370
Okay, but this isn't about him.

701
00:44:59,505 --> 00:45:01,311
Astrid found this in the attic.

702
00:45:01,447 --> 00:45:03,146
Ew. So?

703
00:45:03,713 --> 00:45:05,246
So?

704
00:45:05,382 --> 00:45:07,553
Every now and then
I feel his presence.

705
00:45:07,688 --> 00:45:09,014
Like he's lurking somewhere,

706
00:45:09,149 --> 00:45:10,586
just out of reach.

707
00:45:10,721 --> 00:45:11,886
But lately,

708
00:45:12,021 --> 00:45:13,552
I'm seeing him again.

709
00:45:13,688 --> 00:45:15,921
And I was really hoping
this was all in my head.

710
00:45:16,057 --> 00:45:17,389
But now this?

711
00:45:17,525 --> 00:45:19,458
Lydia, you need
to take back your life.

712
00:45:19,593 --> 00:45:22,461
From the hanger-onners,
from this thing.

713
00:45:22,597 --> 00:45:24,077
Where's the obnoxious
little goth girl

714
00:45:24,169 --> 00:45:26,136
who tormented me
all those years ago?

715
00:45:27,036 --> 00:45:28,699
It's time to find her.

716
00:45:43,086 --> 00:45:44,385
- Hey.
- Hey.

717
00:45:50,393 --> 00:45:52,328
- Jeremy, is that you?
- Yeah.

718
00:45:52,463 --> 00:45:54,565
Uh, Mom, I'm just gonna
be upstairs with a friend.

719
00:45:54,701 --> 00:45:55,902
Okay. Have fun.

720
00:46:00,876 --> 00:46:02,156
- Hey, Dad.
- Son.

721
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,273
Stuck on...
He lives in that room.

722
00:46:15,284 --> 00:46:17,581
You've got a lot of '90s vinyl.

723
00:46:17,717 --> 00:46:18,802
Where are you
finding this, eBay?

724
00:46:18,826 --> 00:46:21,651
No, I troll old record stores.

725
00:46:21,787 --> 00:46:23,655
I don't trust
what I can't touch.

726
00:46:29,763 --> 00:46:31,123
<i>Handbook for
the Recently Deceased.</i>

727
00:46:31,203 --> 00:46:33,402
Yeah, I got that
at a yard sale in town.

728
00:46:33,537 --> 00:46:35,976
The illustrations
are pretty gnarly.

729
00:46:36,111 --> 00:46:37,852
Yeah, looks like
the kinda crappy book

730
00:46:37,876 --> 00:46:38,876
my mom would write.

731
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:41,639
What's the deal
with your parents?

732
00:46:41,775 --> 00:46:44,078
Well, my mom spends
every waking hour

733
00:46:44,214 --> 00:46:46,787
in the kitchen stress-baking.

734
00:46:46,923 --> 00:46:49,182
And my dad used to work
at the paper mill,

735
00:46:49,317 --> 00:46:50,823
but then he had an accident,

736
00:46:50,959 --> 00:46:53,828
so now he's a full-time
couch potato.

737
00:46:53,963 --> 00:46:56,325
I can't wait to get out
of this shitty town.

738
00:46:58,264 --> 00:47:00,798
Um, you must have been
to a lot of places

739
00:47:00,934 --> 00:47:03,128
traveling, with a famous mom.

740
00:47:03,264 --> 00:47:05,035
Not really.

741
00:47:05,171 --> 00:47:06,870
My dad's
more the traveler anyway.

742
00:47:07,006 --> 00:47:08,081
We used to have this big plan

743
00:47:08,105 --> 00:47:09,436
where we were gonna visit

744
00:47:09,572 --> 00:47:11,110
the top ten
creepiest places on Earth.

745
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,311
So, Tower of London
and Dracula's Castle and...

746
00:47:14,446 --> 00:47:17,478
yeah, then we never
got the chance to do it.

747
00:47:18,278 --> 00:47:19,348
What happened?

748
00:47:20,345 --> 00:47:22,516
A boat accident.

749
00:47:22,651 --> 00:47:24,291
Yeah, they searched
the Amazon for a week,

750
00:47:24,353 --> 00:47:25,651
and they never found his body.

751
00:47:29,356 --> 00:47:30,392
You really miss him.

752
00:47:32,499 --> 00:47:33,999
Yeah.

753
00:47:34,135 --> 00:47:35,574
You know,
I at least would have liked

754
00:47:35,598 --> 00:47:37,198
to have gotten the chance
to say goodbye.

755
00:47:37,265 --> 00:47:38,537
But can't your mom,

756
00:47:38,673 --> 00:47:40,165
I don't know, like,

757
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,633
contact him or...

758
00:47:42,768 --> 00:47:44,020
She claims
she can't even see him.

759
00:47:44,044 --> 00:47:45,879
- Why not?
- Because she's a fraud.

760
00:47:46,014 --> 00:47:48,773
Well, I think
that's a little harsh.

761
00:47:50,412 --> 00:47:52,611
Uh, well, tomorrow's Halloween.

762
00:47:52,747 --> 00:47:55,855
I know. Used to be
my favorite holiday.

763
00:47:55,991 --> 00:47:57,948
Because my dad,
he would go all out

764
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,843
and make the most
age-inappropriate costumes.

765
00:47:59,929 --> 00:48:01,556
Yeah, I think I was

766
00:48:01,692 --> 00:48:03,863
in second grade when I went
as Munch's <i>The Scream.</i>

767
00:48:03,999 --> 00:48:06,692
- Wow. Yeah.
- Yeah. It was a choice.

768
00:48:06,827 --> 00:48:08,171
But now my mom's
getting married that day,

769
00:48:08,195 --> 00:48:09,429
so I don't know,

770
00:48:09,565 --> 00:48:11,165
probably be
my least favorite now.

771
00:48:11,301 --> 00:48:12,475
Well, what time's the wedding?

772
00:48:12,499 --> 00:48:14,674
Midnight. The witching hour.

773
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:16,570
Future stepdad's lame idea.

774
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:20,981
Well, why don't you
come over...

775
00:48:22,076 --> 00:48:23,082
earlier?

776
00:48:24,278 --> 00:48:25,944
Uh, we could,

777
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:30,056
I don't know, we could order
pizza and give out candy.

778
00:48:31,886 --> 00:48:34,929
Only if you want to.
I mean that's, that's no...

779
00:48:35,695 --> 00:48:36,964
no pressure.

780
00:48:40,903 --> 00:48:43,695
What is up
with these creepy birds?

781
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:45,905
Bird-watching
was my dad's passion.

782
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,936
Oh, I contacted
that vintage shop

783
00:48:48,071 --> 00:48:49,834
you love in SoHo.

784
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:52,239
They've sent a few
potential wedding dresses.

785
00:48:52,374 --> 00:48:53,942
Should be here later today.

786
00:48:54,078 --> 00:48:55,444
Ooh, great. Thanks.

787
00:48:57,145 --> 00:48:58,579
And a, uh,

788
00:48:58,714 --> 00:49:00,917
little bird may have
chirped our big news

789
00:49:01,052 --> 00:49:03,023
to a few news outlets.

790
00:49:03,158 --> 00:49:05,419
Thought we could
sell the photos exclusively.

791
00:49:05,555 --> 00:49:07,161
Could be great press
for the show.

792
00:49:07,296 --> 00:49:09,886
I... Look, I'm really excited
about tying the knot,

793
00:49:10,022 --> 00:49:13,291
but can we just keep it
small and private?

794
00:49:13,426 --> 00:49:15,733
Yeah. Well, sure.

795
00:49:15,868 --> 00:49:16,868
It's your big day.

796
00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:18,639
Night. Whatever.

797
00:49:20,903 --> 00:49:22,578
<i>Yo, I've got fevers running</i>

798
00:49:22,602 --> 00:49:24,177
<i>all through me. All through me!</i>

799
00:49:30,012 --> 00:49:31,018
Lydia?

800
00:49:32,414 --> 00:49:34,784
I want you out of my life!

801
00:49:34,919 --> 00:49:35,919
Do you hear me?

802
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:37,590
Lydia?

803
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:41,854
Who are you yelling at?

804
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:44,192
Do you remember that
couples therapist that we saw,

805
00:49:44,327 --> 00:49:45,692
- Dr. Glickman?
- Mmm.

806
00:49:45,827 --> 00:49:47,431
He said that I was holding
something back

807
00:49:47,566 --> 00:49:49,936
and until I faced it,
you and I wouldn't evolve.

808
00:49:50,072 --> 00:49:52,464
- Mmm.
- Okay, well, he was right.

809
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,805
And I'm going to tell you now.

810
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:55,974
And, fair warning,

811
00:49:56,109 --> 00:49:58,644
it's gonna sound batshit crazy.

812
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:01,042
Are you okay with that?

813
00:50:01,178 --> 00:50:02,577
Of course. I'd love to.

814
00:50:02,712 --> 00:50:04,352
Let's break through
this barrier together.

815
00:50:04,446 --> 00:50:06,152
Okay, just give me a sec.

816
00:50:10,022 --> 00:50:11,521
When I was a teenager,

817
00:50:11,656 --> 00:50:14,852
a trickster demon
terrorized my entire family

818
00:50:14,987 --> 00:50:16,559
and tried to force me
to marry him,

819
00:50:16,695 --> 00:50:19,800
in order to come back
to the real world for good.

820
00:50:19,935 --> 00:50:22,301
I believed he was gone forever,

821
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,595
and then lately,
I have been seeing him again.

822
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:27,272
And now, he is actually back.

823
00:50:27,408 --> 00:50:30,902
And I don't know why,
or how, or what to do.

824
00:50:33,581 --> 00:50:35,485
Okay, so you're saying that
someone called Beetlejuice...

825
00:50:35,509 --> 00:50:36,873
Don't say his name!

826
00:50:37,009 --> 00:50:38,815
If you say his name
three times,

827
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:40,318
he will appear.

828
00:50:42,283 --> 00:50:45,555
Okay. So this...

829
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:48,556
demon is clearly a construct
of your unpacked trauma.

830
00:50:48,692 --> 00:50:50,207
It's trauma that
you're gonna need to face,

831
00:50:50,231 --> 00:50:51,671
otherwise, it's just
gonna get worse.

832
00:50:51,794 --> 00:50:54,794
He's not a construct.
He is literally a demon.

833
00:50:56,369 --> 00:50:58,630
I know this
is a big step for you.

834
00:50:58,765 --> 00:51:00,403
But in the words
of Dr. Glickman,

835
00:51:00,538 --> 00:51:02,472
I'm gonna give you
the push you need.

836
00:51:04,906 --> 00:51:06,254
Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice,
Beetlejuice.

837
00:51:14,416 --> 00:51:15,853
What just happened?

838
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:17,355
We're in the model.

839
00:51:18,255 --> 00:51:19,583
That's not possible.

840
00:51:23,592 --> 00:51:24,755
What the hell?

841
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:26,296
I told you not to say his name!

842
00:51:30,801 --> 00:51:32,765
<i>Lydia Deetz,
ladies and gentlemen!</i>

843
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,503
<i>Don't ever
say that name.</i>

844
00:51:34,638 --> 00:51:37,234
<i>Not ever!
We need to leave, now.</i>

845
00:51:37,369 --> 00:51:39,129
<i>Beetlejuice,
Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice.</i>

846
00:51:41,742 --> 00:51:43,114
- Is that...
- Beetlejuice!

847
00:51:47,553 --> 00:51:49,284
First of all,
I want you two kids to know,

848
00:51:49,419 --> 00:51:51,156
this is a safe space. Okay?

849
00:51:51,292 --> 00:51:52,654
Feel free
to express yourselves.

850
00:51:52,789 --> 00:51:54,709
Don't be afraid. I sense
there's an enabler here,

851
00:51:54,786 --> 00:51:55,786
but we'll get to that.

852
00:51:55,896 --> 00:51:57,026
Look, dig deep

853
00:51:57,162 --> 00:51:58,162
and spill your guts.

854
00:51:58,296 --> 00:51:59,524
Okay? Who wants to go first?

855
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,096
Huh?

856
00:52:01,231 --> 00:52:02,598
All right, I will.

857
00:52:06,474 --> 00:52:08,437
There you go. See?
I'm willing to do the work.

858
00:52:08,573 --> 00:52:10,040
You two kids
need to get in touch

859
00:52:10,175 --> 00:52:11,637
with your inner child.

860
00:52:11,772 --> 00:52:13,240
Mine'll be along
in just a jiffy.

861
00:52:28,823 --> 00:52:31,055
Everybody says
he's got my eyes.

862
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,901
Personally, I don't see it.

863
00:52:34,036 --> 00:52:35,530
Scram, kid.

864
00:52:38,601 --> 00:52:39,841
You're just my unpacked trauma.

865
00:52:39,932 --> 00:52:41,338
You're just my unpacked trauma.

866
00:52:41,473 --> 00:52:43,300
You're a figment
of my imagination.

867
00:52:43,436 --> 00:52:44,771
Really?

868
00:52:44,907 --> 00:52:46,257
Is this a figment
of your imagination?

869
00:52:52,415 --> 00:52:53,952
Leg man.

870
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:55,684
Just like his old man.

871
00:53:03,229 --> 00:53:05,660
That was you stalking me.

872
00:53:05,795 --> 00:53:07,195
Hey, if stalking means

873
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:08,706
trying to remarry
the love of my life,

874
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:11,067
well, I'm guilty as charged.
Come here!

875
00:53:11,202 --> 00:53:12,767
Home, home, home!

876
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:31,721
<i>♪ Wherever you go
Whatever you do ♪</i>

877
00:53:31,857 --> 00:53:37,257
<i>♪ I will be right here
Waiting for you ♪</i>

878
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:40,725
What happened?

879
00:53:40,861 --> 00:53:42,731
I just had the wildest dream.

880
00:53:44,197 --> 00:53:46,570
Yeah, I think
we should lay off the pills.

881
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:56,507
Snakes?

882
00:53:56,642 --> 00:53:58,577
Actually, asps.

883
00:53:58,712 --> 00:54:00,119
Aren't they beautiful?

884
00:54:00,254 --> 00:54:01,651
Wedding gift for Rory?

885
00:54:01,786 --> 00:54:04,588
Too late.
They've been defanged.

886
00:54:04,723 --> 00:54:06,788
Guaranteed harmless,
and they're for me.

887
00:54:07,687 --> 00:54:08,887
In Ancient Egypt,

888
00:54:09,023 --> 00:54:10,396
a queen would perform
a ceremony

889
00:54:10,531 --> 00:54:12,262
at the tomb of her pharaoh
using snakes,

890
00:54:12,397 --> 00:54:14,399
the symbol of undying love.

891
00:54:14,534 --> 00:54:15,974
- Are you sure about that?
- Mmm-hmm.

892
00:54:16,031 --> 00:54:17,377
We read that
they were a constant threat

893
00:54:17,401 --> 00:54:18,401
to Ra in the underworld

894
00:54:18,502 --> 00:54:19,700
and represented total chaos.

895
00:54:19,835 --> 00:54:21,052
Okay, see,
that's why schools need

896
00:54:21,076 --> 00:54:22,637
more art and less reading.

897
00:54:22,773 --> 00:54:24,471
You got your wish,
we're leaving.

898
00:54:24,607 --> 00:54:25,647
So go pack up your things,

899
00:54:25,774 --> 00:54:26,925
I'm driving you back to school.

900
00:54:26,949 --> 00:54:28,247
Wait, what happened?

901
00:54:28,382 --> 00:54:30,447
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

902
00:54:30,583 --> 00:54:32,615
I will pay
for a fleet of movers

903
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,645
to take everything
back to Manhattan,

904
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,013
except that model.

905
00:54:36,149 --> 00:54:38,252
We need to chop it up
and burn it.

906
00:54:38,387 --> 00:54:39,686
Oh.

907
00:54:39,821 --> 00:54:41,785
You're calling off the wedding?

908
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:47,010
What did that
cheese ball do now?

909
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,298
It's not Rory.

910
00:54:48,433 --> 00:54:49,509
It's Beetlejuice.

911
00:54:49,533 --> 00:54:50,653
He's here.

912
00:54:50,698 --> 00:54:52,164
In the model. I saw him.

913
00:54:52,299 --> 00:54:54,339
Rory saw him, too,
but he thinks it's a dream.

914
00:54:54,474 --> 00:54:55,794
Wait,
we can't leave yet.

915
00:54:57,469 --> 00:55:00,479
I have plans tomorrow
with this boy that I met.

916
00:55:02,747 --> 00:55:04,644
How did you have time
to meet a boy?

917
00:55:04,779 --> 00:55:06,377
You had time to get married.

918
00:55:06,512 --> 00:55:08,812
She doesn't
mean it. It's just karma.

919
00:55:08,947 --> 00:55:10,179
Whatever. I was biking

920
00:55:10,315 --> 00:55:11,957
and then I kinda crashed
into his fence

921
00:55:12,093 --> 00:55:13,791
and we started talking,

922
00:55:13,927 --> 00:55:16,087
and then he invited me over
to his place for Halloween.

923
00:55:17,196 --> 00:55:18,556
Can I go, Mom?

924
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:20,094
Mmm-mmm.

925
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:21,230
Please?

926
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:26,864
I will not allow
that menace to humanity

927
00:55:26,999 --> 00:55:28,936
to upheave our family again.

928
00:55:29,072 --> 00:55:32,276
No one goes in there,
no one calls his name!

929
00:55:32,411 --> 00:55:34,139
We're gonna be fine, right?

930
00:55:34,274 --> 00:55:36,642
Mom, come on!
I'm gonna be late.

931
00:55:49,724 --> 00:55:51,321
Trick or treat!

932
00:55:55,768 --> 00:55:57,144
Are you sure
this is the right address?

933
00:55:57,168 --> 00:55:58,736
Yeah.

934
00:55:58,872 --> 00:56:00,646
125 Jefferson Lane.

935
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:02,365
Don't judge... all right?

936
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,081
His dad just got
into an accident at work,

937
00:56:04,105 --> 00:56:05,485
and they're going through
a rough patch.

938
00:56:05,509 --> 00:56:06,703
Trick or treat!

939
00:56:06,838 --> 00:56:07,843
He's cute.

940
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:10,416
What are you doing?

941
00:56:10,551 --> 00:56:11,891
I was gonna go
say "hey" to his parents.

942
00:56:11,915 --> 00:56:13,747
Seriously?
This isn't a playdate.

943
00:56:13,882 --> 00:56:14,956
I mean,
we're not six years old.

944
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:15,980
Nothing's gonna happen.

945
00:56:16,082 --> 00:56:18,117
All right, okay. You're right.

946
00:56:18,252 --> 00:56:21,257
Have fun,
and I'll pick you up at 10:00.

947
00:56:21,393 --> 00:56:22,693
Not a second later.

948
00:56:26,729 --> 00:56:27,731
Come on, quick!

949
00:56:30,238 --> 00:56:31,405
Trick or treat!

950
00:56:49,524 --> 00:56:52,149
I, uh,
raided the basement.

951
00:56:52,285 --> 00:56:54,457
I forgot we even
had half this stuff.

952
00:56:54,593 --> 00:56:55,793
Yeah, you really went all out.

953
00:56:55,854 --> 00:56:57,563
Yeah.

954
00:56:57,698 --> 00:56:59,559
I like the James Dean costume,
by the way.

955
00:56:59,695 --> 00:57:00,728
Thank you. But yeah,

956
00:57:00,863 --> 00:57:02,365
my parents think
I look more like

957
00:57:02,501 --> 00:57:04,128
Richie from <i>Happy Days.</i>

958
00:57:04,264 --> 00:57:06,231
- Mmm?
- Your costume looks great.

959
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:08,941
Who are you supposed to be?

960
00:57:09,076 --> 00:57:10,103
Marie Curie.

961
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,921
Two-time Nobel Prize-winning
French physicist

962
00:57:13,945 --> 00:57:15,578
- and feminist icon.
- Oh, she was, uh,

963
00:57:15,714 --> 00:57:17,907
she discovered radiation.
Right?

964
00:57:18,043 --> 00:57:19,186
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

965
00:57:19,321 --> 00:57:20,396
Yeah, her work was killing her.

966
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:21,618
She didn't even realize it.

967
00:57:21,754 --> 00:57:23,682
Yeah, well,
for someone who is dying

968
00:57:23,818 --> 00:57:25,915
of radiation poisoning,

969
00:57:26,051 --> 00:57:29,496
uh, you look beautiful.

970
00:57:29,631 --> 00:57:33,091
I brought some candy.
Or a lot of... I...

971
00:57:33,227 --> 00:57:34,563
It's probably
too much actually.

972
00:57:34,699 --> 00:57:36,229
But, uh, we can, I don't know,

973
00:57:36,364 --> 00:57:38,284
maybe binge on whatever's
left over, if you want?

974
00:57:38,365 --> 00:57:40,302
Or we could start
handing it out now,

975
00:57:40,437 --> 00:57:41,834
if that's...

976
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:43,508
- what you wanna do.
- Yeah.

977
00:57:43,643 --> 00:57:46,271
Uh, I have a confession, actually.

978
00:57:47,779 --> 00:57:50,781
I'd rather stay up here
with you.

979
00:57:54,253 --> 00:57:56,281
Okay. Yeah.

980
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:58,223
That works, too.

981
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:32,651
Please don't freak out.

982
00:58:32,787 --> 00:58:33,791
What are you?

983
00:58:34,755 --> 00:58:35,755
Don't you know?

984
00:58:37,622 --> 00:58:39,863
Astrid, really,
you don't have to be scared.

985
00:58:41,828 --> 00:58:43,064
You're a ghost.

986
00:58:47,136 --> 00:58:48,738
My mom was telling the truth.
Shit!

987
00:58:48,873 --> 00:58:50,334
When my mom and dad
used to fight,

988
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:52,071
I used to steal
one of my dad's six-packs

989
00:58:52,206 --> 00:58:54,112
and go hide out
in the tree fort.

990
00:58:54,247 --> 00:58:55,247
And one day,

991
00:58:56,810 --> 00:58:57,810
I slipped

992
00:58:57,877 --> 00:58:58,882
and fell.

993
00:59:00,312 --> 00:59:01,472
How long ago did that happen?

994
00:59:01,555 --> 00:59:03,716
23 years, 5 months and 14 days.

995
00:59:03,852 --> 00:59:05,317
But who's counting?

996
00:59:05,453 --> 00:59:06,802
I've been stuck in this house
for 23 years.

997
00:59:06,826 --> 00:59:09,587
I can't go any further
than that tree.

998
00:59:09,723 --> 00:59:12,824
And I've just spent my time
watching the world go by.

999
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,431
But then you came along,

1000
00:59:14,566 --> 00:59:15,767
and you could see me.

1001
00:59:17,837 --> 00:59:19,364
And I've been on my own
for so long,

1002
00:59:19,499 --> 00:59:21,568
it was like a grenade
had gone off in my head.

1003
00:59:21,703 --> 00:59:22,774
It was amazing.

1004
00:59:23,573 --> 00:59:24,641
You're amazing.

1005
00:59:24,776 --> 00:59:26,376
- I should go.
- Astrid, I know.

1006
00:59:26,512 --> 00:59:27,741
I know it's insane.

1007
00:59:27,876 --> 00:59:31,009
But I really like you,

1008
00:59:31,145 --> 00:59:32,784
and I want us to be together.

1009
00:59:34,187 --> 00:59:35,755
How?

1010
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:38,119
You're dead, I'm alive.
That doesn't make any sense.

1011
00:59:39,259 --> 00:59:40,621
Well, uh,

1012
00:59:40,756 --> 00:59:42,451
what if I told you

1013
00:59:42,587 --> 00:59:44,257
that I'd found a way
to come back.

1014
00:59:45,893 --> 00:59:47,266
To be human again.

1015
00:59:47,402 --> 00:59:49,394
Um, it's all in this book.

1016
00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:51,290
Uh, everyone gets one of these
when they die.

1017
00:59:51,406 --> 00:59:52,568
It's kind of complicated,

1018
00:59:52,704 --> 00:59:54,837
but, uh, I can only do it

1019
00:59:54,973 --> 00:59:58,645
with the help
of a living person.

1020
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:01,714
And you could literally
give me my life back.

1021
01:00:01,849 --> 01:00:04,378
I don't know.
Maybe we could ask my mom?

1022
01:00:04,514 --> 01:00:06,910
'Cause she's supposed to be
the undead expert, right?

1023
01:00:07,045 --> 01:00:08,445
Yeah, well, I...

1024
01:00:08,581 --> 01:00:10,980
I'm sure she'll give you
a million reasons

1025
01:00:11,116 --> 01:00:12,483
to stay away.

1026
01:00:12,618 --> 01:00:14,320
But I'll give you one reason
to help me.

1027
01:00:16,288 --> 01:00:18,522
You'd get to see your dad.

1028
01:00:19,397 --> 01:00:20,397
Again.

1029
01:00:34,906 --> 01:00:36,789
I have the first
official open house

1030
01:00:36,813 --> 01:00:38,245
a week from Sunday,

1031
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:40,060
and then we will let
the bidding war begin.

1032
01:00:40,145 --> 01:00:41,351
Where's Rory?

1033
01:00:41,486 --> 01:00:43,020
Supermarket.

1034
01:00:43,155 --> 01:00:45,115
Swapping out the candy
I bought for carrot sticks.

1035
01:00:45,222 --> 01:00:47,456
Because Rory loves
to fun-suck everything.

1036
01:00:47,591 --> 01:00:48,792
Even Halloween.

1037
01:00:48,928 --> 01:00:51,390
Gotta run.
See you at the church.

1038
01:00:51,525 --> 01:00:54,199
Oh. Unless you're calling off
the wedding?

1039
01:00:54,334 --> 01:00:55,334
No, Delia.

1040
01:00:56,261 --> 01:00:57,261
Where are you going?

1041
01:00:57,370 --> 01:00:58,738
Cemetery.

1042
01:00:58,873 --> 01:01:00,872
To commune
with my dear husband's spirit.

1043
01:01:03,071 --> 01:01:04,837
I need to skedaddle, too.

1044
01:01:04,972 --> 01:01:06,545
I'm co-chaperoning

1045
01:01:06,681 --> 01:01:09,179
Littler Jane's
Girl Scout troop.

1046
01:01:09,314 --> 01:01:11,515
We spent weeks coming up
with a group costume theme.

1047
01:01:11,651 --> 01:01:14,543
We agreed nothing Disney.

1048
01:01:14,679 --> 01:01:16,383
The closest
we ever got to Disney

1049
01:01:16,518 --> 01:01:20,321
was when Astrid dressed
as Cinderella's dead mom.

1050
01:01:20,456 --> 01:01:22,266
You'll never guess
what the girls came up with.

1051
01:01:22,290 --> 01:01:24,593
- Mmm?
- Fruit salad.

1052
01:01:24,728 --> 01:01:26,060
Isn't that genius?

1053
01:01:26,196 --> 01:01:28,064
It's healthy
and non-triggering.

1054
01:01:28,962 --> 01:01:29,962
I'm going as...

1055
01:01:32,638 --> 01:01:34,498
"reverse mortgage."

1056
01:01:34,634 --> 01:01:36,501
Which is "mortgage"
spelled backwards.

1057
01:01:37,773 --> 01:01:39,169
Where is Astrid?

1058
01:01:39,304 --> 01:01:41,647
On a date. Her first.

1059
01:01:41,783 --> 01:01:44,078
I think I'm more nervous
than she is.

1060
01:01:44,214 --> 01:01:45,747
The boy lives over
on Jefferson.

1061
01:01:45,883 --> 01:01:47,916
Don't mention that street.

1062
01:01:48,051 --> 01:01:49,126
I have a listing that's kept me

1063
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:51,181
from a perfect sales record.

1064
01:01:51,316 --> 01:01:53,056
Oh, it's my own fault.

1065
01:01:53,192 --> 01:01:55,521
The place had been
on the market for years...

1066
01:01:55,657 --> 01:01:58,026
but I thought if I could sell
the "Murder House,"

1067
01:01:58,162 --> 01:01:59,528
it would be
a feather in my cap.

1068
01:01:59,664 --> 01:02:00,767
Murder House?

1069
01:02:01,434 --> 01:02:02,434
Which house?

1070
01:02:03,534 --> 01:02:05,264
125.

1071
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,035
That's where
I dropped Astrid off.

1072
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:08,731
She was seeing
a boy named Jeremy.

1073
01:02:08,867 --> 01:02:11,840
Jeremy Frazier?

1074
01:02:11,975 --> 01:02:13,945
I didn't get his last name.

1075
01:02:15,043 --> 01:02:16,715
Oh, no, it can't be him.

1076
01:02:16,851 --> 01:02:19,885
But Jeremy Frazier
was bad news.

1077
01:02:20,021 --> 01:02:23,284
Twenty-three years ago,
he murdered his parents.

1078
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:25,283
The cops found him
hiding in his tree house.

1079
01:02:25,418 --> 01:02:26,503
When they tried to get him out,

1080
01:02:26,527 --> 01:02:28,392
he fell, broke his neck,

1081
01:02:28,527 --> 01:02:30,095
died instantly.

1082
01:02:35,564 --> 01:02:38,031
That's all you have to do
to get into the Afterlife?

1083
01:02:38,166 --> 01:02:40,263
Draw a door with some chalk?

1084
01:02:40,399 --> 01:02:41,708
Oh, and knock three times?

1085
01:02:41,843 --> 01:02:43,154
I'm just doing
what it says in there.

1086
01:02:43,178 --> 01:02:44,178
So lame.

1087
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:56,790
Or maybe it's not so lame.

1088
01:02:56,925 --> 01:02:58,681
And what do we do?
We just walk through?

1089
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:00,617
I can. But since
you're still alive,

1090
01:03:00,752 --> 01:03:02,928
you have to read
that incantation first.

1091
01:03:05,256 --> 01:03:08,829
<i>"De mundo
vivorum audeo in iterum..."</i>

1092
01:03:25,683 --> 01:03:26,683
Astrid!

1093
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:34,218
Jeremy, is that you?

1094
01:03:40,297 --> 01:03:43,133
<i>"Ut liber iterum
ambulet alius."</i>

1095
01:03:44,569 --> 01:03:45,932
Okay.

1096
01:03:46,068 --> 01:03:47,599
I think that worked.

1097
01:03:48,309 --> 01:03:49,370
Astrid!

1098
01:03:52,844 --> 01:03:53,847
Let's go see your dad.

1099
01:03:57,277 --> 01:03:59,149
Astrid! No!

1100
01:04:05,557 --> 01:04:06,557
Okay.

1101
01:04:17,497 --> 01:04:19,632
Uh, okay, you just wait here.

1102
01:04:19,768 --> 01:04:21,905
I'm gonna go find out
where we're supposed to go.

1103
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:24,471
Make sure to ask
where my dad is.

1104
01:04:24,606 --> 01:04:26,605
Excuse me,
sorry, sorry for...

1105
01:04:28,309 --> 01:04:29,372
Merry Christmas.

1106
01:04:29,508 --> 01:04:30,741
Merry Christmas.

1107
01:04:32,310 --> 01:04:33,544
Thanks.

1108
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,218
Okay, we need to go
to Immigration.

1109
01:04:42,396 --> 01:04:45,229
Excuse me, can I
please speak to your manager?

1110
01:04:45,365 --> 01:04:48,331
My wife is gonna flay me
if I don't get home soon.

1111
01:04:48,466 --> 01:04:50,563
That's sweet.
Take a number and a seat.

1112
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:58,201
Whoa, dude.

1113
01:05:02,841 --> 01:05:05,150
Oh,
Powers of the Hereafter,

1114
01:05:05,285 --> 01:05:09,384
accept my Charles as
I have accepted his passing.

1115
01:05:10,085 --> 01:05:11,589
No, I haven't.

1116
01:05:11,724 --> 01:05:13,617
And I won't ever.

1117
01:05:13,752 --> 01:05:15,753
There is no expiry date
on sorrow.

1118
01:05:17,027 --> 01:05:19,262
Oh. Oh, that's good.

1119
01:05:19,397 --> 01:05:23,029
Though there is no expiry date
on sorrow!

1120
01:05:23,164 --> 01:05:24,734
Kings of Commerce,

1121
01:05:24,869 --> 01:05:26,236
Knights of Nasdaq,

1122
01:05:26,371 --> 01:05:30,499
deem him worthy to enter
the gates of your realm.

1123
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:33,077
You are no more, my king.

1124
01:05:33,212 --> 01:05:35,277
But with the blessing
of the angels

1125
01:05:35,413 --> 01:05:37,016
of undying love...

1126
01:05:37,949 --> 01:05:40,678
I, your surviving queen,

1127
01:05:40,813 --> 01:05:42,953
proudly take up the mantle
of your...

1128
01:05:48,458 --> 01:05:50,458
Okay.
There you go. Thank you.

1129
01:05:52,023 --> 01:05:53,823
You all right, honey?
You look a little manic.

1130
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:55,232
Just pre-wedding jitters.

1131
01:05:55,367 --> 01:05:57,063
I'm just gonna go up
and try on my dress,

1132
01:05:57,198 --> 01:05:58,764
but don't come up

1133
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:00,417
'cause it's bad luck to see me
before the ceremony.

1134
01:06:00,441 --> 01:06:01,441
Sure.

1135
01:06:03,737 --> 01:06:06,102
Oh, well, hello.
Who's clowning around?

1136
01:06:06,237 --> 01:06:08,151
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!

1137
01:06:08,175 --> 01:06:09,475
Here we are.

1138
01:06:09,611 --> 01:06:10,971
- Apples...
- Thank you!

1139
01:06:11,086 --> 01:06:12,952
...carrot sticks,
and some blonde raisins,

1140
01:06:13,088 --> 01:06:14,528
'cause no one likes
a big, fat clown.

1141
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:19,993
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1142
01:06:21,459 --> 01:06:23,594
Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice,
Beetlejuice.

1143
01:06:53,288 --> 01:06:55,292
The Juice is loose.

1144
01:06:57,792 --> 01:06:59,242
I need you to tell me
what this means.

1145
01:06:59,266 --> 01:07:01,759
Oh, well, let's have a look,
shall we?

1146
01:07:01,895 --> 01:07:04,202
Long story short,
your daughter's screwed.

1147
01:07:04,337 --> 01:07:06,265
She decided to trade lives
with the boy.

1148
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,932
He gets to come back,

1149
01:07:08,067 --> 01:07:09,548
while she's stuck
on the other side permanently.

1150
01:07:09,572 --> 01:07:11,338
One-way ticket
on the Soul Train.

1151
01:07:11,473 --> 01:07:12,668
- Soul Train?
- That's right.

1152
01:07:12,803 --> 01:07:15,178
Last stop, the Great Beyond.

1153
01:07:15,314 --> 01:07:16,875
No, she can't
get on that train.

1154
01:07:17,011 --> 01:07:18,696
You've gotta get me in there
so I can get her out.

1155
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,084
Well, I can get you in,

1156
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:22,318
but it's gonna
take a quid pro quo.

1157
01:07:22,454 --> 01:07:24,518
Of course there is.
What do you want?

1158
01:07:24,654 --> 01:07:26,392
Well, I've got this ex-wife,
you know?

1159
01:07:26,527 --> 01:07:28,772
And she's kind of a whack job,
first of all. We're through.

1160
01:07:28,796 --> 01:07:30,428
She's kinda clingy.

1161
01:07:30,564 --> 01:07:31,600
If I could just get away
from her permanently somehow.

1162
01:07:31,624 --> 01:07:32,929
You want me to marry you!

1163
01:07:33,065 --> 01:07:34,563
I thought you'd never ask.

1164
01:07:34,698 --> 01:07:36,409
How do I know that
you're gonna keep your word?

1165
01:07:36,433 --> 01:07:38,129
I swear
on my dead mother's soul.

1166
01:07:38,264 --> 01:07:39,567
Yikes!

1167
01:07:41,708 --> 01:07:43,242
Okay, fine.

1168
01:07:43,377 --> 01:07:45,217
I'll marry you if you help me
save my daughter.

1169
01:07:45,276 --> 01:07:46,516
I'm gonna need that in writing.

1170
01:07:46,573 --> 01:07:48,074
- Give me that.
- Ow.

1171
01:07:48,209 --> 01:07:49,214
And here we go.

1172
01:07:52,249 --> 01:07:53,613
I'm gonna make you so happy.

1173
01:07:53,748 --> 01:07:56,280
Jesus! What's the plan
on getting in?

1174
01:08:02,761 --> 01:08:03,888
Yeah.

1175
01:08:06,026 --> 01:08:08,431
Well, can't exactly
go through the front door.

1176
01:08:20,909 --> 01:08:23,073
<i>We need
a demon possession.</i>

1182
01:08:36,258 --> 01:08:37,262
You never saw us.

01:08:38,062 --> 01:08:39,062
<i>¿Comprende?</i>

1184
01:08:40,564 --> 01:08:43,035
Bob, you and the boys

01:08:43,171 --> 01:08:44,863
Nobody gets through.

1186
01:08:46,905 --> 01:08:47,905
Let's go, honey.

1187
01:09:08,153 --> 01:09:09,729
- Trick or treat.
- Trick or treat.

1188
01:09:09,753 --> 01:09:11,157
Whoa, whoa.

1189
01:09:11,292 --> 01:09:12,455
One each.

01:09:13,791 --> 01:09:15,359
Yeah, right. Asshole.

1192
01:09:16,929 --> 01:09:18,462
Huh?

1193
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:23,604
Okay, everyone,

1194
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:24,886
strawberries get first pick
this time.

1195
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:26,771
No crowding.

1196

Hands on your head, asswipe!

1197
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,591
Or I'll spray-paint the wall

Oh, no, dude.

01:09:46,362 --> 01:09:47,733
That was way too forced.

1201

Remember, throw it away.

1202
01:09:50,068 --> 01:09:51,829
Underplay it.

1203

01:09:56,506 --> 01:09:59,041
We got a code 6-9-9 violation.

1207

<i>...6-9-9 violation.</i>

Time to call the Ghoul Squad.

01:10:10,117 --> 01:10:13,593
I need a hard target search
for two suspects.

Excuse me!

1230

What if a mistake's been made?

1231
01:11:08,074 --> 01:11:10,046
Because I'm not
supposed to be here.

1232
01:11:16,615 --> 01:11:17,746
Seriously?

1233
01:11:17,882 --> 01:11:20,453
No. I have global entry.

1234
01:11:20,589 --> 01:11:22,585

1295
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:32,336
I don't know.

1296
01:15:35,139 --> 01:15:36,978
Hey, that's Saturn.

1297
01:15:37,113 --> 01:15:40,013
Right? So we must be
on one of its moons.

1298
01:15:40,148 --> 01:15:41,818
I swear,
the Afterlife is so random!

1299
01:16:03,672 --> 01:16:05,908
Sandworm! Run!

1300
01:16:14,013 --> 01:16:15,548
Take my hand!

1301
01:16:22,186 --> 01:16:23,354
Here! Come on!

1302
01:16:52,951 --> 01:16:54,425
Marie Curie.

1303
01:16:54,561 --> 01:16:56,522
After the radiation poisoning.

1304
01:16:56,657 --> 01:16:58,092
Right?

1305
01:16:58,227 --> 01:16:59,987
Learned from the best.

1306
01:17:00,961 --> 01:17:02,129
We made a great kid.

1307
01:17:02,995 --> 01:17:05,000
Yeah, we did.

1308
01:17:06,668 --> 01:17:07,673
Come here!

1309
01:17:11,004 --> 01:17:12,370
I know you can't see me,

1310
01:17:12,505 --> 01:17:15,271
but I check in on you both
all the time.

1311
01:17:15,406 --> 01:17:16,591
And I don't want
to be the reason

1312
01:17:16,615 --> 01:17:18,315
that drove you two apart.

1313
01:17:18,451 --> 01:17:19,451
You need each other.

1314
01:17:20,586 --> 01:17:22,116
You make each other better.

1315
01:17:23,113 --> 01:17:24,151
Always have.

1316
01:17:25,650 --> 01:17:26,965
<i>Alert!</i>

1317
01:17:26,989 --> 01:17:28,252
<i>We have a 6-9-9 violation.</i>

1318
01:17:28,388 --> 01:17:30,092
We gotta get back
to Winter River.

1319
01:17:30,227 --> 01:17:32,072
You can't leave until
Astrid gets her life back.

1320
01:17:32,096 --> 01:17:34,623
<i>- Warning! Intruder detected!</i>
- Let's go.

1321
01:17:36,332 --> 01:17:39,430
The Ghoul patrol found
the breach and sealed it.

1322
01:17:39,565 --> 01:17:42,602
Any sign of Mr. Beetlejuice?
Or the Fleshbag?

1323
01:17:42,738 --> 01:17:44,138
Still looking.

1324
01:17:44,273 --> 01:17:45,913
But we did find something
that might help.

1325
01:17:58,554 --> 01:18:00,022
Hmm.

1326
01:18:08,467 --> 01:18:10,065
- "Bob"?
- Mmm?

1327
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:14,707
Let me tell ya
how this is gonna go.

1328
01:18:14,842 --> 01:18:17,742
Your shriveled lips
will start flappin',

1329
01:18:17,877 --> 01:18:19,938
or I'll crack
your itty-bitty skull

1330
01:18:20,073 --> 01:18:21,941
like a goddamn walnut.

1331
01:18:22,076 --> 01:18:23,280
Where's Beetlejuice?

1332
01:18:38,456 --> 01:18:39,931
- Rory?
- Father...

1333
01:18:40,066 --> 01:18:42,058
I'm seeing these shrunken
head people everywhere.

1334
01:18:42,194 --> 01:18:43,701
Well, be not afraid,

1335
01:18:43,837 --> 01:18:45,835
for thine eyes
will see strange things.

1336
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:47,703
Are you filled
with fear and trembling?

1337
01:18:47,838 --> 01:18:50,268
Yes! I'm shitting my pants.

1338
01:18:50,403 --> 01:18:52,369
- Ah.
- What are you doing here?

1339
01:18:52,505 --> 01:18:53,689
I'm searching
for the lost lambs

1340
01:18:53,713 --> 01:18:55,076
to bring back into the light.

1341
01:18:55,212 --> 01:18:57,541
Why don't I give you a ride
to the church?

1342
01:19:03,886 --> 01:19:05,923
Trick or treat!

1343
01:19:07,419 --> 01:19:08,989
Sorry, sorry I just... I'll...

1344
01:19:09,124 --> 01:19:10,460
I... Come right back, I just...

1345
01:19:10,595 --> 01:19:12,226
Excuse me. Just...

1346
01:19:12,361 --> 01:19:15,427
Um, sorry, I'm just, uh,
late for a wedding.

1347
01:19:15,563 --> 01:19:17,966
Hi, yes, one question,
how do I get out of here?

1348
01:19:18,102 --> 01:19:19,608
Because someone
made a terrible mistake.

1349
01:19:19,632 --> 01:19:21,933
I'm on a break.
Take a number. Take a seat.

1350
01:19:22,069 --> 01:19:23,468
No, you see, those asps,

1351
01:19:23,603 --> 01:19:24,917
they were defanged.
I paid extra for that.

1352
01:19:24,941 --> 01:19:26,941
Honey, you're dead, okay?

1353
01:19:27,076 --> 01:19:28,979
Now take a number and sit down.

1354
01:19:32,516 --> 01:19:36,821
Is there perhaps anyone here
who has the power to help me?

1355
01:19:36,956 --> 01:19:38,388
Did that line
used to work for you?

1356
01:19:38,524 --> 01:19:40,322
I'm not dead!

1357
01:19:42,121 --> 01:19:43,321
You know what?

1358
01:19:43,457 --> 01:19:44,990
My husband's here.
Charles Deetz.

1359
01:19:45,125 --> 01:19:46,723
Yes, he can fix this.

1360
01:19:46,859 --> 01:19:48,038
You call him, he can fix this,
he can fix anything.

1361
01:19:48,062 --> 01:19:49,567
Not anymore he can't.

1362
01:19:49,703 --> 01:19:52,101
No, wait! Wait, I know people!

1363
01:19:52,236 --> 01:19:55,632
Oh! I know people!
I am people! Why's...

1364
01:19:57,409 --> 01:19:58,838
No.

1365
01:19:58,974 --> 01:20:00,846
Beetlejuice. Oh, no.

1366
01:20:03,815 --> 01:20:05,543
Beetlejuice.

1367
01:20:07,446 --> 01:20:08,950
Right here.

1368
01:20:09,085 --> 01:20:10,819
I get it. Now that you're dead,

1369
01:20:10,954 --> 01:20:12,517
you wanna hang out with me.

1370
01:20:12,652 --> 01:20:14,216
Would you help me
find Charles, please?

1371
01:20:14,352 --> 01:20:16,185
And then the VIP lounge.

1372
01:20:16,321 --> 01:20:17,786
- Sure.
- Okay.

1373
01:20:17,922 --> 01:20:20,459
Just after you help me
find my runaway bride.

1374
01:20:22,501 --> 01:20:23,567
Ugh.

1375
01:20:33,571 --> 01:20:35,276
Hmm?

1376
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:38,844
Where is he?

1377
01:20:41,618 --> 01:20:43,453
Tell me.

1378
01:21:14,585 --> 01:21:17,417
<i>Stay behind
the line until called.</i>

1379
01:21:24,093 --> 01:21:25,293
Don't stamp that passport!

1380
01:21:29,603 --> 01:21:32,068
You're too late, man.

1381
01:21:32,204 --> 01:21:33,829
I think it was Dostoevsky
who said...

1382
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:36,640
"Later, fucker!"

1383
01:21:40,009 --> 01:21:41,412
This way. Follow me.

1384
01:21:46,212 --> 01:21:48,350
Next!

1385
01:21:48,486 --> 01:21:51,253
<i>Warning! Intruder detected.</i>

1386
01:21:52,318 --> 01:21:54,050
This way.

1387
01:21:54,185 --> 01:21:56,358
<i>This is
a code 6-9-9. We have...</i>

1388
01:21:56,493 --> 01:21:58,333
Okay, this is as far as I go.

1389
01:21:59,062 --> 01:22:00,599
- Okay.
- I love you.

1390
01:22:00,734 --> 01:22:02,066
I love you too, sweetheart.

1391
01:22:03,362 --> 01:22:05,296
Have an amazing life.

1392
01:22:05,431 --> 01:22:06,568
You take care of each other.

1393
01:22:06,703 --> 01:22:07,904
Yeah.

1394
01:22:08,039 --> 01:22:09,403
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

1395
01:22:31,491 --> 01:22:32,965
Thank you for saving my life.

1396
01:22:35,402 --> 01:22:39,169
I'm so sorry I never believed
that you saw ghosts and...

1397
01:22:39,305 --> 01:22:40,985
I don't know,
I'm just sorry for all of it.

1398
01:22:43,644 --> 01:22:44,942
Astrid, I...

1399
01:22:45,078 --> 01:22:46,907
Lydia!
Come on, you're late!

1400
01:22:47,043 --> 01:22:48,570
Oh, my God! My wedding!

1401
01:22:48,706 --> 01:22:50,181
We're about to start.

1402
01:22:50,316 --> 01:22:51,952
Wait, Mom, with everything
that's happened tonight,

1403
01:22:51,976 --> 01:22:53,358
you know you don't
have to do this, right?

1404
01:22:53,382 --> 01:22:54,982
I know,
but if I don't do it now,

1405
01:22:55,117 --> 01:22:57,117
I'm never gonna do it.

1406
01:22:57,252 --> 01:22:59,124
But are you sure about this?

1407
01:22:59,259 --> 01:23:02,686
Rory loves me,
and that's gotta be enough.

1408
01:23:02,822 --> 01:23:04,592
Quickly, my dear!
Come! Come!

1409
01:23:04,728 --> 01:23:05,822
Oh.

1410
01:23:08,994 --> 01:23:10,143
And the lost lamb
is welcome into thy house

1411
01:23:10,167 --> 01:23:11,795
- with open arms.
- Oh, my God!

1412
01:23:13,763 --> 01:23:14,968
I thought you got cold feet.

1413
01:23:15,103 --> 01:23:16,403
Oh, no, blame me.

1414
01:23:16,539 --> 01:23:18,139
She just saved me
from my date from hell.

1415
01:23:18,207 --> 01:23:19,471
Who are all these people?

1416
01:23:19,607 --> 01:23:21,473
This is just
a couple influencers.

1417
01:23:21,609 --> 01:23:23,181
Nobody under
five million followers,

1418
01:23:23,317 --> 01:23:25,549
and I think we have
a Netflix executive in there.

1419
01:23:25,685 --> 01:23:26,750
We doing this?

1420
01:23:26,886 --> 01:23:28,645
Yeah. Where's your dress?

1421
01:23:28,781 --> 01:23:30,265
All that matters
is that I'm here, now.

1422
01:23:30,289 --> 01:23:31,849
So let's just skip
straight to the vows.

1423
01:23:31,956 --> 01:23:33,155
Wait, where's Delia?

1424
01:23:33,291 --> 01:23:34,464
Yo!

1425
01:23:34,488 --> 01:23:36,821
Right here.

1426
01:23:36,956 --> 01:23:38,468
She was helpin' me calm down
before the wedding.

1427
01:23:38,492 --> 01:23:39,897
I was feeling a little jittery.

1428
01:23:40,033 --> 01:23:42,133
- All, right, beat it.
- You.

1429
01:23:43,330 --> 01:23:44,634
You're that thing...

1430
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:46,201
from my dream.

1431
01:23:46,337 --> 01:23:48,132
Well, I'm really
more nightmare material,

1432
01:23:48,267 --> 01:23:49,701
but, thanks.

1433
01:23:49,837 --> 01:23:51,637
- You're...
- Uh-uh.

1434
01:23:52,271 --> 01:23:53,572
Part of the deal

1435
01:23:53,708 --> 01:23:55,184
is you can never,
ever say my name, ever!

1436
01:23:55,208 --> 01:23:56,539
What deal?

1437
01:23:56,675 --> 01:23:57,905
The deal she made to save you.

1438
01:23:58,041 --> 01:23:59,321
By the way,
you can call me "Dad."

1439
01:23:59,345 --> 01:24:00,684
Lydia.

1440
01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:02,746
You agreed to marry him?

1441
01:24:02,882 --> 01:24:06,054
I was desperate,
and it was my only option.

1442
01:24:06,189 --> 01:24:07,554
Lydia. What's going on here?

1443
01:24:08,994 --> 01:24:10,757
Wow.

1444
01:24:10,893 --> 01:24:12,692
Awkward.

1445
01:24:12,828 --> 01:24:14,837
You haven't made much progress
since our last session,

1446
01:24:14,861 --> 01:24:17,399
so I'm gonna suggest
some drug therapy.

1447
01:24:17,535 --> 01:24:19,867
Don't be afraid to share.
When you're ready.

1448
01:24:26,213 --> 01:24:28,312
I always thought
your whole act was bullshit.

1449
01:24:28,447 --> 01:24:30,780
I never believed in ghosts,
spirits, or any of it.

1450
01:24:30,916 --> 01:24:32,974
What? All this time?

1451
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:35,149
Why the hell
did you wanna get married?

1452
01:24:35,285 --> 01:24:36,548
Money!

1453
01:24:36,684 --> 01:24:37,934
I knew I could make more
as your husband

1454
01:24:37,958 --> 01:24:39,322
than I could as your manager.

1455
01:24:39,457 --> 01:24:42,523
And I never
had a dead fiancee.

1456
01:24:42,658 --> 01:24:44,229
I just went
to that survivor's retreat,

1457
01:24:44,364 --> 01:24:47,056
so that I could meet
weak women and exploit them!

1458
01:24:47,191 --> 01:24:50,265
And I hit the codependent
lottery when I met you.

1459
01:24:50,401 --> 01:24:52,104
How 'bout a little
physical therapy?

1460
01:25:00,375 --> 01:25:01,740
We'd like to thank you all

1461
01:25:01,875 --> 01:25:03,610
for coming to this
very special occasion,

1462
01:25:03,745 --> 01:25:06,146
but right now
we'd like a little privacy.

1463
01:25:32,472 --> 01:25:34,174
Where you goin', <i>Padre?</i>

1464

one more surprise,

01:25:45,652 --> 01:25:46,852

Mr. Juice,

1506
01:30:08,716 --> 01:30:10,748
you've violated code 6-9-9!

1507
01:30:10,883 --> 01:30:12,248
Freeze!

1508
01:30:13,850 --> 01:30:14,885
Book 'em, Danno!

1509
01:30:17,095 --> 01:30:18,595
Beetlejuice!

1510
01:30:22,058 --> 01:30:24,135
What the...

1511
01:30:24,271 --> 01:30:25,569
I'm back.

1512
01:30:30,537 --> 01:30:31,932
Sweetheart!

1513
01:30:32,068 --> 01:30:33,306
You look fantastic!

1514
01:30:33,442 --> 01:30:35,139
You look so...

1515
01:30:35,274 --> 01:30:37,612
- put together.
- He's mine.

1516
01:30:37,748 --> 01:30:39,913
It's me, not you.
You know, honey,

1517
01:30:40,048 --> 01:30:42,519
I've been goin' through
a lotta changes lately.

1518
01:30:42,654 --> 01:30:44,420
Kind of a mid-afterlife
crisis, I guess.

1519
01:30:44,555 --> 01:30:47,650
Your soul belongs to me,
my love.

1520
01:30:47,786 --> 01:30:49,519
For eternity.

1521
01:30:49,654 --> 01:30:50,973
You don't wanna
spend your eternity with me.

1522
01:30:50,997 --> 01:30:52,095
I'm a lone wolf.

1523
01:30:52,231 --> 01:30:53,663
You need a soulmate.

1524
01:30:53,799 --> 01:30:56,501
Somebody who really sees you.
For instance.

1525
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:05,070
I need something
to draw with. Quick!

1526
01:31:39,036 --> 01:31:40,142
<i>Olé.</i>

1527
01:31:52,283 --> 01:31:53,690
- Let's go!
- Hey!

1528
01:31:54,622 --> 01:31:56,326
We had a deal.

1529
01:31:56,462 --> 01:31:57,992
She doesn't have to marry you.

1530
01:31:58,127 --> 01:31:59,962
- What?
- You violated code 6-9-9.

1531
01:32:00,098 --> 01:32:02,557
Yeah, you illegally brought
my mom into the Afterlife.

1532
01:32:02,692 --> 01:32:05,031
According to that book,
that contract is null and void.

1533
01:32:08,699 --> 01:32:11,174
Look, I'm sorry things didn't
work out between us,

1534
01:32:11,310 --> 01:32:13,475
but the 600-year age gap

1535
01:32:13,611 --> 01:32:15,212
was a little bit much for me.

1536
01:32:15,347 --> 01:32:16,644
- Beetle...
- Ah!

1537
01:32:16,779 --> 01:32:18,209
Beetlejuice.

1538
01:32:22,847 --> 01:32:23,847
Beetlejuice.

1539
01:32:31,422 --> 01:32:32,964
- Hey!
- Beetlejuice.

1540
01:32:43,443 --> 01:32:45,071
Shoulda got married in Vegas.

1541
01:32:53,510 --> 01:32:54,982
Looks like
we're a little late, boys.

1542
01:32:57,087 --> 01:32:59,181
Tape off the crime scene,
call in forensics,

1543
01:32:59,317 --> 01:33:01,956
and keep
the goddamn media away.

1544
01:33:02,091 --> 01:33:05,228
Little lady, you just
popped his Beetlejuice.

1545
01:33:05,363 --> 01:33:06,696
Say your goodbyes,

1546
01:33:06,832 --> 01:33:08,594
you can take a selfie now,
if you like,

1547
01:33:08,729 --> 01:33:09,964
but make it quick.

1548
01:33:11,768 --> 01:33:13,469
Sister, you're comin' with me.

1549
01:33:13,605 --> 01:33:15,403
What? Delia, what did you do?

1550
01:33:15,538 --> 01:33:16,904
I fell for a scam,

1551
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:19,777
and I'm counting on you
to claim a refund.

1552
01:33:19,912 --> 01:33:21,580
Those snakes were actually
poisonous, weren't they?

1553
01:33:21,604 --> 01:33:24,812
Yeah. So, I died
of embarrassment.

1554
01:33:24,947 --> 01:33:27,046
Your work's gonna
go up in value.

1555
01:33:27,182 --> 01:33:28,782
- Oh! Oh, well, then.
- Mmm-hmm.

1556
01:33:29,451 --> 01:33:30,916
Delia...

1557
01:33:31,051 --> 01:33:32,580
- I'll miss you.
- No, you won't.

1558
01:33:32,716 --> 01:33:34,622
I'll find Charles
and we'll haunt you both,

1559
01:33:34,757 --> 01:33:36,660
until you beg us to move on!

1560
01:33:36,795 --> 01:33:38,762
Nice work
for a couple of Fleshbags.

1561
01:33:38,897 --> 01:33:40,661
Don't come knockin'
until it's your time,

1562
01:33:40,797 --> 01:33:42,529
and in the meantime, remember,

1563
01:33:42,665 --> 01:33:44,366
you gotta keep it real.

1564
01:33:44,502 --> 01:33:45,801
Come on, beautiful,

1565
01:33:45,936 --> 01:33:47,837
we got a date
with the commissioner.

1566
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:34,752
Charles!

1567
01:34:36,519 --> 01:34:37,689
Delia!

1568
01:34:40,053 --> 01:34:41,385
I can't believe you're here!

1569
01:34:44,362 --> 01:34:45,596
Oh, Charles.

1570
01:34:45,732 --> 01:34:47,424
I'm so happy
to see you!

1571
01:34:48,333 --> 01:34:49,597
Oh, Charles,

1572
01:34:49,733 --> 01:34:50,999
look what happened to me!

1573
01:34:53,669 --> 01:34:55,734
This is the 10:13,

1574

1577

over the years,

but this is my last show.

1580
01:35:20,527 --> 01:35:24,028
I have spent so much time
talking to the dead,

1581
01:35:24,163 --> 01:35:26,232
it's time I started living.
