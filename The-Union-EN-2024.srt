1
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:29,339
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to Trieste, Italy.

2
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:32,258
Looks like we've got a storm rolling in
off the Adriatic

3
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:37,430
and a missing CIA agent in room 620
of the Grand Hotel Castelletto.

4
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,516
This is London HQ.

5
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,476
We got a live feed up and running,

6
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,936
<i>and we are good to go.</i>

7
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,647
This is Faraday.
Pickup crew on the sixth floor.

8
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,108
- Agent Hall, you have the field.
<i>- Copy that, boss.</i>

9
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,568
<i>Pickup team, give the signal
when you're in position.</i>

10
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:54,739
Forty-five seconds. I wanna be in and out.
Vehicle team, be ready to move.

11
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:55,823
<i>In position.</i>

12
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:58,493
Remember, I want
this piece of shit alive, Brennan.

13
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:01,871
Yeah. What is he,
a ringer on your CIA softball team?

14
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,123
In position.

15
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,707
Try not to shoot the guy.

16
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,001
You wanna pick up the tab
for his minibar too?

17
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:10,255
Yeah, yeah. Get a receipt.
I'm sure Langley will reimburse.

18
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,966
<i>Okay, everybody. Stand by.</i>

19
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,262
Faraday, ready to breach.

20
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,113
- On your knees!
- On the ground!

21
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,057
<i>Area's secure.</i>

22
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,268
- Please don't shoot!
- Contact to target.

23
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,352
<i>Clear!</i>

24
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,900
Hog-tied and ready to ride.

25
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,990
Confirmed. We have the hard drive.

26
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:37,907
Go for extraction.

27
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,621
I changed my mind.

28
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,124
I was gonna go to the embassy
and hand myself in.

29
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,918
Well, good news. We saved you a trip.

30
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,712
<i>Traveling on the stairwell.</i>

31
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,464
- Heads up, Rayner, they're coming to you.
- Copy that.

32
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,263
Five seconds until the exit.

33
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,770
Get down!

34
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,732
What the hell happened?

35
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,902
Rayner's down! Exit's compromised!
Go out the back.

36
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,278
Copy that.

37
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,572
What's going on?!

38
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:18,655
Let's move!

39
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,909
What's our play?

40
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:26,789
- Backup extraction point at the canal!
- Better not lose that intel, Brennan.

41
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,583
Just...

42
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,732
- He's hit!
- Glover's gone!

43
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,275
<i>- Call for backup!
- Who is it?</i>

44
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,383
We're taking fire!

45
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,220
Hold your position.
I can get ground support in five minutes.

46
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,281
- We can get to the canal in three.
<i>- You'll be in the open.</i>

47
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,985
Seriously, Rox.
You gotta trust me on this.

48
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,769
Okay. Green light.

49
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,332
<i>- Go!</i>
- Let's move! Come on!

50
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,231
- Get him outta here!
- On me!

51
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,111
<i>Oh my God! Please!</i>

52
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,739
<i>Faraday, do you copy?
Nick, do you copy?</i>

53
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,950
<i>Does anybody copy? Anybody?</i>

54
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,762
- Faraday, what's your location?
<i>- Nick, where are you?</i>

55
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,052
<i>I'm at the extraction point.
I have the asset.</i>

56
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:54,585
<i>...time to go over to Dan
for today's outlook right across Jersey.</i>

57
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,921
<i>Thank you, Mitch. I'm Dan Farrell...</i>

58
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,926
- Shit.
- I've made you coffee.

59
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,635
Thank you.

60
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,262
It's to go.

61
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,516
Are you kicking me out?

62
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:11,477
I'm too old for small talk
in the morning, Michael.

63
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,732
Last night was fun,
but... it ain't last night no more.

64
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,943
Goddamn, Nicole. That's cold.

65
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:27,410
Hey. When we first met,
did you ever think we'd hook up?

66
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:32,290
Uh, I was your seventh grade
English teacher, Mike. So... no.

67
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,875
You always passed me.

68
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:35,584
Hey.

69
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:39,756
Look at you. You're still educating me
all these years later.

70
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,845
I'll see you around, huh?

71
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,972
I imagine so!

72
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,103
- Hey, Gary.
- Mike.

73
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,398
- Hey, Ma.
- Hey, honey.

74
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,235
That's a really nice suit.
You still working uptown?

75
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,655
- Gary works at the bank.
- Like as a teller?

76
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:05,823
Like as a manager.

77
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:06,907
Oh.

78
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,160

Not in Jersey.

86
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,987
Is her Gary still working at the bank?

87
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,199
No, they fired him. He's selling hot dogs

A few weeks.

00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:57,083
No, I need to know the exact date.
I have to make my appointments.

- For the right nail tech.

I don't want them to stick me with Josie.

<i>Ms.</i> Hoffman, if you don't mind.
And, yes, I did. Twice.

110
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,037
- Wow.
- One and a half times at least.

111
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,705
I don't remember her from school.

112
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:20,333
If you didn't cut class every day,
maybe you'd remember.

00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,137
Hey, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no. I got this.

119
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,014
How, brother? You're as broke as me.

120
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,892
First, nobody's as broke as you.
You can barely pay attention.

121
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:41,521
And secondly, I got an advance today,
so it's all good.

122
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,897
- Thanks, Mike.
- Yeah.

123
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,316
- All right. I gotta drain the hog!
- You do that.

124
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,485
I didn't know you got an advance.
Good for you.

125
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:50,821
What is this guy, dumb <i>and</i> ugly?
There's no advance. I'm broke as shit.

126
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:54,325
Billy's out of work. We'll split this.
Come on. Break out the lunch money.

127

<i>Gotta be honest, Rox.
Not sure why this is our man.</i>

128
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,248
I got a good feeling about him, boss.

129
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:04,168
If he's anything like that guy I remember,
he's exactly who we need.

130
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,046
- Hey, Jimmy. I need another.
- Sure thing, Mike.

Hiya, Mikey.

134
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,606
Roxanne Hall. What are you doing here?

135
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,359
What does it look like I'm doing here?
I'm getting a drink!

136
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,405
- So, what, you're here by yourself?
- Yeah.

137
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,950
- Uh...
- No.

138
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,033
Date night?

139
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:41,247
I'm sorry. It's just...
it's just this is such a surprise, is all.

140
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,375
What's a surprise to me is you still got
the same haircut since high school.

141
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,043
Hey, hey, don't knock Supercuts.

142
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,392
- Two shots, please.
- You got it.

143
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,857
- You can handle your liquor now?
- I always handled my liquor.

144
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,175
I got a vomit-stained tuxedo
that says different, but...

145
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,179
Wait, you still got your tuxedo
from high school?

146
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,345
- Yeah.
- Really?

147
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,555
And it still fits.

148
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,056
Ah.

149
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,142
This is so crazy.

150
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:04,437
I mean, I just... I pictured you walking
through that door a thousand times.

151
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,646
Is it as you imagined?

152
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,749
In my head,
you were always wearing a bikini, but...

153
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,362
Do you still breakdance
outside the rec center?

154
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,741
Every Saturday. And you know what?
The girls still love it too.

155
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,909
I don't remember any girls lovin' it.

156
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,888
- What about Isabella Mingarelli?
- She only liked you 'cause I liked you.

157
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,707
- You know this.
- No, she liked my moves. You know, that...

158
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,339
Oh my God.
She has six kids with Matty Museo.

159
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,216
- And another one on the way.
- What about you?

160
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,485
- What about me?
- You got kids?

161
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,845
Do I have kids?
No, I don't have any... Do you?

162
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,805
Well, I don't know. None that I know of.

163
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,853
Looks like
you're losing your touch.

164
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:48,189
I forgot how good
these disco fries actually were.

165
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:51,359
You forgot about a lot of good things
when you went off to college.

166
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,444
I guess Paterson didn't suit you, huh?

167
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,823
- I don't think college did either.
- I heard about that.

168
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:58,907
Yeah?

169
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,118
What'd you hear?

170
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:05,331
You got into a fight with the point guard
of the basketball team before the finals.

171
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,916
Broke his jaw. Got kicked out.

172
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,211
Well, actually, he was the center,
and I broke his nose.

173
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,172
Well, you can take the girl out of Jersey.

174
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:16,759
No, no, no. Wait. What happened was
he took my best friend on a date.

175
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,636
She couldn't remember a thing
in the morning.

176
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:22,390
People at school didn't care,
so... what happened happened.

177
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,392
So you threw away your college career?

178
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,017
Nope.

179
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:27,602
Traded it in.

180
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,229
For what?

181
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,192
For doing the right thing.

182
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,654
What do you say we... call it a night?

183
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,408
What? No, we're just having fun.
You don't wanna finish the game?

184
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,326
I didn't say end the night, Mike.

185
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,494
I mean let's

186
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,247
take it somewhere else.

187
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,207
Oh.

188
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,172
Oh shit!

189
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,175
Whoa!

190
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,761
If I'd known we were gonna do
the Gumball Rally,

191
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,179
I'd have had less disco fries!

192
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,355
Wow, look at this place.

193
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,316
Remember that bench right there?

194
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,423
Where you first told me you loved me.

195
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:20,322
I was always trying to do
romantic stuff like that.

196
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,075
I'd do anything to make you smile.

197
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,623
Oh! I got... I gotta take this.
If it wasn't important...

198
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,418
- Mike.
- It's gonna take one second. One second.

199
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,129
Hang on.

200
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,007
Just one second.

201
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,012
- Oh no!
- Come on. You loved this song.

202
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,138
No, don't sing it.

203

205
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,983
- How did I fall for this?
- Oh, you were young and dumb.

206
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:56,984
I wasn't dumb.

207
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,152
- Naive.
- Yeah.

208
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,820
- Naive.
- Naive.

209
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:00,904
Yeah.

210
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,449
God, I wish you hadn't left like you did.

211
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,951
- Sh-sh-sh! No, don't talk about that.
- All right.

212
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,953
Don't mess this up, Mikey. Come on.

213
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,330
- This is good.
- I'm sorry.

Hmm.

218
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,306
I did have an ulterior motive
for bringing you here.

219
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,643
Oh yeah? You tryin'
to whisk me away with you, huh?

220
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:38,108
Yeah, something like that.

221
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,280

227
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,831
Morning.

228
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,333
Welcome to London, Mikey.

229
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,295
Rox, what the hell?
Where... where did Jersey go?

230
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,922
Oh, it didn't go anywhere. You did.

231
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,506
What?

232
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,802
No, no, no. We were... we were at the Point.

233
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:50,639
Remember I was being very charming?
"Jersey Girl" was playing...

234
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,933
And then I injected you
with a tranquilizer

235
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,895
and transported you here
via freight to the UK.

236
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,939
No, no. I should be at work.

237
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:02,109
I can't... I can't be late again.
My foreman's gonna kill me.

238
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,380
Hell of a wake-up call, huh, Mike?

239
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,717
- Who are you?
- Tom Brennan.

240
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,177
Local 12-25.

241
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,595
- What?
- I'm Roxanne's boss.

242
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,889
Although, sometimes,
it does not feel like that.

243
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,724
I'm a diligent follower of orders, boss.

244
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:36,268
Yeah, just not always the ones I'm giving.

245
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,020
What kind of think tank is this?

246
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:41,357
Think tank. That's good.
I usually tell people I'm a pilot.

247
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,067
He's got the hat and everything.

248
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,903
- What?
- Let me buy you breakfast. You drive.

249
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,237
Rox, what...

250
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:52,242
- I need some answers.
- Okay, what do you wanna know?

251
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,119
What do you mean? Am I being kidnapped?

252
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,246
One way you can tell
if you're being kidnapped

253
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,084
is if a guy tosses you the keys
to a $200,000 sport utility vehicle

254
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,086
and offers to buy you breakfast.

255
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,758
I normally jimmy this shit
with a screwdriver.

256
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:10,761
- Where... There's no place to put the key.
- Mike.

257
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,347
Right there.

258
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,560
Somebody needs to tell me
what the hell is going on.

259
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,771
Will do, Mike. Take a right.

260
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,865
You might wanna try
driving on the right side.

261
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,568
Oh shit! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Shit!

262
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,278
What the...

263
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,020
- The hell is he doing?
- The right side is the left side.

264
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,743
Do you know how confusing you sound?

265
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,620
- First time in London?
- What do <i>you</i> think?

266
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,206
His first time
out of the tristate area.

267
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,293
So you don't work
for an international think tank?

268
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,504
Nope. We work for the Union.

269
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,422
What union?

270
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,882
Half the intelligence community
don't know we exist.

271
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:52,177
- The other half regret finding out.
- You guys the FBI or something?

272
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,013
Yeah, except <i>we</i> do all the work,

273
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,682
and we don't wear coats
with our name in big yellow letters.

274
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,892
That sounds exciting for you,
but why am I here?

275
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,061
Because two nights ago, in Trieste, Italy,

276
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:04,648
a Union mission
to intercept a CIA turncoat went south.

277
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,543
- That's why I'm in London?
- Yep.

278
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,401
Basically.

279
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:11,321
I'm sorry for being a little slow here,
but you have to fill in the blanks, okay?

280
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,323
Tell you what makes the Union unique.

281
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,451
We don't recruit
out of Princeton or Harvard.

282
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:19,705
We're not looking to tap the Yale skulls
or the Oxford tennis team.

283
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,041
We're looking for people
that fly under the radar.

284
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,460
An invisible army
that keeps the world running.

285
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:28,047
People who do the actual work.
Street smarts over book smarts.

286
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,424
Blue collar, not blue blood.

287
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:33,719
People that build our cities,
keep production lines humming.

288
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,847
That's who <i>we</i> are... and we get shit done.

289
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,516
People like us
are expected to get shit done

290
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,269
'cause nobody ever handed us
anything a day in our lives.

291
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,229
What he said.

292
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:50,194
Hey, Maggie. We'll have three bacon rolls
and three black coffees for takeaway.

293
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,570
Ketchup or brown sauce?

294
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,155
Just ketchup, thank you.

295
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,741
- What the hell is a brown sauce?
- I have no idea.

296
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,619
Those guys over there, they work for you?

297
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,782
If they did,
you wouldn't have noticed 'em.

298
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,541
So look here. This is Derek Mitchell.
Former CIA analyst.

299
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,543
He was on the run
with top secret information.

300
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,504
- Guy you were tryin' to get in Trieste?
- Yep.

301
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,467
- Yeah, Trieste.
- Except you guys messed it up.

302
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,008
Yeah, we messed it up.

303
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,012
Now Mitchell has a hole
where his face used to be,

304
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,848
the intel is in the wind,
and we are up shit creek.

305
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,267
Know what they call that?

306
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:26,271
I don't know.
Space Needle? Harry Potter Wand?

307
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,108
The BT Tower.
You know what the Union call it?

308
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:31,735
Home.

309
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,117
Look in here, Mike.

310
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,163
How did they get all of my shit like that?

311
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,665
Check this out.

312
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,835
Juliet Quinn, AKA the Auctioneer.

313
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,546
We found out she's selling the intel
on the black market in London

314
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,881
on behalf of a mystery seller.

315
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,802
The mystery seller being whoever killed
your guys and stole the intel.

316
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,304
Those are the kind of details
you're gonna have to remember

317
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,764
if you wanna pass the test.

318
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,641
- What test?
- The entrance test.

319
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:03,642
I don't like tests.

320
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,688
- Same thing?
- Yeah.

321
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,189
Wow! Holy shit!

322
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,233
Whoa.

323
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:16,697
In two weeks, that stolen intel's
gonna be sold at a black market auction

324
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,615
that we need to be a part of.

325
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:22,119
- That's where <i>you</i> come in.
- Hey, Athena.

326
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,163
What's he talking about, where <i>I</i> come in?

327
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,166
- Any underlying medical issues?
- Not that I know of.

328
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,501
Are you on any medications presently?

329
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,961
I got tranquilized last night.

330
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,524
- I don't know if that counts.
- Nope.

331
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,215
Hey, what did you mean by
"that's where I come in"?

332
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,261
That intel Mitchell stole
wasn't launch codes or blueprints

333
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,846
for some secret missile base.

334
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:44,725
It was... information
about every man and woman

335
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,561
who has ever served
a Western-allied country.

336
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,356
Every local cop,
every rifleman in the marines.

337
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,069
Every spook at MI5, MI6... FBI, CIA,

338
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,905
and, yeah, the Union.

339
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,990
That intel gets into the wrong hands,

340
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,701
our ability to protect the public
is history.

341
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,913
Here's the rub, Mike.
We need somebody clean.

342
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,373
If I send in somebody
that could turn up as Miss July

343
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,752
on the FBI's
most promising agents calendar this year,

344
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,464
they're gonna get their head blown off,
and the mission is DOA.

345
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,884
So we need somebody with no history.

346
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,303
Basically, we need a nobody.

347
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,429
Correct.

348
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,096
After you.

349
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,726
Hey, what's up, big man?

350
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,937
Oh, what the... Rox, what the hell?

351
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,147
- You're a tough guy, huh?
- What? Hey!

352
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,357
Yeah, that's right.

353
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,733
- Bro. What?
- What's up, man?

354
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:37,819
Let me see how tough you are now.
Too pretty to be a tough guy.

355
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,505
Don't let the pretty face fool you.
I'm from the street.

356
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:43,283
Yeah? Which street is that?
Sesame Street?

357
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:49,456
- Keep the new guy in one piece.
- There you go. Oh, you want some more?

358
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,667
Come on at me, Elmo.
Let's see what you got.

359
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,043
Hey, hey, hey!

360
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,546
Yeah, I can work with this.

361
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,091
This is Frank Pfeiffer,
physical specialist.

362
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,927
You were about to say you're not sure
if you're the guy for this,

363
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,971
and honestly, I think that's a good sign.

364
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:07,641
I'm not sure either,
but Roxanne believes you can do it, so...

365
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,270
You got till the end of the day
to make up your mind, okay?

366
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:20,279
You need a nobody, huh?
Why don't you get one of these people?

367
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,949
- I didn't mean that, Mike.
- No, you meant a nobody in a good way.

368
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,912
I mean, just yesterday, I'm waking up
next to Nicole Hoffman in Paterson.

369
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,622
I hadn't thought about you in forever.

370
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,500
Today, I'm in London, and you're asking me
to risk my life for you?

371
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,211
- None of this makes any sense.
- Wait. Let me get this straight.

372
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,714
You had sex
with our seventh grade English teacher?

373
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,842
- That is not the point, Roxanne.
- What <i>is</i> the point, Mike?

374
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,511
Why me? You haven't seen me in 25 years.

375
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:48,181
A guy who can be on a tiny beam
a thousand feet in the air

376
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:51,184
and keep his cool,
who used to be an all-star athlete.

377
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,437
A guy I remembered I could count on.

378
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,023
But I'm supposed to count on you.
You dropped out of my life.

379
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,942
I went to college!
Let's not make this thing overly dramatic.

380
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,902
No, no. You disappeared.

381
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,487
That was the Union. That wasn't me.

382
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,906
I didn't know that.
How was I supposed to know that?

383
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,783
I'm sorry.

384
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,495
We're not asking you
for a lifetime commitment here.

385
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,748
It's one operation. That's it.

386
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:25,594
Look, first-class ticket to Newark,
leaves tonight.

387
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,804
You could be back
in Wilson's bar tomorrow.

388
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:31,141
Same bar, same stool, same friends.
Your choice.

389
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,705
Oh!

390
00:22:58,752 --> 00:22:59,836
Roxanne Hall?

391
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,714
Wait. Wa... Ma, how do you know that?

392
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,257
<i>- I know everything.</i>
- Look.

393
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,676
<i>I know you must be worried,
but I can explain.</i>

394
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,470
I always liked her for you.

395
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,597
<i>She's pretty and smart.</i>

396
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,642
Comes from a good family. Ambitious.

397
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,685
<i>- What is she up to?</i>
- Nothing, okay? Can I...

398
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,020
<i>Are you coming home?</i>

399
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:21,942
<i>Ah, the look on your face is telling me
that the answer is no!</i>

400
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,737
And, yes,
I can hear the look on your face.

401
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,114
I'm your mother.

402
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,616
Oh my God, Ma.
They should've recruited you.

403
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:32,327
<i>All right. Listen, I gotta go, Mikey.</i>

404
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,954
Give Roxanne a hug from me,

405
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:37,249
and don't leave your best man speech
till the last minute.

406
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,209
Wait. Ma, I...

407
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,813
Thanks, man.

408
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:06,735
I'm in.

409
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,197
Just call me the Jersey James Bond.

410
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,657
Double O "Go fuck yourself"?

411
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,325
Exactly.

412
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,829
Normally, we'd put you through
a six-month training program

413
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,748
of everything you need to know
to be a Union agent,

414
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,542
<i>but, unfortunately,
we only have two weeks.</i>

415
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,794
<i>So we're gonna have to do
the best we can, Mike.</i>

416
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,131
- Any allergies?
- Nope.

417
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,257
Any phobias?

418
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,342
Heights? Spiders?

419
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,844
- Commitment?
- Nope.

420
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,512
How many fingers can fit in your anus?

421
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,307
- All right, stop.
- I'm doing a psychological profile on you.

422
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,517
What does my asshole
have to do with psychology?

423
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,269
Hmm. You should read Freud.

424
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,789
What's your relationship like
with your father?

425
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,983
Well, he's dead now,
so, you know, we argue a lot less.

426
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:49,905
Shit!

427
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,410
Mike, this is, uh... You know what?
Doesn't matter what his name is.

428
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,288
- We just call him Foreman.
- Why do they call you Foreman?

429
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,582
- 'Cause I used to be one.
- That makes sense.

430
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:04,085
Drove a forklift for an Amazon
distribution center in Fort Worth.

431
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,505
Cleared 10,000 packages an hour.

432
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:09,090
Then I reprogrammed
their entire computer system.

433
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,594
Doubled their productivity, made half
their management level redundant.

434
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,847
Wow. Well, thank you
for sharing your story with me.

435
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,766
Sprint to the edge of this building.

436
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,685
If you stop before I tell you to stop,
you fail.

437
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,521
You slow down, you fail.

438
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,773
You take this off, you fail.

439
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,692
If you let me run off the edge
and fall to my death, do I fail?

440
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,776
You do.

441
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:34,783
This is just like the go-karts in Jersey.
Oh, I got this shit.

442
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:40,914
The shit's on the wrong side.

443
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:43,625
They don't have go-karts
with the wheel on this side.

444
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:44,543
Mike, go again.

445
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,503
Okay, this is a memory and reflex test.

446
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:50,215
I'm gonna read out a series of numbers,
and I want you to repeat them back to me.

447
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,132
Okay.

448
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:55,136
One, seven, nineteen,
eight, five, three, ten.

449
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,013
One, seven, nine...

450
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,098
Ow! Jesus!

451
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,684
Reflex bad. Can you finish the numbers?

452
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,352
No, I think I forgot.

453
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:03,979
Okay. Memory bad.

454
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,941
Reflex still bad.

455
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,024
Go!

456
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:14,072
- Fail!
- Damn it!

457
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,865
It's about trust, Mike.

458
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:19,035
{\an8}This guy's about to take a swing at you.
What you doin' wrong?

459
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,329
{\an8}I shouldn't have been
talking to his girlfriend.

460
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,169
- Shit.
- Put your hands.

616
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,366
Mike, where are you?

617
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:03,119
Shit. I'm running!
This place is like a damn labyrinth!

618
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,042
Yeah!

619
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,043
Oh shit.

620
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:14,922
Oh God. All right, I'm okay.

621
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,846
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Miss! Miss, hey!

622
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,476
You gotta be kidding. What...

623
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,439
Hey! Help!

624
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,701
Rox, watch out!

625
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:44,886
Holy shit.

626
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,858
Come on, come on. Let's go, let's go.

627
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,323
Let's roll.

628
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,793
Shit.

629
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,300
I'm sorry.

630
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,267
Hey.

631
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:35,479
- It's totally busted.
- You can't get anything from it?

632
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,316
Well, the microchip,
the iOS, it's just totally fried.

633
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,569
It's like somebody fell on it
and dropped it in a sink or somethin'.

634
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,071
- So go tell him.
- No, you tell him.

635
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,240
- You tell him.
- You go tell him.

636
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,659
Yeah. They had these, boss.

637
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,579
- Makarovs. So Russians, right?
- Yep.

638
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,496
Thanks, man.

639
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,833
My guess is Moscow is tracking
everybody else in this auction.

640
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,753
Easier to kill the opposition
than outbid 'em.

641
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:03,299
Let me tell you something, man.
My first day in the field...

642
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,426
...I got my ass kicked too.

643
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:07,135
Yeah?

644
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:08,637
Not by a woman.

645
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:14,685
Not that there's anything wrong with that,
you understand... Just clarifying.

646
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,105
You know what? I think we got a leak.

647
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,023
Think about it.

648
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:22,026
First Trieste, now this.

649
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,652
We don't have a leak.

650
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,446
I trust everybody in this room.

651
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,906
As far as what happened today,

652
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:29,367
there's at least five other groups
in this thing.

653
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,161
They'd all do whatever the hell it takes
to get that intel.

654
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:35,498
So we gotta assume it's open season
on everybody in this auction.

655
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:36,874
We ain't in the auction.

656
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:39,627
I mean, not anymore,
not without a working device, so...

657
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,338
Okay, but look.
There's five other groups, right?

658
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:45,216
So that means
there's five other devices out there.

659
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:49,678
So if we can't fix ours,
then... why don't we steal another one?

660
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,931
I mean, would that work?

661
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,014
In theory.

662
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:54,517
Possibly.

663
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,727
The security of the Western world
depends on it,

664
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,063
not to mention the future
of this organization,

665
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,816
so I guess "in theory, possibly"
is gonna have to do.

666
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,403
The auction takes place
in less than 48 hours.

667
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,738
Let's all go home and get some rest, huh?

668
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,281
Rox, can I have a word?

669
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:18,791
Seems serious.

670
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,837
Ronnie's wedding.

671
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:26,757
I'm the best man. I'm supposed to be
planning a bachelor party.

672
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,593
Real-life stuff, huh?

673
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:31,762
So are you gonna jab me again?

674
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,015
Come on, Mike.

675
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,977
I know why we're here.
Brennan wants you to send me home, right?

676
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:40,521
Yeah. Well, you're not wrong.

677
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,816
Maybe it's better you just go home.
Stay alive.

678
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,486
Seriously, you took a chance on me,
and it didn't work out,

679
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,280
but I don't like
letting other people down.

680
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:52,533
You did good. You did everything
you were supposed to do.

681
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:55,161
The mission just fell apart.
Not your fault.

682
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:58,289
I just wanna see it through
to prove you didn't make a mistake.

683
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,584
- Really?
- Yeah.

684
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,878
You gonna give me another chance?

685
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:10,759
- Could we have two tequilas, please?
- Coming up.

686
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:13,554
He's not gonna
slip me anything, is he?

687
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,975
Let's drink to it. To second chances.

688
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:24,607
Intelligence gathering indicates
the other groups in the auction represent

689
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:28,068
China, North Korea,
Syria, Russia, and Iceland.

690
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,237
Iceland?

691
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,281
Just kidding. It's Iran. It's always Iran.

692
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:33,949
Who can we get to?

693
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:37,536
None of them are gonna be easy,
but hired muscle is like anything else.

694
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:41,415
You get what you pay for,
and North Korea... pays shit.

695
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:46,420
Oh. Well, they don't look very Korean.
I would know because I'm Korean.

696
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,173
Very astute, Athena.
They are, in fact, not Korean.

697
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,966
They are very Eastern European.

698
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,469
Former Soviet Bloc mercenaries
is what they are.

699
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:56,388
Our comms unit triangulated a signal,
and, uh,

700
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:59,600
they are holed up
in this vacant mansion in Hampstead.

701
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,363
Foreman, I need you on the ground today.
We're gonna steal a device.

702
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:06,357
Let's be sure it's actually the right one.
Roxanne, Frank, you're with Foreman.

703
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,900
Athena, you got recon.

704
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,652
Mike, since you're still here,

705
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,946
I'm guessing Roxanne
didn't listen to me again.

706
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:13,905
Rox.

707
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:16,449
He can handle it.

708
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:19,411
All right, Mike.
Your lucky day. Let's move out.

709
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,337
Surveillance in position.

710
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,922
<i>You are clear to go.</i>

711
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:52,361
<i>♪ Some people tell me
I'm a party-party-party-party diva ♪</i>

712

713
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,545
Yes, queen!

714
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,445
<i>Foreman, any luck?</i>

715
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,363
<i>No device in here.</i>

716
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,073
Okay. One more, guys.

717
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:06,310
Huh?! Oh!

718
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:16,569
Mike!

719
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:28,540
Shit.

720
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:05,911
You got it?

721
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:07,788
Boom.

722
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:08,997
Look at that, huh?

723
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,420
Wow.

724
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:17,422
You did good, Mike.

725
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,259
Not bad for a nobody, huh?

726
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:24,179
We got it. We're on our way out.

727
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,059
Athena?

728
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:41,446
Oh shit.

729
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:46,034
Oh no, no, no. Hang in there, sweetie.
Frankie's here, baby. Come on. I got you.

730
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:49,163
There we go. Come on. Hey, baby.

731
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:52,100
Tell 'em to get the med bay ready.
We're coming in now. Come on, sweetie.

732
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,167
She's dead, Frank.

733
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:01,842
Goddamn it!

734
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:18,275
Boss, we've been compromised.
You gotta get out of there.

735
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:19,401
Clear the building!

736
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,001
Oh shit.

737
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:48,806
Could be the damn Russians again.
Revenge for the Seven Dials.

738
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:51,266
No, bro.
How'd they know about our headquarters?

739
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,435
Someone's got eyes on us.

740
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:54,519
Wait.

741
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,916
- It's Brennan.
- It's Brennan!

742
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:58,941
Boss, you okay?

743
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:00,651
Yeah, we got it.

744
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:03,403
Athena... We lost her.

745
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,073
Okay.

746
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,199
You got it.

747
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:10,619
Bomb missed most of the control rooms.

748
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:14,373
I don't have numbers on the casualties,
but we're still on our feet, just.

749
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:15,499
Now what?

750
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:17,501
Scatter. Wait for word.

751
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:48,156
- This is your safe house?
- Yeah, one of 'em.

752
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:57,999
You okay?

753
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:00,751
Yup.

754
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,922
I'm sorry about your friend, Rox.

755
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:08,343
I'm here if you wanna talk.

756
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:12,847
Yeah.

757
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:31,366
- I'll sleep on the chair.
- You can't sleep in the chair.

758
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,994
I can make a bed in the corner,
on the floor.

759
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:36,622
You can sleep in the bed, Mike.

760
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,935
It's not really
a safe house, is it?

761
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,273
It's more like a safe room.

762
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:08,487
- Yeah.
- Right?

763
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:09,570
Yeah.

764
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:16,244
You gonna hog the blankets
like you always did?

765
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:19,498
I didn't hog the blankets.

766
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,960
- Oh yeah, you did.
- Oh no, I didn't.

767
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:23,877
Oh, you did.

768
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,379
No, I didn't.

769
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:30,008
You did. And......you snore too.

770
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:36,056
I didn't snore. You snored.

771
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,725
- No, you snored. You always snored.
- No, you snored.

772
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,185
You snored.

773
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:42,270
- What are you, five?
- You're five.

774
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:45,941
Go to sleep, silly.

775
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,488
And just for the record,

776
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,408
I'm not makin' a move on you here.

777
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:57,244
Just for the record,

778
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:59,036
me either.

779
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,129
<i>Officials say
it was an electrical spark</i>

780
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:10,799
<i>that triggered the explosion
at the iconic London landmark last night.</i>

781
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:13,427
<i>Several people were taken to hospital
for their injuries,</i>

782
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,471
<i>but so far, there have been
no reported deaths from the accident.</i>

783
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:19,016
Electrical spark?
That's the best they could come up with?

784
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,518
Almost sounds believable, huh?

785
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:25,147
Brennan called.
The auction's at 1800 hours. Let's get it.

786
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,735
<i>The next station is Queensway.</i>

787
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,654
<i>Please mind the gap
between the train and the platform.</i>

788
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,561
Good to see you, boss.

789
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:08,190
Good to be seen. Some of us got lucky.

790
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:09,982
Yeah.

791
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:12,778
What's the body count?

792
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:17,532
Let's, uh... let's focus on that
after we punch back, okay?

793
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,075
Okay.

794
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,454
Well, looks like it's up and running.

795
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:24,664
Activated last night.
Foreman's working on it.

796
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:27,626
We should be able to track Quinn's signal
as soon as the auction starts,

797
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:29,086
but then we gotta make sure

798
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,671
the bidding lasts long enough
to get the exact location.

799
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:34,674
If the buy-in's five million dollars,
how much will the bidding go up to?

800
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,551
Like, enough to buy the Knicks

801
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:39,262
and pay somebody
to teach 'em how to play basketball.

802
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,556
Holy shit. Who's floating the cash?

803
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,640
We are.

804
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:44,975
Who are you?

805
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,061
I'm the CIA.

806
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:48,814
And we're funding
tonight's little dance,

807
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:50,899
so if you could grab Quinn and the intel

808
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:55,403
before the US government finance
the 401K of every foreign hostile

809
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:59,574
between here and Pyongyang,
well, then we sure would appreciate it.

810
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,161
Get the intel,
you live to fight another day.

811
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:06,081
Screw it up, that's the Union done.

812
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,794
Where can I get a coffee around here?

813
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:35,777
<i>Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

814
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,946
<i>Welcome to tonight's auction.</i>

815
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,197
Okay. Foreman.

816
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,574
Just started.

817
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:43,160
- Roxanne?
- Moving into position now.

818
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:46,496
- Had any disco fries today, Mike?
- Nope.

819
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,624
Great. They're not as good
the second time around.

820
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,918
Some things can be.

821
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:55,547
<i>With only one item on the docket,
we'll begin bidding straightaway</i>

822
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,175
<i>at the opening price
of 100 million dollars.</i>

823
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,677
<i>- I have 100 million. 125.</i>
- Hey, Bezos?

824
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:04,389
If you don't wanna be working a forklift
on Monday, get the damn tracker working!

825
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:06,600
- Um, almost there.
- Come on now.

826
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,226
It's my boss.

827
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,310
<i>150 million.</i>

828
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:13,398
He probably wants to know if he needs
to sell one of the states to pay for this.

829
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,151
I think we could lose Idaho.
Nobody'd notice.

830
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:18,653
- I'm from Idaho.
- You think I don't know that?

831
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,114
We got a signal yet?

832
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,242
<i>- 175 million.</i>
- Right. Here we go.

833
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:25,535
Showtime.

834
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:29,080
Getting the lockdown
on the location. Rox, start heading east.

835
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,164
Got it.

836
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,009
<i>200 million dollars.</i>

837
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:43,261
It's narrowing down
to the Southwark area.

838
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,640
A heads-up
would be nice, Rox.

839
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:50,477
Hold on, Mike.

840
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,980
<i>250 million.</i>

841
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,777
<i>Do I have 275?</i>

842
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,075
<i>275 million.</i>

843
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:07,452
I hope you know what you're doing.

844
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:09,204
<i>300 million dollars.</i>

845
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:10,455
Not my money.

846
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,878
<i>325 million.</i>

847
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:24,261
<i>Do I have an advance on 325 million?</i>

848
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:27,305
<i>Do I have 350 million?</i>

849
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,849
- Dude.
- Um, it's calibrating. I need more time.

850
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,269
<i>Do I have 350?</i>

851
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:35,730
- Okay
<i>- 350 million dollars.</i>

852
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,025
<i>Do I have 375?</i>

853
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:44,948
<i>Going once.</i>

854
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,869
- Brennan.
- What do you want me to do? My bid is in.

855
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,330
You know how an auction works?
I can't bid against myself.

856
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:53,498
<i>Going twice.</i>

857
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,503
<i>I have 375 million.</i>

858
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:00,672
<i>We're still alive, Rox.
Net closin' in.</i>

859
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,687
<i>They're somewhere
near St. Paul's.</i>

860
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:07,387
Two minutes out.

861
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,015
Okay, we're close. We've got a location.

862
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:12,976
About to locate the building.

863
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:15,186
<i>- 425 million.</i>
- No. No. What happened?

864
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:18,273
- Uh, shit, it's buffering.
- "Shit, it's buffering."

865
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:20,066
<i>Where to, Foreman?</i>

866
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:23,320
<i>This</i> is your computer guy?
He looks like the janitor.

867
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:25,047
- Can we get a young person?
- Hold on, man!

868
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:26,632
- I'll do it myself.
<i>- Going twice.</i>

869
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:29,909
- How do you work this thing?
- What are you doin'? Don't do...

870
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:33,580
<i>- New bid at 550 million dollars.</i>
- Shit. I...

871
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,623
- There goes Boise.
- Connection's back.

872
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:39,836
<i>- Rox, she's in Nicholls Avenue.</i>
- Nice job, Foreman.

873
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:45,549
Roxanne?

874
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,720
- We're closin' in.
- Right, you're a block away.

875
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:50,972
<i>Do I have 575 million?</i>

876
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,640
There! Rooftop level.

877
00:55:58,271 --> 00:56:00,815
["All I Need"

878
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,415
Six hundred million dollars.

879
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:21,002
Do I have any advance
on six hundred million dollars?

880
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,754
How about zero dollars,

881
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:26,007
and I don't advance this bullet
through your skull?

882
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:27,091
Damn.

883
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:29,177
That concludes tonight's bidding.

884
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:34,432
Roxanne Hall.

885
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:38,395
I'm surprised they let the Union
stay involved after Trieste.

886
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:42,357
After six of our people got killed,
we don't pass this to nobody else.

887
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,652
You shouldn't let this job
get too personal. Clouds the judgment.

888
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,195
It's all personal.

889
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:51,866
Mr. Weston, how duplicitous of you.

890
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:55,745
It's Mike McKenna.
Jersey branch. Where's Ricky tonight?

891
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,872
He has his yoga class on Tuesdays.

892
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,419
- Where's the intel, Quinn?
- You know you can call me Juliet, darling.

893
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:06,047
I'll be callin' you "that bitch I buried
in London" if you don't start talkin'.

894
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:10,301
You see, this is why
I hate dealing with the agencies.

895
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:13,138
Everything always starts at a ten,
doesn't it?

896
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:14,848
Shoulda seen her in high school.

897
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:18,351
The intelligence is in a lockbox
in Holland Park.

898
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:20,437
I'm... very happy to drive you.

899
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,688
I'll drive.

900
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:24,065
You're in the passenger seat.

901
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:27,444
He's in the back
with a gun pointed at your head.

902
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:28,528
How's that sound?

903
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:31,114
Fabulous.

904
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:13,823
Oh, for God's sake.
It's not bloody booby-trapped.

905
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:14,907
You can relax.

906
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:21,955
Mmm.

907
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,014
Thank you.

908
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:51,568
Is that it?

909
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,571
Yup, that's it.

910
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:55,740
Congratulations.

911
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,409
Let's go.

912
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,414
- You expecting somebody?
- No.

913
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:20,138
Rox.

914
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:23,809
Nick.

915
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:25,143
Roxanne,

916
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:27,438
your life is in danger.

917
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:30,483
All of our lives are in danger.

918
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,862
Please... let me in.

919
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:49,586
Well, this evening gets
stranger and stranger.

920
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:52,839
Agent Faraday... back from the dead.

921
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:57,468
- Nick Faraday. Local 12-25.
- Oh, cool. You're Union.

922
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:59,053
- That's right.
- Hi.

923
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:03,016
One of the six dead agents in Trieste.
You're looking well for it.

924
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,099
How?

925
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:07,061
How... how are you still alive, Nick?

926
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:09,272
The current carried me to the ocean.

927
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:12,734
Got myself to a doctor,
then got myself here.

928
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,486
Rox, Trieste was a setup.

929
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:19,699
Someone knew we were coming.
That means there's a leak in the Union.

930
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:23,745
So, what? You were just playing dead
until you figured out who it was?

931
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:26,623
- That's right.
- You shoulda told me.

932
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:29,751
- It was to keep you safe.
- I can keep myself safe, Nick.

933
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:31,461
Gimme a name.

934
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:35,965
- Tom Brennan.
- No.

935
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:38,593
The stolen intel has details
on everyone who's ever worked

936
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:41,220
for the US government
going back to the Cold War,

937
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:42,764
including mission logs.

938
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:45,475
Including classified mission logs.

939
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:48,936
How much do you know about
Tom Brennan before he set up the Union?

940
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:51,898
Did you know he used to run black ops
for the CIA?

941
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:54,317
Tom Brennan has a history, Rox.

942
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,445
He's done things
our government has felt compelled to bury.

943
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:59,947
Things that were never meant
to see the light of day.

944
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:03,242
All right, but if all that was true,
how come you didn't tell me?

945
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,494
I was trying to protect you.

946
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:07,789
You spent two weeks pretending to be dead.
Why should she trust you, asshole?

947
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:09,874
'Cause I'm married to her, asshole.

948
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,167
What?

949
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,380
We're separated.

950
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:17,422
Really?

951
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:20,134
<i>- This</i> guy?
- What's that supposed to mean?

952
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:22,720
I'm sure her dad was pleased as punch
when you walked in.

953
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:24,430
Bill and I had a great rapport.

954
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:27,642
Oh, Bill? You didn't have to call him
Mr. Hall like everybody else?

955
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:29,560
Let me tell you about me and Bill.

956
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:31,955
- Yeah, no, no, no, tell me.
- Hey, we're not gonna do this.

957
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:34,107
They ought to call this the <i>"Re-</i>union."

958
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:36,984
You got proof that it was Brennan?

959
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:40,029
Proof is in the intel.
And it can't go to Brennan.

960
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:41,823
Who do you suggest giving it to?

961
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:44,992
Cameron Foster and the CIA are in London
overseeing the operation.

962
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:46,119
Hand it over to them.

963
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:48,705
That guy who thinks he's Gary Oldman?
He's full of shit.

964
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:50,288
Listen, new guy.

965
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:53,084
Why don't you bench yourself
and let the grown-ups talk, okay?

966
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:56,087
This guy
had all the combat training, right?

967
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:58,506
Yes, Mike. He'd beat you in a fight.

968
01:01:58,589 --> 01:02:00,925
All right, I'll let that slide. This time.

969
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:03,928
Roxanne, I'm asking you to trust me.

970
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,639
Brennan will kill for this intel.

971
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:10,560
Too many Union agents are dead.
I don't wanna see anyone else join them.

972
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:12,520
Especially not you, baby.

973
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:17,650
Trieste, the Seven Dials, the HQ.

974
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:20,111
You know it makes sense.

975
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:22,113
Brennan.

976
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:24,866
He'll have a track on your location.
We should scatter.

977
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:26,826
Suppose you want the intel as well?

978
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:29,454
No. The CIA can arrange a pickup.

979
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:32,582
We can rendezvous
at the Albert Bridge at dawn,

980
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:35,334
and we can pass it over together.
Let them handle this.

981
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:36,669
What about her?

982
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,797
Oh, darling.
No, I'm just a simple middleman.

983
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:42,049
Best to cut me loose, I'd say.

984
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:43,259
Let me handle her.

985
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:10,244
Rox. Rox!

986
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:11,496
Come on.

987
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:13,831
Well, now she's stealing a car.
That's good.

988
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,221
Husband.

989
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:31,849
Uh-uh. We're not gonna do that.

990
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:33,893
You didn't wanna tell me you were married?

991
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:37,188
A, we're separated.
B, I thought he was dead.

992
01:03:37,271 --> 01:03:39,732
Yeah, like ten minutes
before you came to see me.

993
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,859
You drive right to the bar
after the funeral?

994
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:44,737
- Why would that matter to you?
- You know why it matters to me!

995
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:48,074
Do you care that I've been married
to somebody in the last 25 years?

996
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:49,742
To <i>that</i> asshole? A little bit. I do.

997
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:53,204
Okay. What was that shit about my dad?
"Oh, I bet you call him Mr. Hall."

998
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:55,414
Like somehow as if <i>my</i> dad was the problem.

999
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,291
If you wanna talk about it, let's talk.

1000
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:59,877
Your father had a problem
because you had a Black girlfriend.

1001
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,504
Your dad didn't like me either.

1002
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:03,627
They were being protective.
They were old-fashioned.

1003
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:06,384
Old-fashioned. Let me pull out
my appropriate racism chart,

1004
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:09,971
and let's see where old-fashioned falls
between small-town housewife

1005
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:12,974
and Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan!

1006
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,479
My dad was an asshole.
I should've said something.

1007
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,439
- Yeah.
- I shoulda done a lot, and I didn't.

1008
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:23,418
But you shoulda told me the truth
before manipulating me into coming here!

1009
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:26,028
I didn't manipulate you. I saved you!

1010
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:28,948
I came and dragged you
out of your small, little life.

1011
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:31,343
- "My small, little life." Yeah, well.
- Yeah.

1012
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,452
I gave you an opportunity
to be a part of something.

1013
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:36,789
I gotta tell you, Rox.
It might not be perfect, but it's honest.

1014
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:40,960
Yeah. I live in the same house.
I got the same job and the same friends.

1015
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:43,754
And you know why?
'Cause I can count on them.

1016
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:46,299
They'd lie in traffic for me.
I'd do the same for them!

1017
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:49,927
Can you say that about the people
that you have in your life? I doubt it.

1018
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:51,012
But...

1019
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:53,306
Maybe I can, maybe I can't.

1020
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:55,641
But this is a chance for <i>you,</i> Mike.

1021
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,352
You wanna go back to Paterson
and throw that all away?

1022
01:04:58,436 --> 01:04:59,604
Oh, just stop, Rox.

1023
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:05,401
How come everybody else
can see your potential except for you?

1024
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:08,696
You know, thanks for the advice.
See you at the next high school reunion.

1025
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:56,661
<i>Hey, Mikey! Hey, man, where you at?</i>

1026
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:59,372
<i>You are missing an epic bachelor party!</i>

1027
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:01,582
I know, but I am so sorry. I'm...

1028
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:07,380
<i>Check it out! This ass belongs
to Stephanie Tranata after Sunday!</i>

1029
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:09,465
<i>- Woo-hoo!</i>
- Whoa... Is that Ronnie?

1030
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:12,009
<i>- Hey, man! Look who it is!
- Mikey!</i>

1031
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:14,136
<i>- Yeah!
- That's my best man!</i>

1032
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:17,598
Ronnie, I promise you, I'm gonna be there
for the wedding, okay? I promise.

1033
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:19,642
<i>I'm never gonna forgive you, man!</i>

1034
01:06:19,725 --> 01:06:21,268
Keep your pants on.

1035
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:24,563
<i>I'm kidding! I'm kidding, bro.
We love you, buddy.</i>

1036
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:27,566
<i>Hey, whatever you're doin',
it's gotta be important, right?</i>

1037
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:28,650
<i>- Yeah!</i>
- Right.

1038
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:30,945
<i>You do you, Mikey!</i>

1039
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:36,617
Sorry about that.

1040
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:30,921
What are you doin' here, Mike?

1041
01:07:31,922 --> 01:07:34,050
The mission ain't over.
I ain't goin' home.

1042
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:38,179
- You're still an asshole.
- Oh, you've always been an asshole.

1043
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:41,223
- Thanks for coming, Mike.
- No problem.

1044
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:42,892
I would have got here a lot sooner,

1045
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:45,478
but I was standing on the wrong bridge
for 20 minutes.

1046
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:48,397
He should be here.

1047
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:07,124
So I'm on the bridge, Nick,
and you're not here.

1048
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:09,919
I'm guessing this isn't gonna be
great news, is it?

1049
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:13,756
<i>- Afraid I'm not coming, Rox.</i>
- Oh, what? So this was a setup?

1050
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:15,007
<i>You</i> and <i>Brennan.</i>

1051
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:18,302
If you check your bank balance,
you'll see a parting gift

1052
01:08:18,385 --> 01:08:21,347
<i>of a quarter of the proceeds
from the buy-in to the auction.</i>

1053
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:24,308
I had to, uh, cover my escape.

1054
01:08:24,391 --> 01:08:25,768
What about the intel?

1055
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:28,729
The bags switched back at the house.

1056
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:32,274
<i>I mean, the Iranians did promise
good money for it.</i>

1057
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:35,111
<i>Wouldn't be fair
to leave 'em empty-handed.</i>

1058
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:37,780
And the Union? No loyalty, Nick?

1059
01:08:37,863 --> 01:08:38,948
<i>Yeah, the Union.</i>

1060
01:08:39,031 --> 01:08:41,158
It sounds good in the beginning, you know?

1061
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:45,621
Then you save the world a few times,
and there's no credit and no reward.

1062
01:08:45,704 --> 01:08:49,083
<i>Brennan's blue-collar bullshit
really started to piss me off</i>

1063
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:52,670
right around the time my wife decided
she'd had enough of me

1064
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:55,548
just because... I wanted more.

1065
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:59,468
You didn't have to kill Athena
or bomb the London branch.

1066
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:02,471
I would've stopped at Trieste
if you guys hadn't been so persistent.

1067
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:04,348
<i>And I was content to play dead forever,</i>

1068
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:07,059
<i>but once you got the Koreans' device,
I had to take the Union out.</i>

1069
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:09,228
Or you and Brennan
would never stop coming after me.

1070
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:10,646
You're right about that.

1071
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:13,566
And that would've
cramped my style, Roxanne.

1072
01:09:14,608 --> 01:09:15,943
And we wouldn't want that.

1073
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:19,572
- Well, that's disappointing.
- Roxanne.

1074
01:09:25,202 --> 01:09:26,245
Look here, Nick.

1075
01:09:27,204 --> 01:09:29,206
In the history of men screwin' up,

1076
01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:32,418
you might have just screwed up the worst.

1077
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:34,586
Hmm.

1078
01:09:34,628 --> 01:09:36,213
I'll be seeing you, baby.

1079
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,065
Drop the intel. Hit the ground now.

1080
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:57,776
Come on, Foster.
You can't possibly think all this is real.

1081
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:00,362
Agent Hall. Agent...

1082
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:02,281
Mike!

1083
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:06,493
Agent Mike, you got five seconds
before we open fire!

1084
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:09,413
- Look, when I say go, follow me.
- Follow you? Where?

1085
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:11,665
- Remember the trust exercise?
- Yeah.

1086
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:13,101
- Did I let you die?
- Two.

1087
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:14,585
- Shit. Yeah.
- Remember that.

1088
01:10:14,668 --> 01:10:18,172
That shiner, is that what Brennan gave you
while you were handcuffin' him?

1089
01:10:18,255 --> 01:10:20,549
Yeah, I know.
He's quite fast for an old man.

1090
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:22,760
Maybe prison will slow him down.

1091
01:10:22,843 --> 01:10:25,304
Yeah, well, he taught me
everything I know.

1092
01:10:28,849 --> 01:10:29,849
Go!

1093
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,272
Shit!

1094
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:40,110
Oh! Goddamn! Come on! Get out of my way!

1095
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:52,289
I want that goddamned son of a bitch boat
pulled over! No one gets off!

1096
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:54,291
<i>Please halt your vessel.</i>

1097
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,045
<i>Sir, please pull your vessel to the shore.</i>

1098
01:10:58,629 --> 01:11:00,881
<i>You have known fugitives on board.</i>

1099
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:10,975
There's Faraday. Right there.

1100
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:15,145
- Oh, you put a track on him?
- Yeah, I put a track on him.

1101
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:17,106
<i>I might be an asshole, but I'm not stupid.</i>

1102
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:20,526
- I didn't mean that. I was just...
- I know. Forget it.

1103
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:21,944
Istria?

1104
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:25,489
Yup. But the truth is, Mike,
the Union is out of the game.

1105
01:11:25,572 --> 01:11:26,991
We're on the run from the CIA.

1106
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:29,952
Every cop and every agent in London
is looking for you,

1107
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:33,914
and if you get caught, you're looking
at hard time for treason, so, you know...

1108
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:37,668
Look, I'm not worried about it, all right?
I'm in it as long as you're in.

1109
01:11:40,879 --> 01:11:44,717
Okay. All we need to do now
is figure out how we get on a plane.

1110
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:47,928
Are you insane? Ah.

1111
01:11:48,512 --> 01:11:49,512
Bobby!

1112
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,892
- What the hell? Where you been?
<i>- Hey, hey, Bobby.</i>

1113
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:55,811
No bullshit, I swear to Christ.

1114
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:57,813
Roxanne, she kidnaps me,

1115
01:11:57,896 --> 01:12:01,275
she makes me join some secret agency
to fight terrorists in London.

1116
01:12:01,775 --> 01:12:03,986
Ha-ha. Real funny, asshole.
You had us worried.

1117
01:12:04,069 --> 01:12:06,488
<i>Ronnie's getting married on Sunday.
You gotta be here.</i>

1118
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:10,659
I need a favor. Are you still coordinating
all the cargo flights going out of Newark?

1119
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:13,746
Right. Nothin' leaves the airport
without me knowin' about it.

1120
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:15,122
<i>What do you need?</i>

1121
01:12:15,205 --> 01:12:18,292
You stupid? I need to leave an airport
without anybody knowing.

1122
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:34,183
- Gary?
- Yeah.

1123
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:40,397
Container 726.
Tell Bobby he owes me, yeah?

1124
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:41,482
I'll do that.

1125
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:55,495
Hey, here.

1126
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,822
Does this remind you of something?

1127
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:31,782
Think about it.

1128
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:35,702
Janitor's closet... by the gym.

1129
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:36,912
That's the one.

1130
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:38,831
- Eighth grade.
- Yeah.

1131
01:14:06,316 --> 01:14:07,316
Hey.

1132
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,110
Foster.

1133
01:14:10,654 --> 01:14:13,866
I assume you're sitting in your office
having a nice chai latte

1134
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:15,534
and listening in on this,

1135
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:18,328
<i>so I know you
and the whole Central Incompetence Agency</i>

1136
01:14:18,412 --> 01:14:21,790
<i>think I'm behind this,
and somehow, Roxanne Hall is involved</i>

1137
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:24,543
<i>and, of course, as usual,
you've got it dead wrong.</i>

1138
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:27,963
So now the Union is on ice, and meanwhile,

1139
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:30,924
the real bad guys, dollars to doughnuts,

1140
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:34,928
they're selling your stolen intelligence
right this goddamn minute.

1141
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:37,181
And you know what happens next?

1142
01:14:38,765 --> 01:14:42,019
An old flame of mine
runs a CIA office in Istanbul.

1143
01:14:43,353 --> 01:14:46,607
She'll be driving her grandkids
to soccer practice

1144
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:49,401
when the whole car's blown to smithereens

1145
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:52,571
because some terrorist cell
got her home address

1146
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:56,283
and the... and the make and model
of her car from your stolen intel!

1147
01:14:56,783 --> 01:14:59,495
Every agency, every employee,

1148
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:03,373
from the bigwigs to the regular Joes,
are gonna be droppin' like flies.

1149
01:15:04,124 --> 01:15:05,501
You ready for that, Foster?

1150
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:07,628
<i>'Cause this is coming down on your head.</i>

1151
01:15:08,712 --> 01:15:11,381
You better pray what's left of my team
can find that intel

1152
01:15:11,465 --> 01:15:12,966
before somebody else does.

1153
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:18,931
It's not that I think it's small.

1154
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:21,182
Excuse me?

1155
01:15:21,558 --> 01:15:23,810
Your life... in Paterson.

1156
01:15:24,436 --> 01:15:26,188
You know, what I said in the car?

1157
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:30,025
I don't think that your life
has been small.

1158
01:15:30,108 --> 01:15:31,108
Oh.

1159
01:15:32,986 --> 01:15:37,824
You know, I just needed to get out
and see what else was out there, you know?

1160
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:39,617
I get that.

1161
01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:44,373
Was it everything you wanted it to be?

1162
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:46,542
Sometimes.

1163
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:49,086
Sometimes, no.

1164
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:57,844
You know, I don't... know
if we definitely get out of this.

1165
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:00,847
We might not win this one,

1166
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:04,351
but I'm glad it's you and me.

1167
01:16:06,144 --> 01:16:09,273
And I'm really glad
I walked back into that bar.

1168
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:25,956
Oh, welcome to Istria. Oh-ho!

1169
01:16:26,039 --> 01:16:28,542
I read my travel guide on the way.

1170
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:32,838
Everywhere you go,
there's a Bobby Breslin, huh?

1171
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:44,433
- See you're still good at it.
- It's all in the wrist.

1172
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:57,446
Well, he always said
he wanted to sail around the world.

1173
01:16:57,529 --> 01:16:59,990
Looks like he's gonna get his chance.

1174
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:03,285
You two ever go on vacation together?

1175
01:17:03,368 --> 01:17:05,162
- Nope.
- Honeymoon?

1176
01:17:05,245 --> 01:17:06,245
Uh-uh.

1177
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:11,460
You ever go anywhere nice just to,
I don't know, hang out, go for a swim?

1178
01:17:11,543 --> 01:17:12,711
Not shoot somebody?

1179
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:15,380
Nope. Never.

1180
01:17:16,757 --> 01:17:18,300
It's worth thinkin' about.

1181
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:31,145
I knew it.

1182
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:40,322
Looks like they're on the move.

1183
01:17:41,406 --> 01:17:42,406
Let's go.

1184
01:17:46,453 --> 01:17:47,829
You okay, Rox? You cool?

1185
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:50,957
Yeah. I'm cool. Don't I look cool?

1186
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,919
Well, you always look cool, but... Oh shit.

1187
01:17:58,548 --> 01:18:00,967
That was either
the president of Croatia's motorcade...

1188
01:18:01,051 --> 01:18:03,720
Or the deal for the intel
is about to go down.

1189
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:27,869
Hi.

1190
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:29,705
Hi. Coca-Cola for me, and...

1191
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:31,330
Ice water.

1192
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:32,373
Sparkling.

1193
01:18:33,667 --> 01:18:34,668
Sparkling.

1194
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,751
Thank you.

1195
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,255
You brought bodyguards?

1196
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:41,591
Well, not as many as you.

1197
01:18:43,009 --> 01:18:46,179
You must treat with caution a man
who is willing to betray his friends.

1198
01:18:46,263 --> 01:18:47,848
The Union weren't my friends.

1199
01:18:48,348 --> 01:18:49,516
They were my employers.

1200
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:52,811
And now I'm freelance, so let's do this.

1201
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:55,856
I tease. Indeed.
Let's finish this quickly.

1202
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:10,162
Once the payment is verified,
we can complete the transaction.

1203
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:14,916
Once the intel is verified,
we can complete the payment.

1204
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:18,295
Well, well, well.

1205
01:19:18,378 --> 01:19:20,505
What are the odds, huh?

1206
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:24,551
You made a big mistake, Roxanne.

1207
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:28,764
- Who is this?
- This is Nick's former partner.

1208
01:19:28,847 --> 01:19:30,599
Professional and personal.

1209
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:33,393
- Hello, Rox.
- Hello, Juliet.

1210
01:19:33,477 --> 01:19:35,437
- Do we have a problem here?
- No.

1211
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:38,273
Oh, we absolutely have a problem here.

1212
01:19:38,982 --> 01:19:42,778
Any quarrel you have with Mr. Faraday
has nothing to do with me.

1213
01:19:43,361 --> 01:19:44,446
Okay, look here.

1214
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:47,240
If you wanna sit at the big kids' table

1215
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:50,702
and buy stolen secrets
from an ex-secret agent, fine by me,

1216
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:52,037
but what we're not gonna do

1217
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:55,081
<i>is sit here and pretend
like</i> you <i>don't know what you're doing.</i>

1218
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:57,918
<i>So what do you want, Rox?</i>

1219
01:19:58,001 --> 01:20:01,838
I want you to go to prison
for murder, espionage, and treason.

1220
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:05,717
- Roxanne.
- I'm taking you both in right now.

1221
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:08,845
- It appears we have a complication.
- I can assure you...

1222
01:20:08,929 --> 01:20:11,139
Your assurances are worth very little now.

1223
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:15,143
I'm afraid I must treat this
as the conclusion of our negotiations.

1224
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:20,989
Get off me.
Remove your hand!

1225
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:24,361
Get the intel!

1226
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:29,074
Get his bag!

1227
01:20:32,202 --> 01:20:35,747
It's a sad day when you can't even trust
an Iranian terror cell, huh?

1228
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:38,792
Like I said, Rox,
you made a big mistake coming here.

1229
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:41,920
Oh, my big mistake was marrying you.
Coming here was just reckless.

1230
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:43,046
I guess it was.

1231
01:20:44,089 --> 01:20:45,590
- Kill her.
- Wait.

1232
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:49,219
Nick, darling.

1233
01:20:49,719 --> 01:20:54,307
This was fun, but now it feels messy,
and that's just not me.

1234
01:20:55,141 --> 01:20:56,643
What are you talkin' about?

1235
01:20:56,726 --> 01:21:00,313
I think maybe the best thing for us
will be to have a little break. Hm?

1236
01:21:00,897 --> 01:21:03,733
- Chance for the dust to settle.
- Juliet.

1237
01:21:04,734 --> 01:21:08,697
Roxanne, if you live through this,
I'm sure you'll come after me.

1238
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:10,073
Oh, you can count on it.

1239
01:21:10,156 --> 01:21:13,201
Yes. Well, remember
that I spared your life

1240
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:16,413
and consider that I might be
more useful to you out in the field.

1241
01:21:17,455 --> 01:21:18,999
I expect we'll meet again.

1242
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:22,544
Nick, I suspect we probably won't.

1243
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:27,381
Juliet!

1244
01:21:29,759 --> 01:21:31,803
I just love a girls' girl, don't you?

1245
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:43,023
So that's what we're doing now, Rox?
You're just gonna shoot me in cold blood?

1246
01:21:43,106 --> 01:21:45,525
- Five dead in Trieste?
- They were collateral damage.

1247
01:21:45,609 --> 01:21:48,570
Oh, you're making this
easier and easier for me.

1248
01:21:48,653 --> 01:21:50,280
Get up. Let's go.

1249
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:09,925
Son of a bitch.

1250
01:22:18,558 --> 01:22:19,893
After him!

1251
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:38,453
If you come after me, Rox,
I'm gonna have to kill you.

1252
01:22:38,536 --> 01:22:40,705
Oh, I don't think that's gonna happen.

1253
01:22:46,336 --> 01:22:49,339
I could have taken you out in Trieste,
but I didn't.

1254
01:22:49,422 --> 01:22:52,759
Didn't or couldn't?
Let's find out, shall we?

1255
01:22:53,259 --> 01:22:56,596
<i>- Hey, Rox. Where are you?</i>
- Just regretting my life choices.

1256
01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:58,556
<i>What about you?</i>

1257
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,600
Up on the roof. It's getting real crowded.

1258
01:23:06,523 --> 01:23:07,732
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1259
01:23:09,567 --> 01:23:10,860
Here. Here.

1260
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:17,700
Shit.

1261
01:23:18,618 --> 01:23:20,203
<i>Rox, I could use a hand.</i>

1262
01:23:20,286 --> 01:23:21,579
On my way, Mike.

1263
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:25,625
Oh! Oh, I drop that, and it smashes,
you know who gets smashed next, right?

1264
01:23:25,709 --> 01:23:27,002
You don't get to go home.

1265
01:23:27,877 --> 01:23:29,796
You having second thoughts, huh?

1266
01:23:29,879 --> 01:23:31,631
Hey! No safety rope?

1267
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:35,010
My foreman would have your ass.
Oh, don't look down.

1268
01:23:35,093 --> 01:23:37,637
Here, here, here.
Come and get it. Come on.

1269
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:39,222
You want it? Come get it.

1270
01:24:17,177 --> 01:24:18,177
Mike!

1271
01:24:18,762 --> 01:24:19,846
I got this!

1272
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:23,600
Jesus! Oh!

1273
01:24:40,366 --> 01:24:41,493
Mike!

1274
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:45,663
You're welcome!

1275
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:46,748
<i>You're</i> welcome!

1276
01:24:58,301 --> 01:25:00,303
Try to hold onto this this time, okay?

1277
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:07,602
- I told you I got a couple of guys.
- Let's see if you can get some more.

1278
01:25:14,901 --> 01:25:15,901
That's enough, Rox.

1279
01:25:16,611 --> 01:25:18,321
That's enough.

1280
01:25:18,404 --> 01:25:20,907
Now give me the intel or lose her forever.

1281
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,201
Take the shot, Mike.

1282
01:25:23,993 --> 01:25:26,329
You do not have the shot, Mikey.

1283
01:25:26,412 --> 01:25:28,373
Go ahead, Mike. Do it.

1284
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:31,041
Don't do it.

1285
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,044
Go ahead, Mike.

1286
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:35,547
Be a good boy. Come on.

1287
01:25:44,889 --> 01:25:47,433
You had the shot.
You're just too chickenshit to take it.

1288
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:52,229
Mike, run!

1289
01:26:00,363 --> 01:26:01,698
Hey. Hey!

1290
01:26:04,033 --> 01:26:05,368
Hey!

1291
01:26:05,451 --> 01:26:06,451
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1292
01:26:15,503 --> 01:26:17,088
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

1293
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,299
Hi, sir. Hi. Here, let me help you out.

1294
01:26:19,382 --> 01:26:21,426
Come on. There you go.
Thank you very much.

1295
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:24,095
I will take good care of her.
I won't get a scratch on her.

1296
01:27:00,089 --> 01:27:02,133
Son of a bitch!

1297
01:27:33,164 --> 01:27:34,540
Shit!

1298
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:47,679
Mike! Where are you?

1299
01:27:47,762 --> 01:27:48,846
I'm in a car.

1300
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:49,764
Where?

1301
01:27:49,847 --> 01:27:50,890
I don't know!

1302
01:27:50,974 --> 01:27:52,558
What do you mean you don't know?

1303
01:27:52,642 --> 01:27:53,768
I'm in the trunk.

1304
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:55,436
In the trunk?

1305
01:28:06,322 --> 01:28:08,783
- Give it up, Nicky!
- You know I got the better car!

1306
01:28:08,866 --> 01:28:11,661
It's not about the car, baby!

1307
01:28:11,744 --> 01:28:13,288
It's about the driver!

1308
01:28:41,107 --> 01:28:42,191
Oh shit!

1309
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:45,778
What?

1310
01:28:45,862 --> 01:28:47,447
Wait. Oh!

1311
01:28:47,947 --> 01:28:50,033
<i>- That's</i> the trunk you're in!
- Yeah!

1312
01:28:50,116 --> 01:28:51,826
Well, get outta the trunk, Mike!

1313
01:28:51,909 --> 01:28:53,411
I'm workin' on it!

1314
01:29:03,963 --> 01:29:05,256
Oh shit! Rox!

1315
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:06,174
Wasn't me!

1316
01:29:32,825 --> 01:29:34,660
Mike, get back in the car!

1317
01:29:38,164 --> 01:29:40,124
- What?
- Get back in the car, Mike!

1318
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:04,648
You prick!

1319
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:09,362
Rox, where are ya? Let's go.

1320
01:30:09,445 --> 01:30:11,155
I'm heading north up the coast!

1321
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:12,615
<i>You still in the game?</i>

1322
01:30:12,698 --> 01:30:14,617
Yeah, I'm back in the game, Rox!

1323
01:30:15,451 --> 01:30:16,536
I'm back in the game.

1324
01:30:25,628 --> 01:30:26,963
Here you go, bitch!

1325
01:30:33,886 --> 01:30:35,555
Goddamn it.

1326
01:30:44,063 --> 01:30:46,065
Rox, are you taking a breather? Come on!

1327
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:47,358
No, smart-ass!

1328
01:30:59,745 --> 01:31:00,745
Shit.

1329
01:31:22,393 --> 01:31:23,561
Argh!

1330
01:31:41,662 --> 01:31:42,663
Mike!

1331
01:31:44,081 --> 01:31:45,208
Mike!

1332
01:31:51,047 --> 01:31:52,047
Mike.

1333
01:31:58,763 --> 01:31:59,847
Shit.

1334
01:32:01,098 --> 01:32:02,098
Hey.

1335
01:32:03,017 --> 01:32:05,102
What... You... You're alive?

1336
01:32:05,186 --> 01:32:07,647
Oh my God. Car started swerving.

1337
01:32:08,147 --> 01:32:10,441
I remember my training,
all couple weeks of it.

1338
01:32:10,983 --> 01:32:13,236
I just screamed,
and I just jumped outta the car.

1339
01:32:13,319 --> 01:32:16,072
It was actually pretty cool.
I think you'd have been impressed.

1340
01:32:18,574 --> 01:32:19,742
Why'd you stop?

1341
01:32:21,577 --> 01:32:23,663
'Cause I thought you were dead, asshole!

1342
01:32:24,247 --> 01:32:26,666
Aw! I didn't know you cared!
That is so sweet.

1343
01:32:26,749 --> 01:32:28,584
You know what?
You shoulda stayed in the car!

1344
01:32:28,668 --> 01:32:32,046
Hey, I almost died.
You could show a little sympathy.

1345
01:32:32,129 --> 01:32:33,422
A little softer side.

1346
01:32:37,093 --> 01:32:39,637
- You better hold on to something.
- Let's get his ass.

1347
01:32:43,599 --> 01:32:47,103
- I know where he's goin'.
- Oh, Mr. Big Shot on a big yacht, huh?

1348
01:32:47,186 --> 01:32:51,190
Well, we can't let that happen.
You know what? Bang a right right here.

1349
01:32:51,274 --> 01:32:52,483
Bang a right here.

1350
01:33:29,145 --> 01:33:31,355
- Okay, when I say "jump," jump, okay?
- Okay!

1351
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:33,983
Jump!

1352
01:33:34,066 --> 01:33:36,027
No! Wait! It's stuck! Oh!

1353
01:33:40,865 --> 01:33:41,907
God... damn!

1354
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:48,831
You threw a car at me?!

1355
01:33:49,415 --> 01:33:51,709
Hands on your head and hit the ground!

1356
01:33:52,543 --> 01:33:55,087
Hey, I'm gonna strangle you to death
with my bare hands!

1357
01:33:56,005 --> 01:33:59,342
- Get on the floor now, asshole!
- That's not how this is goin' down.

1358
01:33:59,425 --> 01:34:01,677
Oh, that's exactly
how it's goin' down, Nicky.

1359
01:34:01,761 --> 01:34:03,721
That's not how this is goin' down, Rox!

1360
01:34:04,221 --> 01:34:05,473
I can't go in!

1361
01:34:06,599 --> 01:34:07,683
Look at this!

1362
01:34:08,934 --> 01:34:10,186
Look at where we are!

1363
01:34:11,604 --> 01:34:12,730
Ain't it beautiful?

1364
01:34:13,981 --> 01:34:17,526
I'm not gonna spend the rest of my life
in a cage, Rox. No way.

1365
01:34:17,610 --> 01:34:19,487
Goddamn it, Nick! Hit the ground!

1366
01:34:19,570 --> 01:34:21,072
We could still sell it!

1367
01:34:21,822 --> 01:34:23,949
Hundreds of millions of dollars!

1368
01:34:25,242 --> 01:34:26,118
That could be us!

1369
01:34:26,202 --> 01:34:28,245
He's full of shit, Rox, and you know it.

1370
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:29,872
We could disappear.

1371
01:34:30,456 --> 01:34:33,751
Travel the world like we always...
like we always dreamed about.

1372
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:36,420
Funny thing I learned about me.

1373
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:37,504
I'm a homebody.

1374
01:34:43,552 --> 01:34:44,929
Rox!

1375
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:06,575
He didn't give you much choice, Rox.

1376
01:35:08,661 --> 01:35:09,661
Nope.

1377
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:21,381
So what now?

1378
01:35:27,847 --> 01:35:29,306
Look, we all know

1379
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:32,101
you can never predict
how two people will fall in love.

1380
01:35:32,184 --> 01:35:35,020
Sometimes they meet in high school,
and they know right away.

1381
01:35:35,104 --> 01:35:38,566
Sometimes they meet at a bar in Jersey...

1382
01:35:38,649 --> 01:35:41,152
...one of them gets drunk
and takes his shirt off...

1383
01:35:42,194 --> 01:35:43,279
It wasn't me.

1384
01:35:44,697 --> 01:35:48,242
And thankfully, somebody else
happens to be the bartender,

1385
01:35:48,325 --> 01:35:50,953
and she has to drive his sorry ass home.

1386
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:54,498
When I heard they were tying the knot,
I wasn't upset.

1387
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:57,001
We were absolutely relieved.

1388
01:35:57,084 --> 01:36:00,796
Finally, somebody was crazy enough
to take this guy off of our hands.

1389
01:36:02,214 --> 01:36:05,092
No, seriously. I love ya,
and I'm always here for you.

1390
01:36:05,176 --> 01:36:07,762
Congratulations.
Give it up for them, guys!

1391
01:36:08,596 --> 01:36:09,680
Mike, cheers!

1392
01:36:11,307 --> 01:36:12,307
God bless you.

1393
01:36:13,058 --> 01:36:14,560
Congrats. Congratulations.

1394
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:17,480
Boys, better get ready.

1395
01:36:19,148 --> 01:36:22,651
Ready, brother.
Hey, I'll see you on the floor?

1396
01:36:22,735 --> 01:36:23,569
Yeah.

1397
01:36:23,652 --> 01:36:25,571
- Get ready for me.
- You got it.

1398
01:36:27,072 --> 01:36:28,072
Nice speech.

1399
01:36:29,241 --> 01:36:30,618
Rox.

1400
01:36:31,410 --> 01:36:33,204
I didn't know you crash weddings
in Paterson.

1401
01:36:33,287 --> 01:36:35,164
I told you I was a homebody.

1402
01:36:36,874 --> 01:36:39,251
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.

1403
01:36:39,335 --> 01:36:40,920
- So do you.
- Thank <i>you.</i>

1404
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,673
So, uh, this is a

1405
01:36:45,716 --> 01:36:46,842
good turnout.

1406
01:36:49,261 --> 01:36:51,722
Wait, is... is that Ms. Hoffman?

1407
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:53,182
- No. No, don't.
- Is that her?

1408
01:36:53,265 --> 01:36:54,265
Please.

1409
01:36:55,017 --> 01:36:56,017
Ms. Hoffman!

1410
01:36:57,061 --> 01:36:58,061
Hi!

1411
01:36:59,438 --> 01:37:00,606
Hey, Nicole.

1412
01:37:01,774 --> 01:37:04,527
- Oh, Nicole. Oh, right, Nicole.
- Yeah, Nicole.

1413
01:37:04,610 --> 01:37:06,278
You know, Nicole looks good.

1414
01:37:06,362 --> 01:37:09,198
- You had to do that, didn't you?
- I'm sorry, yes.

1415
01:37:09,281 --> 01:37:12,618
["This Will Be"

1416
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:21,585
- Mike, get out here!
- Come on, Mikey!

1417
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:24,630
You know, Rox,
when I was up on that mountain,

1418
01:37:24,713 --> 01:37:26,173
and you thought I was dead...

1419
01:37:26,257 --> 01:37:27,091
Yeah.

1420
01:37:27,174 --> 01:37:30,845
...even though Faraday might have got away,
you came back for me.

1421
01:37:31,971 --> 01:37:32,971
And your point is?

1422
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:35,182
Nothing. I mean, I just...

1423
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:38,853
- I think I saw a few tears there.
- No, you didn't.

1424
01:37:38,936 --> 01:37:40,187
- Okay.
- Sorry.

1425
01:37:40,271 --> 01:37:41,146
Hmm.

1426
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:43,232
- Well, what about you?
- What?

1427
01:37:43,315 --> 01:37:45,025
When Faraday had the gun to my head,

1428
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:47,152
you could have taken a shot,
and you didn't.

1429
01:37:49,238 --> 01:37:50,322
It was too risky.

1430
01:37:51,782 --> 01:37:53,117
I gave you permission.

1431
01:37:53,742 --> 01:37:55,995
I don't care.
I would never take that chance.

1432
01:37:57,580 --> 01:37:59,248
I don't wanna mess up your hair.

1433
01:38:02,084 --> 01:38:05,963
You know, I think I saw
a... janitor's closet back there.

1434
01:38:08,382 --> 01:38:09,382
Wanna go?

1435
01:38:10,384 --> 01:38:11,594
Are you serious?

1436
01:38:11,677 --> 01:38:12,678
Yes, I'm serious.

1437
01:38:12,761 --> 01:38:14,054
