1
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,059
In the future, humans will have
developed a star gate system,

2
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,390
allowing spacecraft to traverse

3
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,799
vast distances instantaneously

4
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,089
by creating artificial
wormholes and distorting space,

5
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:59,690
reaching distant extraterrestrial
destinations spanning tens of light-years.

6
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,870
Report to Star Gate Dispatch Station,

7
00:01:01,871 --> 00:01:04,439
orbital data has been
sent, requesting approach.

8
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,580
Airline 0722.

9
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:06,830
Mrs. Star Seeker.

10
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,540
Mrs. Star Seeker can get closer.

11
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,299
With the frequent use of star gates,

12
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,999
people have started encountering
a highly unlikely occurrence.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,819
If a spacecraft miscalculates
during the journey through a star gate,

14
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,838
it will be trapped in the
distorted space behind the gate,

15
00:01:32,839 --> 00:01:34,759
and this is referred to as the

16
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,470
[Star Abyss]

17
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,588
These spacecraft can be trapped
for several years or even decades,

18
00:01:44,589 --> 00:01:45,989
with no possibility of rescue

19
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,540
and no survivors.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,619
Upon the discovery of the
existence of the Star Abyss,

21
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,409
in order to prevent accidents,

22
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,070
many spacecraft are
equipped with hibernation pods.

23
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:56,660
[Mrs. Star Seeker]

24
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,039
In case a spacecraft gets trapped,

25
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,239
the crew can enter a hibernation state

26
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,160
until the spacecraft is freed.

27
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,619
But not all spacecraft

28
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,220
allocate expensive hibernation
chambers for each crew member.

29
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,909
Some people may choose to take
chances in an attempt to save money,

30
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,330
thinking they can
overcome the odds and fate.

31
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,829
The Mrs. Star Seeker was
originally just a cargo spacecraft,

32
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,119
but the greedy captain illegally
carried far more passengers

33
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,030
than the approved capacity.

34
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,370
Now, we are trapped in the Star Abyss

35
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,329
with only 4 hibernation pods.

36
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,869
What's even worse is that

37
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,289
we are not the only ones

38
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,990
on the spacecraft.

39
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,020
The monster is catching up again!

40
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,990
Keep running!

41
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,240
Duo, run!

42
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,490
This is an airlock module.

43
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,329
Outside is a vacuum

44
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,620
with no way out.

45
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,409
I'll manually initiate the
depressurization process shortly.

46
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,699
Once that happens, the door
can only be opened from the inside,

47
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,380
and you'll be safe.

48
00:04:31,381 --> 00:04:32,590
What about you then?

49
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,159
Wait until it's quiet outside
before you come out.

50
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,830
Remember, go find Ji Ya.

51
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,370
If you get injured,

52
00:04:43,371 --> 00:04:44,409
it can save your life.

53
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,489
But you're already injured.

54
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,160
Take it. Don't lose it.

55
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,910
This is from your parents.

56
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,320
They will surely protect you.

57
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,210
Go!

58
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,330
You must survive.

59
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,540
Duo,

60
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,560
there's something I need to tell you.

61
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,159
I'm the one who caused the death
of 80,000 people in Sailor Valley,

62
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,700
including your parents.

63
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,210
I'm sorry.

64
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,345
Come on.

65
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:06,830
[24 hours ago]

66
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,720
[Mrs. Star Seeker, a cargo spacecraft]

67
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,509
[Ji Ya, the navigator of Mrs.
Star Seeker, a cargo spacecraft]

68
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,880
Mrs. Star Seeker.

69
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,449
This is the Star Gate Dispatch Station.

70
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,449
Why hasn't your cargo
manifest been declared?

71
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,329
If you don't report it soon, your
flight authorization will be canceled.

72
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,329
What illegal goods are you smuggling again?

73
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,459
Don't implicate me.

74
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,730
What do you mean "you"?

75
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,470
You think too highly of me.

76
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:47,140
[The captain of Mrs. Star
Seeker, a cargo spacecraft]

77
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,800
Only the captain knows

78
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,959
what's on board.

79
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:50,220
[Mrs. Star Seeker]

80
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,119
What are you still sitting there for?

81
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,639
Hurry up and find a solution!

82
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,999
If there's something wrong with the cargo,

83
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,600
you won't get a single penny.

84
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,500
Now you remember me.

85
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:04,060
We need to have a
serious talk about the bonus.

86
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,660
Ji Ya,

87
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,720
how much longer do we have to wait?

88
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,450
Thirty minutes.

89
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,650
You need to hurry.

90
00:07:13,651 --> 00:07:15,580
Otherwise, our spot will be taken.

91
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,449
Those passengers illegally
carried in the cargo hold

92
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,250
were all arranged by you, right?

93
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,830
Some were looking for a cheap ride,

94
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,850
but others...

95
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,380
Besides,

96
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,959
that cargo container...

97
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,290
You know what I mean.

98
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,870
Of course I know.

99
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,209
Let's talk outside.

100
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,349
The profits need to be split
evenly between us this time.

101
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,350
You ungrateful kid.

102
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,320
I've arranged everything.

103
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,610
I'm well-connected

104

at the dispatch station.

105
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,790
It's so expensive.

106
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,970
They might as well just rob us.

107
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,189
Stop pretending to be clueless.

108
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,989
Even though it's always you getting
the lion's share, and I get the crumbs,

109
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,409
that's still my money.

110
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,370
You can't deny it.

111
00:08:20,371 --> 00:08:21,419
Don't forget

112
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,329
you're the one who damaged
the seal on the Sailor Valley.

113

Besides me,

who dares to use a
wanted criminal like you?

115
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,468
You know I was innocent.

116
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:35,329
Why do you keep bringing
that up? Is it amusing to you?

117
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,990
Go check out a guy

Xing Tian?

120
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,260
Which one?

121
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,720
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

122
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,490

be sharp

and check what's inside.

126
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,130
Okay.

127

It's me.

00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,950
It's strange.

130

There's no reason to spend so much money

Why are you still chasing after me?

142
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,140
I'm just a special agent.

143
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,929
Whether you were innocent
or not is for the law to decide.

144
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,760
So many people died.

145
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,740
If you truly believe you were innocent,

146
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,760
then come back with me
to prove your innocence.

147
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,730
Do you think I wanted to harm them?

148
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,720
I wanted to save them too.

149
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,190
I didn't want to collide.

150

I'm not here to find you this time.

151

There's someone more
dangerous on the spacecraft.

152

You just focus on being a fugitive.

It is invaluable.

161
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,940
That's illegal.

162
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,290
Nonsense,

00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,850
The initially set transit
time was 30 minutes,

339
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,470
1,800 seconds.

340
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,020
Now, the transit time

341
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,050
has changed to 220 million seconds.

342
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,960
Calculating it,

343
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,200
we'll be trapped for 7 years.

344
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,410
Seven years?

345
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,740
We won't make it through.

346
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,130
The air and water on the ship

347
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:44,599
aren't enough for so
many people to last 7 years.

348
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,929
In the cabin, there are 2 smuggled killers.

349
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,440
To survive,

350
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,710
they will surely kill all of us.

351
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,190
Xing Tian and the people he
brought won't just sit idly by.

352
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:57,550
By then, the cabin will
definitely turn into a battlefield.

353
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,539
Come over here quickly.

354
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,290
Come here.

355
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,550
Duo.

356
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,760
In any case,

357
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,589
we need to take out the Twins first.

358
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,659
They are more dangerous than you think.

359
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,470
Calm down.

360
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:07,800
Don't go.

361
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:14,710
Follow me later.

362
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:15,300
Okay.

363
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,100
This is a cargo ship,

364
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,829
standardly designed to
accommodate only 4 people.

365
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,990
The maximum limit

366
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,220
is just 1 year.

367
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,319
Right now, we have 21 people on board,

368
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,490
which means,

369
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,410
we can last two months

370
00:25:26,411 --> 00:25:27,740
at most.

371
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,739
If it really comes to that point,

372
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,370
I only ask you for one thing,

373
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,840
let me die quickly and painlessly.

374
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,119
I just have bad luck,

375
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,490
I accept my fate.

376
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,990
But there's still a little girl
on the spacecraft, she...

377
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,360
To survive,

378
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,870
we still have a way.

379
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:16,040
We still have 4 hibernation pods.

380
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,190
[Mrs. Star Seeker
Spaceship Hibernation Pods]

381
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,870
Who is the extra one for?

382
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,499
No matter how you calculate it,

383
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,500
only 4 of us can survive.

384
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,880
So, we need to take action first.

385
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,990
I'll deal with the
people in the cargo hold.

386
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,110
You deal with the 2 women.

387
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,540
Be careful.

388
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,160
You can't do this.

389
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,990
I know none of you are good people,

390
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,540
but can you act like humans?

391
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,470
The 2 women are not the biggest problem.

392
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,100
Do you know there's a
bio-soldier in the cargo hold?

393
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,080
He's here to capture the Twins,

394
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,250
and his subordinates are armed.

395
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,180
Do we have any chance

396
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:10,130
against them as just two people?

397
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,280
I can release the air in the container.

398
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:35,350
The bio-soldier can survive
for 30 minutes in a vacuum.

399
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,710
That's enough for him to kill you 3 times.

400
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,220
You must know him.

401
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,760
You definitely know him.

402
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,980
Then it will be solved.

403
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,570
I'll let him live

404
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,280
and he can

405
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,640
deal with those people.

406
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,780
Who gives you the right to decide
the life and death of others here?

407
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,020
This is my spacecraft.

408
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,750
You can't afford to be wrong again.

409
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,180
At least let that little girl live.

410
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,340
I'll choose

411
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:21,900
whoever can let me survive.

412
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,490
Lu Ming,

413
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,600
you can't be soft-hearted now.

414
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,920
Even if we don't take action,

415
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,210
they will end up killing each other.

416
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,420
Right now,

417
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,900
we need to find the person

418
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,170
who can help us survive.

419
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,590
- Drop the gun.
- Drop the gun.

Don't shoot!

422
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,680
We need to figure out
what they've transported.

423
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,239
The spaceship is about to crash,

424
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,450
eject quickly!

There's only 1 escape pod.

426
00:29:37,741 --> 00:29:38,940
Don't worry about me.

427
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,800
Let's go together.

428
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,579
I have to try.

429
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,209
Below lies the protective
shield of Sailor Valley.

430
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,090
If the spaceship crashes into it,

431
00:29:46,091 --> 00:29:47,450
many people will die.

432
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,579
Have you made up your mind?

433
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,329
There are only 2
outcomes, success or failure.

434
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,910
Don't overthink it.

If

you were to descend from the sky

onto that doomed spaceship

438
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,390

How would you choose?

444
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,780
It's very difficult, right?

445
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,450
Because any choice would be wrong.

and I can't claim to be a good person.

448

I'll just choose someone I like.

471
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,089
if I had abandoned the ship a bit later,

472
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:44,020
things might have been different?

473
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:49,750
This time, let's see

474
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,280
if it can be different.

475
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,200
It's all your fault.

476
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,410
In the past,

477
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,819
: all the passengers on the ships
trapped in the Star Abyss disappeared

478
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:06,320
because they killed each other to survive.

479
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,530
Now, on our ship,

480
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,980
there are also 2 killers

481
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,810
wanting to go down the same path.

482
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,469
But as long as everyone works
together, believes in each other,

483
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,210
and stops their plan,

484
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,320
we can definitely find

485
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:22,170
a way for everyone to survive.

486
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:33,329
As long as we release
the monster, kill the others,

487
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:35,480
and then lower the oxygen levels,

488
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,300
the two of us can survive.

489
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:58,870

must be hiding something.

507
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,370
Zhanhui!

508
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,579
Don't scare me, Zhanhui.

509
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,620
Where are you, Zhanhui?

510
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:18,620
Zhanhui.

511
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,200
Zhanhui.

512
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,700
Su Li.

513
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,830
Zhanhui!

514
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,500
Come out,

515
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,500
or else I'll shoot.

516
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,540
Walk over slowly.

517
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,690
Don't shoot!

518
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,800
I just want to survive.

519
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,540
Give me a reason not to kill you.

520
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:35,220
Because I have 4 hibernation pods.

521
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,820
You need me.

522
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,040
What is that?

523
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,160
Look.

524
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:44,860
It's Su Li.

525
00:37:44,861 --> 00:37:46,489
Mom, what are you doing? Come back!

526
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:47,160
Mom!

527
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,539
- Mom!
- Come back!

528
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,200
Mom!

529
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:50,540
- Sit down.
- Mom.

530
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,670
Be quiet!

531
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,870
What's going on?

532
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,200
It's so scary.

533
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,160
Mom.

534
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,640
[Mrs. Star Seeker]

535
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,909
[Mrs. Star Seeker]

536
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:19,739
The Twins must be smuggling
genetically engineered monster.

537
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,540
Not only can it optically cloak,

538
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,539
but it can also
automatically repair wounds.

539
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,790
No matter what it is,

540
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,160
if it doesn't die, we will.

541
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,770
[Mrs. Star Seeker]

542
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,789
Du Xiao!

543
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,450
You fool, run!

544
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:58,050
Du Xiao!

545
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,370
She's already dead.

546
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,040
This is a trap.

547
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,079
Go! Another one is dead!

548
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,790
Go!

549
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:16,550
[Mrs. Star Seeker]

550
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:21,290
Go, Duo! Hurry!

551
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:26,950
Help!

552
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,300
Help me!

553
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,950
Calm down.

554
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:49,040
It wants to kill us all.

555
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,850
Let's get out of here first.

556
00:39:58,790 --> 00:39:59,989
Cut off the head of the snake.

557
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,119
I'll go and find the Twins.

558
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,300
You stay here.

559
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,579
This monster is optically cloaked.

560
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,669
Once the torch is lit,

561
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,929
you'll be able to see it.

562
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:13,460
[Mrs. Star Seeker]

563
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,620
No more wasting time with them.

564
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,100
I'll remote control the monster directly.

565
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:28,950
Oh, right.

566
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,339
Don't kill that female
crew member just yet.

567
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,829
I still need her help

568
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,630
to modify the hibernation pods.

569
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,830
They'll soon know what a nightmare is.

570
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,690
Fujimoto, you bastard!

571
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:53,539
You bought these death-trap
tickets just to save money.

572
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,740
You're going to kill us all!

573
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:56,990
Zi.

574
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,700
I have a family to support,
and I have you to support.

575
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,700
Run.

576
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:17,580
What are you doing?

577
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,950
The monster's in here.

578
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,290
Why is it here?

579
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,480
I don't know.

580
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,879
Everyone else is in the cargo bay passage.

581
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,180
I'll take care of it.

582
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,440
You go deal with the bio-soldier.

583
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,080
I'll go deal with that bio-soldier.

584
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,220
Hey, keep the female crew

585
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,420
alive.

586
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,999
As long as she's alive,

587
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,120
correct?

588
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,250
It's coming.

589
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:28,700
Fire!

590
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,830
It's injured.

591
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:09,279
Take the others to the circulation chamber.

592
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,130
I'll stay here and kill it.

593
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,090
Xing Tian.

594
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,510
Originally, catching you requires evidence.

595
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,490
Now it's easy.

596
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,200
Wearing armor is cheating, is it?

597
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:57,990
Is it still easy now?

598
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:27,910
Run!

599
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:59,740
This is the secret to your immortality
as bio-soldiers.

600
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,630
Not only can I heal my wounds,

601
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:07,120
I can also...

602
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:16,920
How to kill that monster?

603
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:18,410
Tell me!

604
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:26,380
Go! Go!

605
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:29,790
Hurry!

606
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,730
The monster is catching up!

607
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:34,990
Grandma!

608
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:41,100
The door's broken. It won't lock.

609
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:42,660
Grandma.

610
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,750
Go!

611
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:45,960
We can't all die here.

612
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:48,330
Hurry up.

613
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:49,739
They can't die in vain.

614
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:50,790
Go!

615
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:52,040
Grandma!

616
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:53,250
Grandma!

617
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:54,459
Go. Hurry up.

618
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,670
Grandma!

619
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:58,140
Grandma!

620
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:02,640
To kill the monster,

621
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:05,290
you'll need the neurotoxin we've got.

622
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:06,970
Hand it over.

623
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:10,920
There's only one.

624
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,410
It's not here with me.

625
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:14,210
And.

626
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:30,700
Hurry up.

627
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:33,140
I can't hold on for long.

628
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:34,870
But I can still hold the door.

629
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:35,770
Without you,

630
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,480
those two girls won't make it out alive.

631
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,950
Leave now!

632
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:40,280
What is this?

633
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:42,389
This is military-grade nanite injection

634
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:44,039
that I extracted from myself.

635
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,170
No matter how heavily wounded you are,

636
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:48,990
as long as you're not
dead, it can heal you.

637
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:50,540
What about you?

638
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:54,170
What will you do if you get injured again?

639
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:56,539
Treat your injuries first.

640
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,540
If the monster doesn't die, we will.

641
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:02,250
You've got to survive for her sake.

642
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,049
This is the surveillance video
from back then.

643
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:20,710
With this, you can prove your innocence.

644
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:34,620
Let's go together.

645
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:36,489
I have to give it a try.

646
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:38,119
Below is the protective shield
of the Sailor Valley.

647
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:38,990
If the spaceship hits it,

648
00:48:38,991 --> 00:48:40,480
many people will die.

649
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:41,490
Have you made up your mind?

650
00:48:41,491 --> 00:48:44,409
There are only two possible outcomes,
success or failure.

651
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:46,330
What good is this to me now?

652
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:51,400
At least you can explain things clearly
to the girl.

653
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:56,110
Screw you!

654
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:09,910
If I die,

655
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,700
you have to let Ji Ya and Duo live.

656
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:39,789
Ji Ya went to the circulation chamber.

657
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:40,910
You go get her.

658
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,300
You won't make me go
empty-handed, will you?

659
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:49,370
A woman and two kids.

660
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:51,230
What a tough task.

661
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:58,170
Alright.

662
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:03,910
I've put all my bets on you guys.

663
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:05,870
Don't let me down.

664
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:11,360
For the bio-soldier,

665
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:13,560
we need to take him on together.

666
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:17,470
This neurotoxin can take down the monster

667
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:20,070
and it will definitely work on him as well.

668
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:33,320
[Mrs. Star Seeker cargo spacecraft,
circulation chamber]

669
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:37,910
Tingting.

670
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,030
Duo.

671
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:49,330
It's alright.

672
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:51,470
Everything is fine.

673
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:53,710
I'm here. Don't worry.

674
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:55,910
It's okay.

675
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,290
Someone is coming.

676
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,270
Get up.

677
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:03,240
You go first.

678
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:04,170
Hurry up.

679
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:05,560
Go! Be careful.

680
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:32,370
Come out.

681
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:36,240
Do you think I don't know
how big this place is?

682
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,290
Go!

683
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:38,040
Hurry up!

684
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:41,240
Tingting is injured.

685
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,620
She's bleeding.

686
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:56,659
Let's go. Take her away.

687
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:57,700
You go first.

688
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,040
Go. Go.

689
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:02,210
Go!

690
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,120
Be quick!

691
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:15,490
Hang in there.

692
00:54:15,491 --> 00:54:17,290
Lu Ming will come to save us.

693
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,160
No one

694
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:07,220
can decide how I live

695
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:08,750
or how I die.

696
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:19,470
Leave them to me.

697
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:22,279
That monster is being controlled
by the Twins.

698
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,870
Once I take them down,

699
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:26,020
you'll be able to blow that monster up.

700
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:30,920
This...

701
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,270
I hope you won't need it.

702
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:51,790
Hey.

703
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:53,620
Stay alive.

704
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,390
You too.

705
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,340
As long as you survive,

706
00:55:58,380 --> 00:55:59,830
you'll be free.

707
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,770
I'll see you in the nacelle.

708
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,040
Hurry up.

709
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:30,700
Duo!

710
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:31,990
Duo!

711
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:34,740
Duo!

712
00:57:34,741 --> 00:57:36,240
Help!

713
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:37,540
Duo.

714
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:56,910
Warning.

715
00:57:56,911 --> 00:57:58,539
Artificial gravity is off,

716
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:00,830
entering weightless state.

717
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:35,789
Warning.

718
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:37,450
Artificial gravity is on.

719
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,040
Warning.

720
00:58:40,041 --> 00:58:41,829
Artificial gravity is off,

721
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:44,040

Artificial gravity is on.

724
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:42,119
If you weren't valuable,

725
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,110
I'd love to dismember you for free.

726
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,670
I may have lost,

727
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:54,830
but

728
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:56,800
you didn't win either.

729
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:27,120
Ji Ya!

730
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:28,820
Ji Ya!

731
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:30,830
Duo.

732
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,330
Uncle!

733
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:55,729
Let me go, you old bastard.

734
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:57,060
What are you looking at?

735
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:07,400
I, this old bastard,

736
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,920
have a daughter too.

737
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,610
This is a photo of my
daughter 30 years ago.

738
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:21,490
At that time,

739
01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:24,550
We two talked about everything.

740
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:28,190
She trusted me the most.

741
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:33,280
But now,

742
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:36,620
I don't know where she is,

743
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:40,590
what kind of life she's living,

744
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:44,770
or what she looks like.

745
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,280
Don't you think it's cruel?

746
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:02,740
Cruel?

747
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:07,910
I think that's not nearly enough for you.

748
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:12,960
What did you say?

749
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:14,750
Get up.

750
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:16,740
Go.

751
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:17,800
Go.

752
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:21,770
I'm fine.

753
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:25,750
I lost the necklace,

754
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:28,330
and Ji Ya was taken away.

755
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,580
Only those who risked their lives

756
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,749
to rescue their comrades on the battlefield

757
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:36,880
are eligible to receive this medal.

758
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:39,870
Your parents gave this to you,

759
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:42,820
hoping that you would grow up
safe and sound.

760
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:49,120
Don't lose it again.

761
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:03,820
Let's go!

762
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:21,360
Come back!

763
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:24,869
There's a hatch over here.

764
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:25,910
A hatch.

765
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:28,030
Come on.

766
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:29,910
Let's go.

767
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:34,460
Duo, over there.

768
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:36,030
Let's go to the nacelle.

769
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:56,320
[Mrs. Star Seeker
cargo spacecraft, nacelle]

770
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:15,959
This is the airlock chamber.

771
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:16,790
Beyond that is the vacuum.

772
01:04:16,791 --> 01:04:18,080
There's no way out.

773
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:22,829
I've activated the rescue signal.

774
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:24,869
Someone will definitely get you out later.

775
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:26,039
The hatch will open from the inside,

776
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:26,820
but you'll be safe.

777
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:28,030
What about you?

778
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,200
If you're injured,

779
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:32,239
it will save your life.

780
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,339
But you're already injured.

781
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:34,990
Take it. Don't lose it.

782
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:38,570
Hurry up.

783
01:04:38,590 --> 01:04:40,050
I'll definitely block it.

784
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:43,130
You must survive, no matter what.

785
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:48,760
Duo.

786
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:51,380
I have to tell you something.

787
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:57,630
I got 80,000 people in Sailor Valley

788
01:04:58,550 --> 01:05:00,090
and your parents killed.

789
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:05,660
I'm sorry.

790
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,949
Thank goodness you still remember

791
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:04,019
I can survive in the vacuum for 30 minutes.

792
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:06,080
I came here as soon as I saw the signal.

793
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:08,410
I thought you were lost.

794
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:10,449
Don't worry. She just needs some air.

795
01:06:10,450 --> 01:06:11,960
She will wake up soon.

796
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:52,890
Move.

797
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:07,280
What's wrong?

798
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:10,680
She went into a coma due to a brain injury.

799
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:12,589
I have to reconnect with the monster

800
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:13,870
to wake her up.

801
01:07:16,790 --> 01:07:17,940
What should we do?

802
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:21,900
The pilot and the bio-soldier are alive.

803
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:23,360
If you don't help me,

804
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,140
you are a dead man.

805
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:28,340
Fine.

806
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,080
What do you want?

807
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,480
This is a neurotoxin.

808
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,309
Inject it into the monster's body.

809
01:07:37,310 --> 01:07:38,470
After sedating it,

810
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:40,630
we can reconnect with it.

811
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:42,330
Then I can wake her up.

812
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:25,619
My leg!

813
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:46,199
You had your chance,

814
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,630
and you wasted it.

815
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:02,260
Seems like I bet on the wrong person.

816
01:09:03,949 --> 01:09:05,130
But luckily,

817
01:09:06,070 --> 01:09:07,409
I have this.

818
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:15,210
Warning.

819
01:09:15,230 --> 01:09:17,550
Patient's condition is critical.

820
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:19,710
What are you doing?

821
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:21,270
Warning.

822
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:23,560
Patient's condition is critical.

823
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:25,460
I have survived thus far

824
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,739
not by luck.

825
01:09:49,150 --> 01:09:50,279
What are you doing?

826
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,530
The Captain just killed Twins.

827
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:56,920
Now,

828
01:09:57,910 --> 01:09:59,450
he has the neurotoxin.

829
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:02,820
This is the only way to kill the monster.

830
01:10:08,450 --> 01:10:10,660
There are only five of us left.

831
01:10:12,150 --> 01:10:13,110
Lu Ming,

832
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:16,020
if you want those three to survive,

833
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:18,980
you have to kill the monster.

834
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:20,530
Otherwise,

835
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:22,180
everyone will die.

836
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:26,460
It's your choice.

837
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:56,510
[Mrs. Star Seeker]

838
01:10:59,370 --> 01:11:02,450
So your kind can also die from bleeding.

839
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:03,979
You best behave yourself.

840
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:06,180
Don't waste the chance Lu Ming gave you.

841
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:08,790
Don't let me see you again.

842
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:22,940
It's your time to shine.

843
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:26,070
Reboot the AI system immediately.

844
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,280
Everything

845
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,460
will be over soon.

846
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:03,090
Come here!

847
01:12:08,830 --> 01:12:11,370
I'm going to tear you apart!

848
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:15,720
If I had hung on a little longer last time,

849
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,820
those people wouldn't have died.

850
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:19,830
This time,

851
01:12:19,950 --> 01:12:21,700
I won't give up.

852
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,050
Come on!

853
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:00,450
You will die.

854
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:03,490
Everyone will die.

855
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,160
Do you regret it?

856
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:16,209
I hope you won't need it.

857
01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:18,120
System reboot completed,

858
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:20,240
starting automatic detection.

859
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:07,860
I already know your answer.

860
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,950
Do you want to know mine?

861
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,880
I'll let that wounded soldier take my place

862
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:15,860
and escape with the commander.

863
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:18,740
Then I will stay,

864
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:22,500
together with the pilot who has saved many,

865
01:15:23,450 --> 01:15:25,940
to save more people.

866
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:37,380
If you get hurt,

867
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:38,660
it can save your life.

868
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:42,460
Hold onto it. Don't lose it.

869
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:09,950
He's dead.

870
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:11,580
He won't feel anything.

871
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:15,870
There are only

872
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:17,850
four people left on the ship.

873
01:16:19,830 --> 01:16:21,120
Just accept it.

874
01:16:21,550 --> 01:16:23,010
AI doesn't make mistakes.

875
01:16:23,450 --> 01:16:26,290
Just let the kid do something for him.

876
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:51,920
You must believe in hope.

877
01:16:58,410 --> 01:16:59,280
Let's go.

878
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:49,660
We will surely see him again.

879
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:55,550
It's your turn.

880
01:18:07,710 --> 01:18:10,040
I wish you can hear their screams

881
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:12,480
every night from now on.

882
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:18,880
In this world,

883
01:18:18,930 --> 01:18:20,960
it's easy to forget.

884
01:18:22,410 --> 01:18:24,960
I don't want to live in such a world.

885
01:21:34,580 --> 01:21:36,210
When you wake up,

886
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:39,260
the first thing you see will be good news.

887
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:10,650
I'll let that wounded soldier take my place

888
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:12,480
and escape with the commander.

889
01:23:12,510 --> 01:23:14,260
Then I will stay,

890
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:17,290
together with the pilot who has saved many,

891
01:23:17,330 --> 01:23:19,830
to save more people.

892
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:03,530
[Star Abyss]

893
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,410
Hi, Duo.

894
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:30,449
When you wake up,

895
01:24:30,450 --> 01:24:31,699
I'll be seven years older,

896
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:33,910
but you're still seven. Isn't it fun?

897
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:37,409
There's nothing fun on this ship.

898
01:24:37,410 --> 01:24:39,330
So you didn't miss anything.

899
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:42,790
Xing Tian.

900
01:24:42,791 --> 01:24:43,920
You brat.

901
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:45,920
See? I planted them all.

902
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:48,489
I'm the only one left on the plane.

903
01:24:48,490 --> 01:24:50,199
By lowering the air oxygen level,

904
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,820
I can live for seven years.

905
01:24:51,850 --> 01:24:53,969
It's like I've been living

906
01:24:53,970 --> 01:24:56,159
at high altitude with low oxygen level.

907
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:57,490
I'll get used to it soon.

908
01:24:57,610 --> 01:24:58,980
Old man,

909
01:24:59,730 --> 01:25:01,590
some of them found their way home,

910
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:03,680
some regained their freedom,

911
01:25:03,710 --> 01:25:05,370
and some restored their hope.

912
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:06,870
But what about you?

913
01:25:07,550 --> 01:25:09,180
I hope when you go to jail,

914
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:11,040
your daughter will visit you.

915
01:25:14,050 --> 01:25:15,630
Ji Ya,

916
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:18,020
although

917
01:25:18,690 --> 01:25:20,640
you thought I was dead at that time,

918
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:23,410
yet

919
01:25:24,530 --> 01:25:26,210
I still heard it.

920
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,250
I'm very glad

921
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:31,210
to hear your answer.

922
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:35,580
The reason I kept going

923
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:39,050
is that I want to tell
you one day in person

924
01:25:39,630 --> 01:25:41,630
that we made the right choice.

925
01:25:43,910 --> 01:25:44,750
Duo,

926
01:25:45,330 --> 01:25:47,240
I heard what you said as well.

927
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:48,960
Never

928
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,830
lose hope.

929
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:54,550
No matter what,

930
01:25:55,110 --> 01:25:56,800
I will hold on,

931
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:59,570
because I promised you.

932
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:06,100
See you in the new world.
