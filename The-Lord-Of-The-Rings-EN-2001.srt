1
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,870
<i>The world is changed.</i>

2
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,080
<i>I feel it in the water.</i>

3
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,760
<i>I feel it in the earth.</i>

4
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,320
<i>I smell it in the air.</i>

5
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,630
<i>Much that once was...</i>

6
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,390
<i>...is lost.</i>

7
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,130
<i>For none now live who remember it.</i>

8
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:14,420
<i>It began with the forging
of the Great Rings.</i>

9
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,520
<i>Three were given to the Elves:</i>

10
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,490
<i>Immortal, wisest and fairest
of all beings.</i>

11
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,620
<i>Seven to the Dwarf-lords:</i>

12
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,800
<i>Great miners and craftsmen
of the mountain halls.</i>

13
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,500
<i>And nine...</i>

14
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,700
<i>...nine rings were gifted
to the race of Men...</i>

15
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,770
<i>...who, above all else, desire power.</i>

16
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,110
<i>For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race.</i>

17
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,780
<i>But they were all of them deceived.</i>

18
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,120
<i>For another ring was made.</i>

19
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,520
<i>In the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom...</i>

20
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,400
<i>...the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a Master Ring...</i>

21
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,660
<i>...to control all others.</i>

22
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,830
<i>And into this Ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...</i>

23
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,240
<i>...and his will to dominate all life.</i>

24
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,110
<i>One Ring to rule them all.</i>

25
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,610
<i>One by one...</i>

26
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:23,480
<i>...the Free Lands of Middle-earth
fell to the power of the Ring.</i>

27
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,720
<i>But there were some who resisted.</i>

28
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:31,860
<i>A Last Alliance of Men and Elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.</i>

29
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,700
<i>And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.</i>

30
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,660
<i>Victory was near.</i>

31
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,170
<i>But the power of the Ring...</i>

32
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,410
<i>...could not be undone.</i>

33
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,940
<i>It was in this moment...</i>

34
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,500
<i>...when all hope had faded...</i>

35
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,840
<i>...that Isildûr, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.</i>

36
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:29,440
<i>Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated.</i>

37
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,480
<i>The Ring passed to Isildûr...</i>

38
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,890
<i>...who had this one chance
to destroy evil forever.</i>

39
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,760
<i>But the hearts of Men...</i>

40
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,460
<i>...are easily corrupted.</i>

41
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,330
<i>And the Ring of Power
has a will of its own.</i>

42
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,160
<i>It betrayed Isildûr...</i>

43
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,400
<i>...to his death.</i>

44
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,440
<i>And some things
that should not have been forgotten...</i>

45
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,010
<i>...were lost.</i>

46
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,040
<i>History became legend...</i>

47
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,240
<i>...legend became myth.</i>

48
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,360
<i>And for
two and a half thousand years...</i>

49
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,220
<i>...the Ring passed
out of all knowledge.</i>

50
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,690
<i>Until, when chance came...</i>

51
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,460
<i>...it ensnared a new bearer.</i>

52
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,640
My precious.

53
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,430
<i>The Ring came to the creature
Gollum...</i>

54
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,550
<i>...who took it deep into the tunnels
of the Misty Mountains.</i>

55
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,720
<i>And there it consumed him.</i>

56
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,940
It came to me.

57
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:18,590
My own. My love. My own.

58
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:23,490
My precious.

59
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,570
<i>The Ring brought to Gollum
unnatural long life.</i>

60
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,600
<i>For 500 years it poisoned his mind.</i>

61
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:39,400
<i>And in the gloom of Gollum's cave,
it waited.</i>

62
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,880
<i>Darkness crept back
into the forests of the world.</i>

63
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,950
<i>Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...</i>

64
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,950
<i>...whispers of a nameless fear.</i>

65
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,450
<i>And the Ring of Power perceived...</i>

66
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,460
<i>...its time had now come.</i>

67
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,530
<i>It abandoned Gollum.</i>

68
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,690
<i>But something happened then
the Ring did not intend.</i>

69
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:11,140
<i>It was picked up by the most unlikely
creature imaginable.</i>

70
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,400
What's this?

71
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,050
<i>A Hobbit.</i>

72
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,980
<i>Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.</i>

73
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,950
A ring.

74
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,020
Lost!

75
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:27,230
My precious is lost!

76
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,720
<i>For the time will soon come...</i>

77
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,160
<i>...when Hobbits will shape
the fortunes of all.</i>

78
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,000
The 22nd day of September...

79
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,410
...in the year 1400...

80
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,880
...by Shire-reckoning.

81
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:54,850
Bag End, Bagshot Row, Hobbiton,
Westfarthing...

82
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,050
...the Shire...

83
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,060
...Middle-earth.

84
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,030
The Third Age of this world.

85
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,570
<i>There and Back Again:</i>

86
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,950
<i>A Hobbit's Tale.</i>

87
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,060
By Bilbo Baggins.

88
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,620
Now...

89
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,350
...where to begin?

90
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,690
Ah, yes...

91
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,040
"Concerning...

92
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,730
...Hobbits."

93
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,410
<i>Hobbits have been living and farming
in the four Farthings of the Shire...</i>

94
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,570
<i>...for many hundreds of years...</i>

95
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,720
<i>...quite content to ignore
and be ignored...</i>

96
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,080
<i>...by the world of the Big Folk.</i>

97
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:10,090
<i>Middle-earth being, after all,
full of strange creatures beyond count...</i>

98
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,460
<i>...Hobbits must seem
of little importance...</i>

99
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,660
<i>...being neither renowned
as great warriors...</i>

100
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,040
<i>...nor counted among the very wise.</i>

101
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:29,400
Frodo! Someone at the door.

102
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,180
<i>In fact, it has been remarked by some...</i>

103
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:37,790
<i>...that Hobbits' only real passion
is for food.</i>

104
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,350
<i>A rather unfair observation...</i>

105
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,190
<i>...as we have also developed a keen
interest in the brewing of ales...</i>

106
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,360
<i>...and the smoking of pipe-weed.</i>

107
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,670
<i>But where our hearts truly lie...</i>

108
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,960
<i>...is in peace and quiet...</i>

109
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,870
<i>...and good, tilled earth.</i>

110
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,210
<i>For all Hobbits share a love
of things that grow.</i>

111
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,790
<i>And, yes, no doubt to others,
our ways seem quaint.</i>

112
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:14,190
<i>But today of all days,
it is brought home to me:</i>

113
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:20,730
<i>It is no bad thing
to celebrate a simple life.</i>

114
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,100
Frodo, the door!

115
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,850
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

116
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,710
Frodo!

117
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,050
<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

118
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,630
<i>And I must follow if I can</i>

119
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,730
<i>The road goes ever on and on</i>

120
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,400
<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

121
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,580
<i>Now far ahead the road has gone</i>

122
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,010
<i>-And I must follow if I can</i>
-You're late.

123
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:19,090
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

124
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:24,520
Nor is he early. He arrives
precisely when he means to.

125
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,940
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

126
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,550
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

127
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,380
So how is the old rascal?

128
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,450
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

129
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,100
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole place in an uproar.

130
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,230
Well, that should please him.

131
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,260
Half the Shire's been invited.

132
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,130
And the rest of them are turning up
anyway.

133
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,640
<i>And so life in the Shire goes on...</i>

134
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,840
<i>...very much as it has
this past Age...</i>

135
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:19,580
<i>...full of its own comings and goings,
with change coming slowly.</i>

136
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,650
<i>If it comes at all.</i>

137
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,360
<i>For things are made to endure
in the Shire...</i>

138
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:30,020
<i>...passing from one generation
to the next.</i>

139
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:35,420
<i>There's always been a Baggins
living here under the Hill...</i>

140
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,970
<i>...in Bag End.</i>

141
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,500
And there always will be.

142
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,640
To tell you the truth,
Bilbo's been a bit odd lately.

143
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,110
I mean, more than usual.

144
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,020
He's taken to locking himself
in his study.

145
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,780
<i>He spends hours and hours poring over
old maps when he thinks I'm not looking.</i>

146
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,170
Where's it gone?

147
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,060
He's up to something.

148
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,700
-All right, then. Keep your secrets.
-What?

149
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,610
But I know you have something
to do with it.

150
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,900
Good gracious me.

151
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,110
Before you came along, we Bagginses
were very well thought of.

152
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,220
Indeed.

153
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,750
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

154
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,230
If you're referring to the incident
with the dragon, I was barely involved.

155
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:13,020
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

156
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,330
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

157
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,570
Oh, really?

158
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,210
Gandalf! Gandalf!

159
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,580
Fireworks, Gandalf!

160
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,280
-Gandalf!
-Fireworks, Gandalf!

161
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,170
Gandalf?

162
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,880
-I'm glad you're back.
-So am I, dear boy.

163
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,120
So am I.

164
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,390
No, thank you!

165
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,520
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

166
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:52,220
And what about very old friends?

167
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,130
Gandalf?

168
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:01,230
-Bilbo Baggins.
-My dear Gandalf!

169
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:06,570
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

170
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,340
You haven't aged a day.

171
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,990
Come on, come in!

172
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,560
Welcome, welcome.

173
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,250
Oh, here we are.

174
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,400
Tea? Or maybe something
a little stronger?

175
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:33,370
I've got a few bottles
of the Old Winyard left. 1296.

176
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:37,600
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

177
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,270
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

178
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,110
Just tea, thank you.

179
00:16:49,954 --> 00:16:52,400
Oh!

180
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,190
I was expecting you sometime
last week.

181
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:57,690
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

182
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,388
You caught me a bit unprepared I'm afraid.

183
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,188
We've only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle...

184
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,160
There's some cheese here.
Oh no, that won't do.

185
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:10,810
We've got raspberry jam,
an apple tart...

186
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:15,500
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.

187
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,550
I've just found some sponge cake.

188
00:17:21,097 --> 00:17:23,097
I could make you some eggs
if you'd--

189
00:17:23,154 --> 00:17:25,360
Oh, Gandalf?

190
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:29,250
-Just tea, thank you.
-Oh, right.

191
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,660
-You don't mind if I eat, do you?
-Oh no, not at all.

192
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,630
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

193
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,430
I'm not at home!

194
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,040
It's the Sackville-Bagginses.

195
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,300
-I know you're in there!
-They're after the house.

196
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,470
They've never forgiven me
for living this long.

197
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,480
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...

198
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,620
...never giving me a moment's peace.

199
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,850
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!

200
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:05,620
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

201
00:18:06,034 --> 00:18:07,771
So you mean to go through with your

202
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,920
-plan then?
-Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

203
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,170
All the arrangements are made.

204
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,770
Oh, thank you.

205
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,640
Frodo suspects something.

206
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,280
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

207
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,110
...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle
from Hardbottle.

208
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,450
You will tell him, won't you?

209
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,350
-Yes, yes.
-He's very fond of you.

210
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,120
I know.

211
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,830
He'd probably come with me
if I asked him.

212
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:43,870
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the Shire.

213
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,800
The woods, the fields.

214
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,310
Little rivers.

215
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,480
I am old, Gandalf.

216
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:04,120
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

217
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,820
I feel thin.

218
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,371
Sort of stretched like...

219
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,330
...butter scraped
over too much bread.

220
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:20,000
I need a holiday. A very long holiday.

221
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:23,400
And I don't expect I shall return.

222
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,840
In fact, I mean not to.

223
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,580
Old Toby. The finest weed
in the Southfarthing.

224
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,530
Gandalf, my old friend...

225
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,540
...this will be a night to remember.

226
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,430
Hello, hello.

227
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,730
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

228
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:30,300
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

229
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:36,470
-I think I'll just have another ale.
-Oh, no, you don't.

230
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,310
Go on!

231
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,290
So there I was...

232
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,590
...at the mercy
of three monstrous trolls.

233
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,760
And they were all arguing
amongst themselves...

234
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,340
...about how they were
going to cook us.

235
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,965
Whether it be turned on a spit,

236
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:06,050
or whether they should sit on us
one by one, squash us into jelly.

237
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,140
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

238
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,940
...that the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...

239
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,440
...and turned them all to stone!

240
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,130
Quickly.

241
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,330
Up they go!

242
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,400
No, the big one.

243
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,480
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

244
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,550
Are all these children yours?

245
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,710
Good gracious,
you have been productive.

246
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,060
Bilbo?

247
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,520
Sackville-Bagginses!

248
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,790
Quickly, hide!

249
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:11,870
Thank you, my boy.

250
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,710
You're a good lad, Frodo.

251
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,820
I'm very selfish, you know.

252
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,710
Yes, I am. Very selfish.

253
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,290
I don't know why I took you in after
your mother and father died...

254
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,890
...but it wasn't out of charity.

255
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,930
I think it was because...

256
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,430
...of all my numerous relations...

257
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:36,220
...you were the one Baggins
that showed real spirit.

258
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,330
Bilbo, have you been
at the Gaffer's home brew?

259
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,230
No.

260
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,130
Well, yes, but that's not the point.

261
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,610
The point is, Frodo...

262
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,710
...you'll be all right.

263
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:57,150
-Done!
-You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

264
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,820
-It is in the ground.
-Outside!

265
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,550
This was your idea.

266
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,930
Bilbo.

267
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,782
-Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!
-Dragon?

268
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,450
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for a thousand years.

269
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:42,530
-That was good.
-Let's get another one.

270
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,360
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

271
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,440
I might've known.

272
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,410
Speech, Bilbo!

273
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,620
Speech!

274
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,810
Speech!

275
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,320
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

276
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:12,320
...Tooks and Brandybucks...

277
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,990
...Grubbs, Chubbs...

278
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,220
...Hornblowers...

279
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,060
...Bolgers...

280
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,000
...Bracegirdles...

281
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,830
-...and Proudfoots.
-Proudfeet!

282
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:29,170
Today is my 111th birthday!

283
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,510
Happy birthday!

284
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,020
But alas, eleventy-one years is
far too short a time to live among...

285
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:40,090
...such excellent
and admirable Hobbits.

286
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,760
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

287
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,560
...and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

288
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,910
I have things to do.

289
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,410
I've put this off far too long.

290
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,220
I regret to announce this is the end!

291
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,560
I'm going now.

292
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,570
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

293
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,130
Goodbye.

294
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:03,530
I suppose you think
that was terribly clever.

295
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:07,110
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

296
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,050
There are many magic rings in this world,
Bilbo Baggins,

297
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,530
and none of them should be used lightly.

298
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,680
It was just a bit of fun.

299
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:18,620
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

300
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:23,550
-You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
-Two eyes.

301
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,420
As often as I can spare them.

302
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:29,790
-I'm leaving everything to him.
-What about this ring of yours?

303
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,330
-Is that staying too?
-Yes, yes.

304
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:37,840
It's in an envelope over there
on the mantelpiece.

305
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,880
No. Wait, it's...

306
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,110
...here in my pocket.

307
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:54,960
Isn't that--? Isn't that odd, now?

308
00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:00,120
Yet, after all, why not?

309
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,440
Why shouldn't I keep it?

310
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,440
I think you should
leave the ring behind, Bilbo.

311
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:09,170
Is that so hard?

312
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,670
Well, no.

313
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,600
And yes.

314
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:19,640
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel like parting with it.

315
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,610
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

316
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:26,020
-There's no need to get angry.
-Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

317
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:28,250
It's mine.

318
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:32,020
My own.

319
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,360
-My precious.
-Precious?

320
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,400
It's been called that before,
but not by you.

321
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:42,200
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

322
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,170
I think you've had that ring
quite long enough.

323
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:48,210
-You want it for yourself!
-Bilbo Baggins!

324
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:52,680
Do not take me for some conjurer
of cheap tricks.

325
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,550
I am not trying to rob you.

326
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,250
I'm trying to help you.

327
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,070
All your long years,
we've been friends.

328
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,600
Trust me as you once did.

329
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,310
Let it go.

330
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,880
You're right, Gandalf.

331
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:29,680
The ring must go to Frodo.

332
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:33,960
It's late. The road is long.

333
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,680
Yes, it is time.

334
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:44,460
Bilbo, the ring is still in your pocket.

335
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:22,230
I've thought up an ending for my book:

336
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,870
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

337
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:32,480
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

338
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,990
Goodbye, Gandalf.

339
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:40,360
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

340
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:52,400
<i>The road goes ever on and on</i>

341
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,834
<i>Down from the door where...</i>

342
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,370
Until our next meeting.

343
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:28,370
<i>It's mine. My own.</i>

344
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:32,000
<i>My precious.</i>

345
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,180
Riddles in the dark.

346
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,850
Bilbo!

347
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,540
Bilbo!

348
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:45,120
My precious.

349
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,950
Precious.

350
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,690
He's gone, hasn't he?

351
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:57,530
He talked for so long about leaving...

352
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,430
...I didn't think he'd really do it.

353
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,840
Gandalf?

354
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,750
Bilbo's ring.

355
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:19,450
He's gone to stay with the Elves.

356
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,750
He's left you Bag End.

357
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,920
Along with all his possessions.

358
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,000
The ring is yours now.

359
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:38,100
-Put it somewhere out of sight.
-Where are you going?

360
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,570
-There are some things that I must see to.
-What things?

361
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:45,010
-Questions. Questions that need answering.
-You've only just arrived.

362
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,510
I don't understand.

363
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,880
Neither do I.

364
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,460
Keep it secret.

365
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,430
Keep it safe.

366
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,560
<i>Shire!</i>

367
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:41,000
<i>Baggins!</i>

368
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:32,490
<i>"The year 3434 of the Second Age.</i>

369
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:37,060
<i>Here follows the account of Isildûr,
High King of Gondor...</i>

370
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,930
<i>...and the finding
of the Ring of Power."</i>

371
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,270
<i>"It has come to me.</i>

372
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,940
<i>The One Ring. It shall be
an heirloom of my kingdom.</i>

373
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:53,580
<i>All those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate...</i>

374
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:57,580
<i>...for I will risk
no hurt to the Ring.</i>

375
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,270
<i>It is precious to me...</i>

376
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:03,780
<i>...though I buy it with great pain.</i>

377
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:11,120
<i>The markings upon the band
begin to fade.</i>

378
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:16,160
<i>The writing, which at first was as clear
as red flame, has all but disappeared.</i>

379
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,430
<i>A secret now
that only fire can tell."</i>

380
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,950
Shire.

381
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,120
Baggins.

382
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:46,650
There's no Bagginses around here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.

383
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:49,860
That way.

384
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:55,702
<i>Hey ho, to the bottle I go</i>

385
00:34:55,737 --> 00:34:58,100
<i>To heal my heart and drown my woe</i>

386
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,610
<i>Rain may fall and wind may blow</i>

387
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,710
<i>But there still be</i>

388
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,310
<i>Many miles to go</i>

389
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,450
<i>Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain</i>

390
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:08,810
<i>And the stream that falls
From hill to plain</i>

391
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,850
<i>Better than rain or rippling brook</i>

392
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,460
<i>Is a mug of beer inside this Took</i>

393
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:19,690
There's been some strange folk
crossing the Shire.

394
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,000
Dwarves and others of a less
than savory nature.

395
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,870
War is brewing.

396
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,400
The mountains are fair teeming
with goblins.

397
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,230
Far-off tales and children's stories,
that's all that is.

398
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:36,900
You're beginning to sound like that old
Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.

399
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,080
Young Mr. Frodo here,
he's cracking.

400
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,680
And proud of it.

401
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:44,285
-Cheers, Gaffer.
-Aye. Cheers.

402
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,420
Well, it's none of our concern
what goes on beyond our borders.

403
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:52,890
Keep your nose out of trouble,
and no trouble'll come to you.

404
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,500
-Good night, lads.
-Good night.

405
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:03,160
Good night, sweet maiden
of the golden ale.

406
00:36:03,188 --> 00:36:05,710
Boy, mind who you're sweet-talking.

407
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,410
Don't worry, Sam. Rosie knows an idiot
when she sees one.

408
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,640
Does she?

409
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,280
-Good night, Sam.
-Good night, Mister Frodo.

410
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:43,540
Is it secret? Is it safe?

411
00:36:49,154 --> 00:36:50,320
Ah!

412
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,550
What are you doing?

413
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,730
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

414
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,070
It's quite cool.

415
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,340
What can you see?

416
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,520
Can you see anything?

417
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,620
Nothing.

418
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,280
There's nothing.

419
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,850
Wait.

420
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:36,230
There are markings.

421
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,090
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.

422
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:43,870
There are few who can.

423
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:49,280
The language is that of Mordor,
which I will not utter here.

424
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,940
Mordor!

425
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,240
In the common tongue, it says:

426
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:56,940
"One Ring to rule them all...

427
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,490
...One Ring to find them...

428
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,890
...One Ring to bring them all...

429
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,190
...and in the darkness bind them."

430
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,860
This is the One Ring...

431
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:14,330
...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.

432
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:18,570
Taken by Isildûr
from the hand of Sauron himself.

433
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,900
Bilbo found it.

434
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:24,310
-In Gollum's cave.
-Yes.

435
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:29,040
For 60 years, the Ring lay quiet
in Bilbo's keeping...

436
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:32,650
...prolonging his life,
delaying old age.

437
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:37,690
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.

438
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,330
The Ring has awoken.

439
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:43,300
It's heard its master's call.

440
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:47,370
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

441
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,170
No, Frodo.

442
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:59,410
The spirit of Sauron endured.

443
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:04,950
His life force is bound to the Ring,
and the Ring survived.

444
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,420
Sauron has returned.

445
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,420
His Orcs have multiplied.

446
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:14,690
His fortress at Barad-dûr
is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.

447
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:19,630
Sauron needs only this Ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

448
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,900
He is seeking it.

449
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:25,970
Seeking it. All his thought
is bent on it.

450
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:28,910
For the Ring yearns above all else...

451
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:32,550
...to return to the hand
of its master.

452
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,550
They are one...

453
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,810
...the Ring and the Dark Lord.

454
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:39,050
Frodo...

455
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,490
...he must never find it.

456
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,720
All right.

457
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:47,390
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

458
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:50,230
No one knows it's here, do they?

459
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,100
Do they, Gandalf?

460
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:01,580
There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the Ring.

461
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:05,810
I looked everywhere
for the creature Gollum.

462
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,140
But the enemy found him first.

463
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,410
<i>I don't know how long
they tortured him.</i>

464
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:17,080
<i>But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words:</i>

465
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,420
Shire!

466
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,190
Baggins!

467
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,260
Shire.

468
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:26,300
Baggins. But that would
lead them here!

469
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,170
Who goes there?

470
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,140
Take it, Gandalf!

471
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,600
-Take it!
-No, Frodo.

472
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:37,150
-You must take it!
-You cannot offer me this ring!

473
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:40,680
-I'm giving it to you!
-Don't tempt me, Frodo!

474
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,450
I dare not take it.

475
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:47,220
Not even to keep it safe.

476
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:50,350
Understand, Frodo...

477
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:54,660
...I would use this Ring
from a desire to do good.

478
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:05,810
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

479
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,310
-But it cannot stay in the Shire!
-No.

480
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,810
No, it can't.

481
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,520
What must I do?

482
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:24,720
-You must leave. And leave quickly.
-Where? Where do I go?

483
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,190
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

484
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,560
Bree.

485
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:32,530
-What about you?
-I'll be waiting for you...

486
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,210
...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

487
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:39,170
-And the Ring will be safe there?
-I don't know, Frodo.

488
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,330
I don't have any answers.

489
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:48,380
I must see the head of my order. He is
both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

490
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,710
He'll know what to do.

491
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,190
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

492
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:56,880
That name is not safe
outside the Shire.

493
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,860
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

494
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:04,700
I can cut across country
easily enough.

495
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,540
My dear Frodo.

496
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:11,870
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

497
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,940
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

498
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:17,550
And yet, after a hundred years...

499
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,740
...they can still surprise you.

500
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:22,720
Get down.

501
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:32,308
Oh!

502
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:38,274
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

503
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:40,240
I haven't been
dropping no eaves, sir. Honest.

504
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:43,040
I was cutting the grass
under the window there. If you follow me.

505
00:42:43,085 --> 00:42:45,740
A little late for trimming the verge,
don't you think?

506
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:48,780
-I heard raised voices.
-What did you hear? Speak!

507
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,070
Nothing important.

508
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,388
That is, I heard a good deal
about a ring, and a

509
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,920
Dark Lord and something about
the end of the world but--

510
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:59,650
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

511
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,980
No?

512
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,320
Perhaps not.

513
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,000
I've thought of a better use for you.

514
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:13,760
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

515
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:17,470
Be careful, both of you.

516
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,510
The enemy has many spies
in his service:

517
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:23,680
Birds, beasts.

518
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:27,280
Is it safe?

519
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:30,320
Never put it on...

520
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,960
...for the agents of the Dark Lord
will be drawn to its power.

521
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,610
Always remember, Frodo...

522
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:39,290
...the Ring is trying to get back
to its master.

523
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,790
It wants to be found.

524
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:24,570
This is it.

525
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:27,040
This is what?

526
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:29,440
If I take one more step...

527
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:33,850
...it'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

528
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,550
Come on, Sam.

529
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:49,860
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

530
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,200
<i>-"It's a dangerous business,"
-"Frodo. Going out your door.</i>

531
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:58,810
<i>You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet...</i>

532
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:03,170
<i>... there's no knowing where
you might be swept off to."</i>

533
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:18,830
Sam.

534
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:23,430
Wood-elves.

535
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:40,710
They're going to the harbor
beyond the White Towers.

536
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:42,980
To the Grey Havens.

537
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:45,610
They're leaving Middle-earth.

538
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:47,980
Never to return.

539
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:52,990
I don't know why...

540
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:56,100
...it makes me sad.

541
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:02,800
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

542
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,270
Just shut your eyes...

543
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,210
...and imagine you're back
in your own bed...

544
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:12,320
...with a soft mattress
and a lovely feather pillow.

545
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:24,320
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

546
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:27,360
I'm never going to be able
to sleep out here.

547
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,070
Me neither, Sam.

548
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,660
<i>Smoke rises
from the Mountain of Doom.</i>

549
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:05,500
<i>The hour grows late.</i>

550
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:09,230
<i>And Gandalf the Grey
rides to Isengard...</i>

551
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,870
<i>...seeking my counsel.</i>

552
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:16,070
For that is why you have come,
is it not?

553
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,540
My old friend.

554
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:19,410
Saruman.

555
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:27,210
-You are sure of this?
-Beyond any doubt.

556
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:30,360
So the Ring of Power has been found.

557
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:33,720
All these long years,
it was in the Shire.

558
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:37,130
-Under my very nose.
-Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

559
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:42,140
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

560
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:47,070
But we still have time. Time enough
to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

561
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,730
Time?

562
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:52,340
What time do you think we have?

563
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:56,620
Sauron has regained
much of his former strength.

564
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,050
He cannot yet take physical form...

565
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,920
...but his spirit has lost
none of its potency.

566
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:07,660
Concealed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees all.

567
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:14,170
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow,
earth and flesh.

568
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:18,800
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

569
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:24,980
A Great Eye, lidless,
wreathed in flame.

570
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:27,750
The Eye of Sauron.

571
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:30,510
He is gathering all evil to him.

572
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,750
Very soon, he'll have summoned
an army...

573
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,820
...great enough for an assault
upon Middle-earth.

574
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,530
You know this?

575
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,590
How?

576
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:42,830
I have seen it.

577
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:46,460
A palantir is a dangerous tool,
Saruman.

578
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:48,660
Why?

579
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,840
Why should we fear to use it?

580
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,470
They are not all accounted for,
the lost Seeing-stones.

581
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:01,850
We do not know who else
may be watching.

582
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:07,180
The hour is later than you think.

583
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,690
Sauron's forces are already moving.

584
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,690
The Nine have left Minas MorguI.

585
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:16,120
The Nine?

586
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:19,360
They crossed the River Isen
on Midsummer's Eve...

587
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,200
...disguised as riders in black.

588
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:26,380
-They've reached the Shire?
-They will find the Ring.

589
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:30,210
And kill the one who carries it.

590
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:32,200
Frodo!

591
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:49,230
You did not seriously think that a Hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

592
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,760
There are none who can.

593
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:58,040
Against the power of Mordor...

594
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:00,840
...there can be no victory.

595
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:05,980
We must join with him, Gandalf.

596
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:09,580
We must join with Sauron.

597
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,920
It would be wise, my friend.

598
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:16,880
Tell me...

599
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,080
...friend...

600
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:23,620
...when did Saruman the Wise
abandon reason for madness?

601
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:05,440
I gave you the chance of...

602
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:08,640
...aiding me willingly...

603
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:12,980
...but you have elected
the way of pain!

604
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:37,800
Mr. Frodo?

605
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:40,170
Frodo? Frodo!

606
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:44,840
-I thought I'd lost you.
-What are you talking about?

607
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:48,010
-It's just something Gandalf said.
-What did he say?

608
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:52,720
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

609
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:56,620
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?

610
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,620
Frodo.

611
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:03,130
-Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
-Hello, Frodo.

612
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:04,700
Get off him.

613
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,560
Come on, Frodo.

614
00:52:06,662 --> 00:52:08,971
-What's the meaning of this?
-Samwise, hold these.

615
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:12,300
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

616
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,600
You get back here!

617
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:17,910
Get out of my field!

618
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,910
You'll know the devil
if I catch up with you!

619
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:24,090
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

620
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:25,380
And some cabbages.

621
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,520
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

622
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:32,720
-And then the mushrooms the week before.
-Yes, Pippin. My point is...

623
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:35,120
...he's clearly overreacting.

624
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:36,820
Run!

625
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,840
Oh, that was close.

626
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,050
I think I've broken something.

627
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,420
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

628
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:04,250
What? That was just a detour.
A short cut.

629
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:06,690
-Short cut to what?
-Mushrooms!

630
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,930
That's mine.

631
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:21,300
That's nice, Merry.

632
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,900
Here's a nice one, Sam.

633
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,610
I think we should get off the road.

634
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:37,190
Get off the road!

635
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:38,880
Quick!

636
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:53,070
Be quiet!

637
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,540
What was that?

638
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,730
Anything?

639
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:37,900
Nothing.

640
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:40,910
What is going on?

641
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:45,250
That Black Rider was looking
for something. Or someone.

642
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:48,080
Frodo?

643
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:49,820
Get down!

644
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:08,940
I have to leave the Shire.

645
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:12,280
Sam and I must get to Bree.

646
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:13,920
Right.

647
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:17,550
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

648
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:27,160
Run!

649
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,390
This way! Follow me!

650
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:34,990
Run!

651
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,080
Get the rope, Sam!

652
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:54,250
Frodo!

653
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,390
Run, Frodo!

654
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:57,820
Go!
-Hurry!

655
00:56:57,990 --> 00:57:00,620
Frodo, come on!

656
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:03,590
-Come on! Faster!
-Jump!

657
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:22,710
-How far to the nearest crossing?
-The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

658
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:38,820
Come on.

659
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:53,470
-What do you want?
-We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

660
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:59,820
Hobbits. Four Hobbits!

661
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:03,950
What's more, out of the Shire by your
talk. What business brings you to Bree?

662
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:07,520
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.

663
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:11,220
All right, young sir.
I meant no offense.

664
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,930
It's my job to ask questions
after nightfall.

665
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:17,010
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

666
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:19,330
Can't be too careful.

667
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:42,520
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

668
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,150
Excuse me.

669
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:11,990
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?

670
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,060
If you're looking for accommodation,

671
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:18,525
we got some nice cozy
Hobbit-sized rooms available.

672
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:23,130
Always proud to cater
to the Little Folk, Mister, uh...?

673
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,270
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

674
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:30,070
-Underhill, yes.
-We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.

675
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:33,410
-Can you tell him we've arrived?
-Gandalf?

676
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,580
Gandalf.

677
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:38,080
Oh, yes...

678
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:40,350
...I remember. Elderly chap.

679
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:43,660
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

680
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:45,860
Not seen him for six months.

681
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:53,970
What do we do now?

682
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:02,440
Sam...

683
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:04,480
...he'll be here. He'll come.

684
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:09,310
Get out of my way!

685
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:13,350
What's that?

686
01:00:13,590 --> 01:00:16,120
This, my friend, is a pint.

687
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:17,880
It comes in pints?

688
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:21,990
-I'm getting one.
-You got a whole half already!

689
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:32,170
That fellow's done nothing
but stare at you since we arrived.

690
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:37,200
Excuse me.

691
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:42,010
That Man in the corner. Who is he?

692
01:00:43,062 --> 01:00:45,177
He's one of them Rangers.

693
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:47,622
Dangerous folk, they are, wandering the Wilds.

694
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:52,708
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but around here he's known as Strider.

695
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:55,930
Strider.

696
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:12,210
<i>Baggins.</i>

697
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:17,210
<i>Baggins.</i>

698
01:01:25,771 --> 01:01:28,800
<i>Baggins.</i>

699
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:32,468
<i>-Baggins.</i>
-Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.

700
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:35,470
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

701
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:38,730
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

702
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:41,170
...and my third cousin, twice removed...

703
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,450
-Pippin!
-Steady on, Frodo.

704
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:19,450
You cannot hide.

705
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:25,510
I see you.

706
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:29,950
There is no life...

707
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:32,320
...in the void.

708
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:33,990
Only...

709
01:02:34,930 --> 01:02:36,420
...death.

710
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:47,310
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

711
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:53,988
-What do you want?
-A little more caution from you.

712
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,577
That is no trinket you carry.

713
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:58,640
-I carry nothing.
-Indeed.

714
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:01,480
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

715
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:05,350
...but to disappear entirely,
that is a rare gift.

716
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:08,490
-Who are you?
-Are you frightened?

717
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:10,720
Yes.

718
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:14,840
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

719
01:03:18,342 --> 01:03:21,862
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.

720
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:27,180
You have a stout heart, little Hobbit.
But that will not save you.

721
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:30,320
You can no longer wait
for the wizard, Frodo.

722
01:03:30,490 --> 01:03:31,540
They're coming.

723
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:56,630
What are they?

724
01:04:58,810 --> 01:05:00,940
They were once Men.

725
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:03,370
Great kings of Men.

726
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:07,010
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

727
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:10,750
Blinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

728
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:14,290
One by one, falling into darkness.

729
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:16,950
Now they are slaves to his will.

730
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:21,020
They are the Nazgûl.

731
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:23,960
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

732
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:26,170
At all times they feel...

733
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:28,300
<i>...the presence of the Ring...</i>

734
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:33,000
<i>...drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.</i>

735
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:45,950
-Where are you taking us?
-Into the Wild.

736
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:58,190
How do we know this Strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

737
01:05:58,370 --> 01:06:01,200
I think a servant of the enemy
would look fairer...

738
01:06:01,570 --> 01:06:05,510
-...and feel fouler.
-He's foul enough.

739
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:08,980
We have no choice but to trust him.

740
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:12,550
-But where is he leading us?
-To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

741
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:18,220
-To the house of Elrond.
-Did you hear that? Rivendell.

742
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:21,550
We're going to see the Elves.

743
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:47,440
-Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
-What about breakfast?

744
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:50,350
-You've already had it.
-We've had one, yes.

745
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,710
What about second breakfast?

746
01:06:56,130 --> 01:06:59,290
Don't think he knows
about second breakfast, Pip.

747
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:04,730
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

748
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:09,100
-He knows about them, doesn't he?
-I wouldn't count on it.

749
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:16,200
Pippin!

750
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:36,160
What do they eat
when they can't get Hobbit?

751
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,200
Who is she?

752
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:20,500
This woman you sing of.

753
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:26,350
'Tis the lady of Lûthien.

754
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:31,680
The Elf-maiden who gave her love
to Beren, a mortal.

755
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,650
What happened to her?

756
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:40,350
She died.

757
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,730
Get some sleep, Frodo.

758
01:08:57,010 --> 01:09:01,110
<i>The power of Isengard
is at your command...</i>

759
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:05,720
<i>...Sauron, Lord of the Earth.</i>

760
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:14,860
<i>Build me an army worthy of Mordor.</i>

761
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:24,900
What orders from Mordor, my lord?
What does the Eye command?

762
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:27,270
We have work to do.

763
01:10:09,890 --> 01:10:14,550
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.

764
01:10:14,890 --> 01:10:16,760
Rip them all down.

765
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:47,090
This was the great watchtower
of Amon SûI.

766
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:51,420
We shall rest here tonight.

767
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:06,540
These are for you.
Keep them close.

768
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:09,270
I'm going to have a look around.

769
01:11:11,610 --> 01:11:13,510
Stay here.

770
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:18,280
My tomato's burst.

771
01:11:18,450 --> 01:11:20,350
Could I have some bacon?

772
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,520
Want a tomato, Sam?

773
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:26,620
-What are you doing?!
-Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.

774
01:11:26,708 --> 01:11:29,097
-We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
-Put it out, you fools!

775
01:11:29,108 --> 01:11:32,857
-Put it out!
-That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

776
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:43,840
Go!

777
01:12:37,370 --> 01:12:38,770
Back, you devils!

778
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:03,480
Frodo!

779
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:09,450
Oh, Sam.

780
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:47,490
Strider!

781
01:14:50,230 --> 01:14:55,730
-Help him, Strider.
-He's been stabbed by a MorguI blade.

782
01:14:57,210 --> 01:15:02,110
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs Elvish medicine.

783
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:07,740
Hurry!

784
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:11,920
We're six days from Rivendell!
He'll never make it!

785
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:14,020
Hold on, Frodo.

786
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:16,580
Gandalf!

787
01:17:54,650 --> 01:17:57,680
Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.

788
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:02,720
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

789
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:07,360
Is he going to die?

790
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:12,430
He's passing into the Shadow World.
He'll soon become a Wraith like them.

791
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:21,440
-They're close.
-Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?

792
01:18:21,610 --> 01:18:23,100
-Athelas?
-Kingsfoil.

793
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,370
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.

794
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:27,740
It may help to slow the poisoning.
Hurry!

795
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:46,260
What's this?
A Ranger caught off his guard?

796
01:19:11,130 --> 01:19:12,150
Frodo.

797
01:19:13,828 --> 01:19:17,920
I am Arwen - I've come to help you.

798
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:21,177
Hear my voice...

799
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:24,130
Come back to the light.

800
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:30,840
Who is she?

801
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,280
Frodo.

802
01:19:33,550 --> 01:19:37,040
-She's an Elf.
-He's fading.

803
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:41,520
He's not going to last.

804
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,390
We must get him to my father.

805
01:19:45,130 --> 01:19:48,030
-I've been looking for you for two days.
-Where are you taking him?

806
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:54,330
There are five Wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.

807
01:19:55,110 --> 01:19:57,828
Stay with the Hobbits -
I'll send horses for you.

808
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:00,205
I'm the faster rider - I'll take him.

809
01:20:00,285 --> 01:20:02,120
The Road is too dangerous.

810
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:03,300
What are they saying?

811
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:05,760
If I can get across the river...

812
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:08,022
...the power of my people will protect him.

813
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:11,010
I do not fear them.

814
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,330
Arwen...

815
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:25,690
...ride hard. Don't look back.

816
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:35,070
What are you doing?!
Those Wraiths are still out there!

817
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:32,450
Give up the halfling, She-Elf.

818
01:22:33,430 --> 01:22:35,950
If you want him, come and claim him.

819
01:23:29,850 --> 01:23:32,340
No. No!

820
01:23:35,620 --> 01:23:37,890
Frodo, no.

821
01:23:38,090 --> 01:23:40,390
Frodo, don't give in.

822
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,590
Not now.

823
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:56,030
<i>What grace is given me...</i>

824
01:23:56,710 --> 01:23:58,540
<i>...let it pass to him.</i>

825
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:00,910
<i>Let him be spared.</i>

826
01:24:01,550 --> 01:24:03,570
<i>Save him.</i>

827
01:24:16,030 --> 01:24:21,160
-Where am I?
-You are in the house of Elrond.

828
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:28,100
And it is 10:00 in the morning
on October 24th, if you want to know.

829
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:33,810
-Gandalf!
-Yes, I'm here.

830
01:24:35,550 --> 01:24:38,580
And you're lucky to be here too.

831
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:43,250
A few more hours and you
would have been beyond our aid.

832
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:47,590
But you have some strength in you,
my dear Hobbit.

833
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:57,690
What happened, Gandalf?

834
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:04,080
-Why didn't you meet us?
-Oh, I am sorry, Frodo.

835
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:10,510
I was delayed.

836
01:25:11,390 --> 01:25:15,620
A friendship with Saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

837
01:25:19,830 --> 01:25:24,460
One ill turn deserves another.
It is over.

838
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,500
Embrace the power of the Ring...

839
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:30,630
...or embrace your own destruction!

840
01:25:32,910 --> 01:25:36,810
There is only one Lord of the Ring.

841
01:25:37,010 --> 01:25:41,000
Only one who can bend it to his will.

842
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:45,820
And he does not share power.

843
01:26:00,170 --> 01:26:03,500
So you have chosen death.

844
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:17,380
Gandalf? What is it?

845
01:26:18,350 --> 01:26:20,150
Nothing, Frodo.

846
01:26:20,790 --> 01:26:22,720
Frodo!

847
01:26:23,062 --> 01:26:24,070
Frodo!

848
01:26:24,090 --> 01:26:26,460
-Sam.
-Bless you, you're awake!

849
01:26:26,690 --> 01:26:29,420
Sam has hardly left your side.

850
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:31,790
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

851
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:37,300
By the skills of Lord Elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

852
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:42,400
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

853
01:27:30,490 --> 01:27:33,790
-Bilbo!
-Hello, Frodo, my lad.

854
01:27:33,817 --> 01:27:35,660
Bilbo.

855
01:27:36,457 --> 01:27:38,445
Oh.

856
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:42,125
<i>"There and Back Again:</i>

857
01:27:42,205 --> 01:27:45,300
<i>A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins."</i>

858
01:27:48,370 --> 01:27:51,900
-This is wonderful.
-I meant to go back...

859
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:56,040
...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

860
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,810
...visit Lake-town...

861
01:27:59,010 --> 01:28:02,410
...see the Lonely Mountain again.

862
01:28:02,850 --> 01:28:07,750
But age, it seems,
has finally caught up with me.

863
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:21,660
I miss the Shire.

864
01:28:22,070 --> 01:28:27,240
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

865
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:31,140
Off with you,
on one of your adventures.

866
01:28:34,050 --> 01:28:37,680
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

867
01:28:42,890 --> 01:28:46,090
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

868
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:49,530
My dear boy.

869
01:28:53,670 --> 01:28:57,600
-Now, what have I forgotten?
-Packed already?

870
01:28:58,410 --> 01:29:00,200
No harm in being prepared.

871
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:02,340
I thought you wanted to see the Elves, Sam.

872
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:04,560
-I do.
-More than anything.

873
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:06,050
I did.

874
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:07,260
It's just...

875
01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:11,540
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

876
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:15,420
We got the Ring this far,
to Rivendell. And I thought...

877
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:18,920
...seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

878
01:29:19,130 --> 01:29:20,820
Off home.

879
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,990
You are right, Sam.

880
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:31,930
We did what we set out to do.

881
01:29:32,510 --> 01:29:35,070
The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.

882
01:29:39,210 --> 01:29:41,510
I am ready to go home.

883
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:44,340
His strength returns.

884
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:50,250
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

885
01:29:50,830 --> 01:29:53,350
And yet to have come so far
still bearing the Ring...

886
01:29:53,530 --> 01:29:57,260
...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

887
01:29:57,470 --> 01:30:00,830
It is a burden he should never
have had to bear.

888
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:06,470
-We can ask no more of Frodo.
-Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

889
01:30:06,670 --> 01:30:11,340
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His Eye is fixed on Rivendell.

890
01:30:11,550 --> 01:30:14,310
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

891
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:17,750
Our list of allies grows thin.

892
01:30:18,490 --> 01:30:21,280
His treachery runs deeper
than you know.

893
01:30:21,490 --> 01:30:25,120
By foul craft, Saruman
has crossed Orcs with Goblin-men.

894
01:30:25,330 --> 01:30:27,790
He's breeding an army
in the caverns of Isengard.

895
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:32,660
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

896
01:30:32,870 --> 01:30:35,270
Saruman is coming for the Ring.

897
01:30:35,670 --> 01:30:39,770
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the Elves.

898
01:30:39,970 --> 01:30:44,340
We do not have the strength
to fight both Mordor and Isengard!

899
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:49,280
Gandalf...

900
01:30:50,590 --> 01:30:53,150
...the Ring cannot stay here.

901
01:31:12,670 --> 01:31:15,910
<i>This peril belongs
to all Middle-earth.</i>

902
01:31:16,110 --> 01:31:18,840
<i>They must decide now how to end it.</i>

903
01:31:19,910 --> 01:31:23,440
The time of the Elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

904
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:27,710
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The Dwarves?

905
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:33,020
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

906
01:31:34,630 --> 01:31:37,460
It is in Men
that we must place our hope.

907
01:31:37,830 --> 01:31:39,530
Men?

908
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:43,630
Men are weak.
The race of Men is failing.

909
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:48,240
The blood of Nûmenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

910
01:31:48,610 --> 01:31:52,070
It is because of Men
the Ring survives.

911
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:53,910
I was there, Gandalf.

912
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:57,420
<i>I was there 3000 years ago...</i>

913
01:32:04,230 --> 01:32:06,660
<i>... when Isildûr took the Ring.</i>

914
01:32:06,860 --> 01:32:10,730
I was there the day
the strength of Men failed.

915
01:32:13,270 --> 01:32:15,860
Isildûr, hurry! Follow me.

916
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:21,070
<i>I led Isildûr into the heart
of Mount Doom...</i>

917
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:24,840
<i>... where the Ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.</i>

918
01:32:25,010 --> 01:32:27,610
Cast it into the fire!

919
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:36,590
-Destroy it!
-No.

920
01:32:37,930 --> 01:32:40,090
Isildûr!

921
01:32:40,530 --> 01:32:45,260
<i>It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.</i>

922
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:53,640
Isildûr kept the Ring.
The line of kings is broken.

923
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:58,210
There's no strength left
in the world of Men.

924
01:32:58,410 --> 01:33:03,210
-They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
-There is one who could unite them.

925
01:33:03,450 --> 01:33:06,780
One who could reclaim
the throne of Gondor.

926
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:12,290
He turned from that path
a long time ago.

927
01:33:12,490 --> 01:33:14,620
He has chosen exile.

928
01:33:45,660 --> 01:33:47,690
You are no Elf.

929
01:33:47,860 --> 01:33:49,960
Men of the South are welcome here.

930
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:54,090
-Who are you?
-I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.

931
01:33:55,570 --> 01:33:58,370
Then we are here on common purpose...

932
01:33:58,770 --> 01:34:00,210
...friend.

933
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:18,360
The shards of Narsil.

934
01:34:21,860 --> 01:34:26,300
The blade that cut the Ring
from Sauron's hand.

935
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:31,430
It's still sharp.

936
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:43,410
But no more than a broken heirloom.

937
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:13,270
Why do you fear the past?

938
01:35:14,150 --> 01:35:19,550
You are Isildûr's heir,
not Isildûr himself.

939
01:35:19,750 --> 01:35:23,160
You are not bound to his fate.

940
01:35:23,690 --> 01:35:27,650
The same blood flows in my veins.

941
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:33,260
The same weakness.

942
01:35:35,970 --> 01:35:38,770
Your time will come.

943
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:43,340
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

944
01:35:46,180 --> 01:35:49,510
The Shadow does not hold sway yet.

945
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:53,010
Not over you... not over me.

946
01:36:04,660 --> 01:36:07,460
Do you remember when we first met?

947
01:36:11,330 --> 01:36:15,320
I thought I had strayed into a dream.

948
01:36:16,210 --> 01:36:18,460
Long years have passed.

949
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:22,920
You did not have the cares you carry now.

950
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:27,900
Do you remember what I told you?

951
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:36,560
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

952
01:36:38,630 --> 01:36:43,570
...forsaking the immortal life
of your people.

953
01:36:44,670 --> 01:36:46,660
And to that I hold.

954
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:50,440
I would rather share
one lifetime with you...

955
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:54,510
...than face all the Ages
of this world alone.

956
01:37:03,290 --> 01:37:06,750
I choose a mortal life.

957
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:12,360
-You cannot give me this.
-It is mine to give to whom I will...

958
01:37:15,570 --> 01:37:18,090
...like my heart.

959
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:37,580
Strangers from distant lands,
friends of old...

960
01:37:37,790 --> 01:37:41,750
...you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.

961
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:47,270
Middle-earth stands upon the brink
of destruction. None can escape it.

962
01:37:47,470 --> 01:37:51,000
You will unite, or you will fall.

963
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:55,470
Each race is bound to this fate,
this one doom.

964
01:37:57,350 --> 01:38:00,840
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.

965
01:38:14,930 --> 01:38:16,620
So it is true.

966
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:36,170
In a dream...

967
01:38:37,820 --> 01:38:41,020
...I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

968
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:43,020
...but in the West
a pale light lingered.

969
01:38:43,820 --> 01:38:45,620
A voice was crying:

970
01:38:45,860 --> 01:38:48,800
"Your doom is near at hand.

971
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:52,530
Isildûr's Bane is found."

972
01:38:56,570 --> 01:38:58,370
Isildûr's Bane.

973
01:38:58,970 --> 01:39:00,270
Boromir!

974
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:27,230
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in Imladris.

975
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:31,170
I do not ask your pardon,
Master Elrond...

976
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:33,430
...for the Black Speech of Mordor...

977
01:39:33,710 --> 01:39:35,110
...may yet be heard...

978
01:39:35,310 --> 01:39:38,240
...in every corner of the West!

979
01:39:38,410 --> 01:39:41,110
The Ring is altogether evil.

980
01:39:41,420 --> 01:39:42,940
It is a gift.

981
01:39:43,550 --> 01:39:45,610
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

982
01:39:46,220 --> 01:39:48,350
Why not use this Ring?

983
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:51,320
Long has my father,
the Steward of Gondor...

984
01:39:51,530 --> 01:39:55,860
...kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

985
01:39:56,100 --> 01:39:58,360
...are your lands kept safe.

986
01:40:00,100 --> 01:40:04,470
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

987
01:40:04,710 --> 01:40:08,440
You cannot wield it.
None of us can.

988
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:13,100
The One Ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

989
01:40:13,350 --> 01:40:16,870
And what would a Ranger know
of this matter?

990
01:40:17,150 --> 01:40:19,140
This is no mere Ranger.

991
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:23,780
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

992
01:40:24,290 --> 01:40:27,230
You owe him your allegiance.

993
01:40:31,300 --> 01:40:33,230
Aragorn.

994
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,800
This is Isildûr's heir?

995
01:40:40,140 --> 01:40:42,910
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

996
01:40:44,420 --> 01:40:46,810
Sit down, Legolas.

997
01:40:49,780 --> 01:40:52,620
Gondor has no king.

998
01:40:54,490 --> 01:40:56,180
Gondor needs no king.

999
01:41:02,900 --> 01:41:06,530
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

1000
01:41:07,540 --> 01:41:11,030
You have only one choice.

1001
01:41:11,270 --> 01:41:13,600
The Ring must be destroyed.

1002
01:41:18,850 --> 01:41:21,440
What are we waiting for?

1003
01:41:33,530 --> 01:41:36,550
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli,
son of Glóin...

1004
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:41,000
...by any craft that we here possess.

1005
01:41:41,540 --> 01:41:45,670
The Ring was made in the fires
of Mount Doom.

1006
01:41:45,870 --> 01:41:49,710
Only there can it be unmade.

1007
01:41:50,810 --> 01:41:53,370
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

1008
01:41:53,580 --> 01:41:58,540
...and cast back into the fiery chasm
from whence it came.

1009
01:42:00,550 --> 01:42:02,550
One of you...

1010
01:42:03,060 --> 01:42:05,220
...must do this.

1011
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:11,860
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

1012
01:42:12,770 --> 01:42:16,400
Its Black Gates are guarded
by more than just Orcs.

1013
01:42:17,190 --> 01:42:20,560
There is evil there
that does not sleep.

1014
01:42:21,140 --> 01:42:25,220
And the Great Eye is ever-watchful.

1015
01:42:26,580 --> 01:42:28,610
It is a barren wasteland...

1016
01:42:28,850 --> 01:42:32,410
...riddled with fire, and ash
and dust.

1017
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:36,490
The very air you breathe
is a poisonous fume.

1018
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:40,990
Not with 10,000 men
could you do this. It is folly.

1019
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:45,690
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond
has said? The Ring must be destroyed.

1020
01:42:45,870 --> 01:42:48,430
And I suppose you think
you are the one to do it!

1021
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:53,300
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

1022
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:58,770
I will be dead before I see the Ring
in the hands of an Elf!

1023
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:03,270
Never trust an Elf!

1024
01:43:04,450 --> 01:43:10,290
Do you not understand? While you bicker
amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows!

1025
01:43:10,620 --> 01:43:13,530
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

1026
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:34,540
I will take it.

1027
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:39,040
I will take it.

1028
01:43:44,830 --> 01:43:47,920
I will take the Ring to Mordor.

1029
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,270
Though...

1030
01:44:00,370 --> 01:44:02,170
...I do not know the way.

1031
01:44:04,210 --> 01:44:08,510
I will help you bear
this burden, Frodo Baggins...

1032
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:12,120
...as long as it is yours to bear.

1033
01:44:13,220 --> 01:44:16,280
If by my life
or death I can protect you...

1034
01:44:17,020 --> 01:44:18,360
...I will.

1035
01:44:21,630 --> 01:44:23,890
You have my sword.

1036
01:44:25,700 --> 01:44:27,790
And you have my bow.

1037
01:44:28,370 --> 01:44:30,860
And my ax.

1038
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:40,870
You carry the fates
of us all, little one.

1039
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:46,550
If this is indeed
the will of the Council...

1040
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:48,651
...then Gondor will see it done.

1041
01:44:48,685 --> 01:44:49,930
Hey!

1042
01:44:52,060 --> 01:44:54,280
Mr. Frodo's not going anywhere without me.

1043
01:44:54,300 --> 01:44:56,690
No indeed, it is hardly possible to separate you...

1044
01:44:56,710 --> 01:45:01,260
...even when he is summoned
to a secret Council and you are not.

1045
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:04,400
Wait! We're coming too!

1046
01:45:06,410 --> 01:45:09,210
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

1047
01:45:09,410 --> 01:45:12,780
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

1048
01:45:13,150 --> 01:45:14,410
...mission.

1049
01:45:14,650 --> 01:45:16,080
Quest.

1050
01:45:16,550 --> 01:45:17,570
Thing.

1051
01:45:19,450 --> 01:45:22,180
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

1052
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:25,660
Nine companions.

1053
01:45:27,430 --> 01:45:29,260
So be it.

1054
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:32,660
You shall be
the Fellowship of the Ring.

1055
01:45:33,270 --> 01:45:35,100
Great!

1056
01:45:35,370 --> 01:45:37,600
Where are we going?

1057
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:15,810
She wanted to protect her child...

1058
01:46:17,090 --> 01:46:20,310
she thought in Rivendell you would be safe.

1059
01:46:23,570 --> 01:46:27,060
In her heart, your mother knew
you'd be hunted all your life.

1060
01:46:27,540 --> 01:46:29,270
That you'd never escape your fate.

1061
01:46:29,810 --> 01:46:33,410
The skill of the Elves
can reforge the sword of kings...

1062
01:46:33,850 --> 01:46:37,780
...but only you have the power
to wield it.

1063
01:46:38,820 --> 01:46:41,250
I do not want that power.

1064
01:46:41,420 --> 01:46:44,150
I have never wanted it.

1065
01:46:45,430 --> 01:46:48,020
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

1066
01:46:52,570 --> 01:46:54,900
My old sword! Sting.

1067
01:46:55,100 --> 01:46:56,300
Here, take it. Take it.

1068
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:05,900
-It's so light.
-Yes, yes. Made by the Elves, you know.

1069
01:47:06,380 --> 01:47:10,540
The blade glows blue
when Orcs are close.

1070
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:15,350
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

1071
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:18,020
Here's a pretty thing.

1072
01:47:18,430 --> 01:47:19,720
Mithril.

1073
01:47:20,530 --> 01:47:24,900
As light as a feather,
and as hard as dragon scales.

1074
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:28,360
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

1075
01:47:31,480 --> 01:47:32,480
Oh.

1076
01:47:36,410 --> 01:47:38,440
My old ring.

1077
01:47:39,710 --> 01:47:43,620
I should very much like...

1078
01:47:43,850 --> 01:47:47,880
...to hold it again, one last time.

1079
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:08,900
I'm sorry I brought this upon you,
my boy.

1080
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:13,300
I'm sorry that you
must carry this burden.

1081
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:20,910
I'm sorry for everything.

1082
01:48:35,700 --> 01:48:40,110
The Ring-bearer is setting out
on the Quest of Mount Doom.

1083
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:44,040
On you who travel with him,
no oath...

1084
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:47,410
...nor bond is laid to go further
than you will.

1085
01:48:50,820 --> 01:48:53,340
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

1086
01:48:53,820 --> 01:48:57,720
May the blessings of Elves and Men...

1087
01:48:58,290 --> 01:49:00,920
...and all Free Folk go with you.

1088
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:08,060
The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer.

1089
01:49:26,490 --> 01:49:28,980
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

1090
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:31,350
Left.

1091
01:50:50,970 --> 01:50:55,410
<i>We must hold to this course, west
of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.</i>

1092
01:50:55,610 --> 01:50:59,340
<i>If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.</i>

1093
01:50:59,580 --> 01:51:03,140
<i>From there, our road
turns east to Mordor.</i>

1094
01:51:03,320 --> 01:51:07,150
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

1095
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:09,980
Move your feet.

1096
01:51:10,190 --> 01:51:11,560
-You look good, Pippin.
-Thanks.

1097
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:13,160
Faster!

1098
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:18,330
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

1099
01:51:18,500 --> 01:51:21,260
...I'd say we were taking
the long way 'round.

1100
01:51:21,770 --> 01:51:24,830
Gandalf, we could pass through
the Mines of Moria.

1101
01:51:25,470 --> 01:51:29,340
My cousin Balin would give us
a royal welcome.

1102
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:30,400
No, Gimli.

1103
01:51:30,420 --> 01:51:35,140
I would not take the road through Moria
unless I had no other choice.

1104
01:51:44,160 --> 01:51:45,320
Sorry!

1105
01:51:46,030 --> 01:51:47,520
Get him!

1106
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,460
-For the Shire!
-Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

1107
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,370
Gentlemen, that's enough.

1108
01:51:58,140 --> 01:51:59,730
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

1109
01:52:00,210 --> 01:52:02,840
-What is that?
-Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

1110
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:05,740
It's moving fast.

1111
01:52:06,010 --> 01:52:08,170
Against the wind.

1112
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:11,040
-Crebain from Dunland!
-Hide!

1113
01:52:11,250 --> 01:52:14,020
-Hurry!
-Take cover!

1114
01:52:47,420 --> 01:52:49,150
Spies of Saruman.

1115
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:53,190
The passage south is being watched.

1116
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:57,660
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.

1117
01:53:10,280 --> 01:53:11,970
Frodo!

1118
01:53:30,970 --> 01:53:33,260
Boromir.

1119
01:53:33,470 --> 01:53:37,700
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

1120
01:53:37,910 --> 01:53:41,000
...over so small a thing.

1121
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:46,210
Such a little thing.

1122
01:53:46,410 --> 01:53:47,850
Boromir!

1123
01:53:48,480 --> 01:53:51,140
Give the Ring to Frodo.

1124
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,020
As you wish.

1125
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:05,790
I care not.

1126
01:54:41,170 --> 01:54:45,870
So, Gandalf, you try
to lead them over Caradhras.

1127
01:54:46,070 --> 01:54:50,670
And if that fails,
where then will you go?

1128
01:54:51,980 --> 01:54:54,910
<i>If the mountain defeats you...</i>

1129
01:54:55,150 --> 01:54:59,590
<i>...will you risk
a more dangerous road?</i>

1130
01:55:11,930 --> 01:55:14,870
There is a fell voice on the air.

1131
01:55:15,940 --> 01:55:17,430
It's Saruman!

1132
01:55:26,380 --> 01:55:31,040
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

1133
01:55:31,250 --> 01:55:33,080
No!

1134
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:41,390
We must get off the mountain!

1135
01:56:41,820 --> 01:56:46,190
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

1136
01:56:46,390 --> 01:56:49,760
The Gap of Rohan takes us
too close to Isengard!

1137
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:53,660
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

1138
01:56:53,900 --> 01:56:56,700
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.

1139
01:56:58,540 --> 01:57:02,410
<i>Moria. You fear to go
into those mines.</i>

1140
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:08,110
The Dwarves delved too greedily
and too deep.

1141
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:13,790
<i>You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-dûm:</i>

1142
01:57:15,060 --> 01:57:18,550
Shadow and flame.

1143
01:57:21,930 --> 01:57:24,660
Let the Ring-bearer decide.

1144
01:57:29,340 --> 01:57:31,500
We cannot stay here!

1145
01:57:31,670 --> 01:57:34,470
This will be the death of the Hobbits.

1146
01:57:34,640 --> 01:57:36,300
Frodo?

1147
01:57:39,350 --> 01:57:42,210
We will go through the mines.

1148
01:57:43,020 --> 01:57:44,950
So be it.

1149
01:57:51,530 --> 01:57:55,390
Frodo, come and help an old man.

1150
01:57:58,970 --> 01:58:01,200
How is your shoulder?

1151
01:58:01,370 --> 01:58:04,600
-Better than it was.
-And the Ring?

1152
01:58:06,210 --> 01:58:08,700
You feel its power growing, don't you?

1153
01:58:09,180 --> 01:58:12,080
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

1154
01:58:12,550 --> 01:58:16,410
Evil will be drawn to you
from outside the Fellowship.

1155
01:58:16,580 --> 01:58:19,180
And, I fear, from within.

1156
01:58:21,790 --> 01:58:25,950
-Who then do I trust?
-You must trust yourself.

1157
01:58:26,130 --> 01:58:29,030
Trust your own strengths.

1158
01:58:29,200 --> 01:58:31,760
-What do you mean?
-There are many powers in this world...

1159
01:58:31,930 --> 01:58:34,030
...for good or for evil.

1160
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:36,500
Some are greater than I am.

1161
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:40,630
And against some I have not yet
been tested.

1162
01:58:42,080 --> 01:58:43,410
The walls...

1163
01:58:44,110 --> 01:58:46,200
...of Moria.

1164
01:58:51,920 --> 01:58:54,910
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

1165
01:58:55,120 --> 01:58:59,580
Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

1166
01:58:59,930 --> 01:59:02,390
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1167
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:13,740
Well, let's see.

1168
01:59:13,970 --> 01:59:15,340
Ithildin.

1169
01:59:15,980 --> 01:59:19,340
It mirrors only starlight
and moonlight.

1170
01:59:33,430 --> 01:59:37,490
It reads, "The Doors of Durin,
Lord of Moria.

1171
01:59:38,100 --> 01:59:42,690
-Speak, friend, and enter."
-What do you suppose that means?

1172
01:59:42,770 --> 01:59:43,800
Oh, it's quite simple.

1173
01:59:43,820 --> 01:59:46,860
If you are a friend, you speak
the password and the doors will open.

1174
02:00:11,470 --> 02:00:12,590
Nothing's happening.

1175
02:00:19,610 --> 02:00:23,840
I once knew every spell
in all the tongues of Elves...

1176
02:00:24,110 --> 02:00:26,880
...Men and Orcs.

1177
02:00:27,180 --> 02:00:28,370
What are you going to do, then?

1178
02:00:28,650 --> 02:00:30,840
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took!

1179
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:33,050
And if that does not shatter them...

1180
02:00:33,250 --> 02:00:35,980
...and I am allowed a little peace
from foolish questions...

1181
02:00:36,160 --> 02:00:39,610
...I will try to find the opening words.

1182
02:00:52,440 --> 02:00:55,000
Mines are no place for a pony.

1183
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:59,370
-Even one so brave as Bill.
-Bye-bye, Bill.

1184
02:01:00,550 --> 02:01:03,350
Go on, Bill. Go on.

1185
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:07,410
Don't worry, Sam,
he knows the way home.

1186
02:01:14,230 --> 02:01:16,790
Do not disturb the water.

1187
02:01:17,030 --> 02:01:18,900
Oh, it's useless.

1188
02:01:31,580 --> 02:01:33,740
It's a riddle.

1189
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:39,610
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

1190
02:01:39,990 --> 02:01:42,920
What's the Elvish word for "friend"?

1191
02:01:44,320 --> 02:01:45,620
Mellon.

1192
02:02:03,710 --> 02:02:08,580
Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.

1193
02:02:09,020 --> 02:02:14,750
Roaring fires, malt beer,
ripe meat off the bone!

1194
02:02:16,260 --> 02:02:19,320
This, my friend,
is the home of my cousin Balin.

1195
02:02:19,660 --> 02:02:22,090
And they call it a mine.

1196
02:02:22,300 --> 02:02:24,260
A mine!

1197
02:02:25,300 --> 02:02:28,630
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

1198
02:02:34,770 --> 02:02:36,330
No...

1199
02:02:37,610 --> 02:02:39,270
No!

1200
02:02:41,880 --> 02:02:43,440
Goblins.

1201
02:02:47,350 --> 02:02:51,650
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

1202
02:02:52,690 --> 02:02:55,290
Now, get out of here. Get out!

1203
02:02:58,060 --> 02:03:00,460
-Frodo!
-Help!

1204
02:03:00,670 --> 02:03:02,290
Strider!

1205
02:03:02,470 --> 02:03:05,230
-Help!
-Get off him!

1206
02:03:05,410 --> 02:03:06,460
Aragorn!

1207
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:17,910
Frodo!

1208
02:03:44,240 --> 02:03:45,340
Into the mines!

1209
02:03:45,510 --> 02:03:48,710
-Legolas!
-Into the cave!

1210
02:03:53,020 --> 02:03:54,750
Run!

1211
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:15,230
We now have but one choice.

1212
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:20,350
We must face the long dark of Moria.

1213
02:04:20,580 --> 02:04:22,550
Be on your guard.

1214
02:04:22,750 --> 02:04:26,210
There are older
and fouler things than Orcs...

1215
02:04:26,390 --> 02:04:29,910
...in the deep places of the world.

1216
02:04:37,900 --> 02:04:41,800
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey
to the other side.

1217
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:45,870
Let us hope that our presence
may go unnoticed.

1218
02:05:31,650 --> 02:05:35,350
The wealth of Moria was not in gold...

1219
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:37,960
...or jewels...

1220
02:05:38,120 --> 02:05:41,150
...but mithril.

1221
02:05:59,510 --> 02:06:04,380
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

1222
02:06:04,650 --> 02:06:08,590
-Oh, that was a kingly gift.
-Yes.

1223
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:10,690
I never told him...

1224
02:06:10,860 --> 02:06:15,820
...but its worth was greater than
the value of the Shire.

1225
02:06:28,170 --> 02:06:29,870
Pippin.

1226
02:06:50,230 --> 02:06:53,200
I have no memory of this place.

1227
02:06:55,240 --> 02:06:56,700
-Are we lost?
-No.

1228
02:06:56,870 --> 02:06:59,400
-I think we are.
-Gandalf's thinking.

1229
02:06:59,610 --> 02:07:01,070
-Merry?
-What?

1230
02:07:01,270 --> 02:07:03,210
I'm hungry.

1231
02:07:14,590 --> 02:07:19,020
-There's something down there.
-It's Gollum.

1232
02:07:19,230 --> 02:07:23,320
-Gollum?
-He's been following us for three days.

1233
02:07:23,560 --> 02:07:27,730
-He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?
-Escaped...

1234
02:07:28,430 --> 02:07:30,060
...or was set loose.

1235
02:07:30,600 --> 02:07:34,230
Now the Ring has brought him here.

1236
02:07:36,840 --> 02:07:39,640
He will never be rid of his need for it.

1237
02:07:39,810 --> 02:07:45,510
He hates and loves the Ring,
as he hates and loves himself.

1238
02:07:45,690 --> 02:07:50,590
Sméagol's life is a sad story.

1239
02:07:50,760 --> 02:07:56,700
Yes, Sméagol he was once called.
Before the Ring found him.

1240
02:07:57,660 --> 02:08:00,460
Before it drove him mad.

1241
02:08:00,700 --> 02:08:03,600
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

1242
02:08:03,800 --> 02:08:05,000
Pity?

1243
02:08:06,070 --> 02:08:09,010
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

1244
02:08:09,880 --> 02:08:15,110
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

1245
02:08:16,580 --> 02:08:19,020
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1246
02:08:21,450 --> 02:08:25,390
Do not be too eager
to deal out death and judgment.

1247
02:08:25,630 --> 02:08:28,530
Even the very wise
cannot see all ends.

1248
02:08:29,130 --> 02:08:35,030
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

1249
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:38,700
...before this is over.

1250
02:08:40,210 --> 02:08:44,040
The pity of Bilbo
may rule the fate of many.

1251
02:08:50,720 --> 02:08:54,050
I wish the Ring
had never come to me.

1252
02:08:55,490 --> 02:08:57,550
I wish none of this had happened.

1253
02:08:57,720 --> 02:09:02,750
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

1254
02:09:03,560 --> 02:09:09,060
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

1255
02:09:10,570 --> 02:09:14,560
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

1256
02:09:14,940 --> 02:09:17,410
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.

1257
02:09:17,910 --> 02:09:22,250
In which case,
you also were meant to have it.

1258
02:09:22,480 --> 02:09:25,580
And that is an encouraging thought.

1259
02:09:28,350 --> 02:09:30,340
Uh!

1260
02:09:30,460 --> 02:09:32,420
It's that way.

1261
02:09:32,690 --> 02:09:34,990
-He's remembered.
-No.

1262
02:09:35,190 --> 02:09:38,990
But the air doesn't smell
so foul down here.

1263
02:09:39,200 --> 02:09:44,400
If in doubt, Meriadoc,
always follow your nose.

1264
02:09:59,220 --> 02:10:03,380
Let me risk a little more light.

1265
02:10:08,030 --> 02:10:10,090
Behold...

1266
02:10:10,530 --> 02:10:15,800
...the great realm
and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

1267
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:21,670
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.

1268
02:10:46,600 --> 02:10:48,330
Gimli!

1269
02:10:55,740 --> 02:10:57,370
No!

1270
02:10:59,950 --> 02:11:03,110
Oh, no.

1271
02:11:04,950 --> 02:11:06,210
No.

1272
02:11:13,490 --> 02:11:15,480
"Here lies Balin...

1273
02:11:15,960 --> 02:11:17,950
...son of Fundin...

1274
02:11:18,260 --> 02:11:20,890
...Lord of Moria."

1275
02:11:21,970 --> 02:11:23,630
He is dead, then.

1276
02:11:25,370 --> 02:11:27,070
It's as I feared.

1277
02:11:45,290 --> 02:11:48,190
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1278
02:11:48,430 --> 02:11:53,130
"They have taken the bridge
and the second hall.

1279
02:11:54,200 --> 02:11:56,790
We have barred the gates...

1280
02:11:57,470 --> 02:11:59,960
...but cannot hold them for long.

1281
02:12:00,140 --> 02:12:02,970
The ground shakes.

1282
02:12:03,410 --> 02:12:04,970
Drums...

1283
02:12:05,340 --> 02:12:08,710
...drums in the deep.

1284
02:12:12,290 --> 02:12:14,310
We cannot get out.

1285
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:20,160
A Shadow moves in the dark.

1286
02:12:21,830 --> 02:12:24,420
We cannot get out.

1287
02:12:27,430 --> 02:12:29,330
They are coming."

1288
02:13:12,380 --> 02:13:14,210
Fool of a Took!

1289
02:13:14,580 --> 02:13:18,380
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

1290
02:13:44,410 --> 02:13:46,110
Frodo!

1291
02:13:48,410 --> 02:13:49,880
Orcs.

1292
02:13:56,890 --> 02:13:58,880
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1293
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:07,830
They have a cave-troll.

1294
02:14:23,650 --> 02:14:24,810
Let them come!

1295
02:14:25,320 --> 02:14:28,850
There is one Dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

1296
02:16:47,730 --> 02:16:50,490
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1297
02:16:55,200 --> 02:16:56,960
Frodo!

1298
02:17:30,500 --> 02:17:32,370
Aragorn! Aragorn!

1299
02:17:33,370 --> 02:17:35,240
Frodo!

1300
02:18:20,420 --> 02:18:22,280
Frodo!

1301
02:19:22,520 --> 02:19:23,810
Oh, no.

1302
02:19:32,190 --> 02:19:34,130
He's alive.

1303
02:19:36,560 --> 02:19:39,530
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1304
02:19:39,770 --> 02:19:41,960
You should be dead.

1305
02:19:42,170 --> 02:19:44,660
That spear would have skewered
a wild boar.

1306
02:19:44,870 --> 02:19:49,640
I think there's more to this Hobbit
than meets the eye.

1307
02:19:55,510 --> 02:19:56,540
Mithril.

1308
02:19:59,350 --> 02:20:01,980
You are full of surprises,
Master Baggins.

1309
02:20:07,990 --> 02:20:09,890
To the Bridge of Khazad-dûm!

1310
02:20:24,940 --> 02:20:26,610
This way!

1311
02:21:36,980 --> 02:21:39,970
What is this new devilry?

1312
02:21:56,040 --> 02:21:58,830
A Balrog.

1313
02:21:59,170 --> 02:22:02,300
A demon of the ancient world.

1314
02:22:04,510 --> 02:22:06,940
This foe is beyond any of you.

1315
02:22:08,110 --> 02:22:09,670
Run!

1316
02:22:17,020 --> 02:22:18,510
Quickly!

1317
02:22:35,140 --> 02:22:36,440
Gandalf.

1318
02:22:37,040 --> 02:22:38,630
Lead them on, Aragorn.

1319
02:22:40,050 --> 02:22:42,540
The bridge is near.

1320
02:22:44,580 --> 02:22:48,710
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

1321
02:23:17,850 --> 02:23:19,580
Gandalf!

1322
02:23:37,870 --> 02:23:39,100
Merry! Pippin!

1323
02:23:50,220 --> 02:23:51,740
Sam!

1324
02:23:54,450 --> 02:23:57,720
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

1325
02:24:00,760 --> 02:24:02,160
Not the beard!

1326
02:24:15,410 --> 02:24:17,310
Steady.

1327
02:24:19,410 --> 02:24:21,070
Hold on!

1328
02:24:42,130 --> 02:24:43,330
Hang on!

1329
02:24:54,110 --> 02:24:55,840
Lean forward!

1330
02:24:58,820 --> 02:24:59,840
Steady.

1331
02:25:01,150 --> 02:25:02,310
Come on!

1332
02:25:02,550 --> 02:25:04,040
Now!

1333
02:25:21,210 --> 02:25:23,070
Over the bridge!

1334
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:24,830
Fly!

1335
02:26:09,420 --> 02:26:11,510
You cannot pass!

1336
02:26:11,690 --> 02:26:13,250
Gandalf!

1337
02:26:17,530 --> 02:26:22,400
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

1338
02:26:23,400 --> 02:26:27,200
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udûn!

1339
02:26:37,180 --> 02:26:39,150
Go back to the Shadow.

1340
02:26:46,960 --> 02:26:51,420
You shall not pass!

1341
02:27:18,590 --> 02:27:22,460
-No! No!
-Gandalf!

1342
02:27:30,140 --> 02:27:32,600
Fly, you fools!

1343
02:27:36,740 --> 02:27:38,900
No!

1344
02:27:45,020 --> 02:27:47,210
Aragorn!

1345
02:28:44,510 --> 02:28:47,310
Legolas, get them up.

1346
02:28:51,380 --> 02:28:53,280
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

1347
02:28:53,490 --> 02:28:57,080
By nightfall, these hills will
be swarming with Orcs.

1348
02:28:57,320 --> 02:29:00,660
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.

1349
02:29:01,560 --> 02:29:04,860
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

1350
02:29:06,360 --> 02:29:08,560
On your feet, Sam.

1351
02:29:08,900 --> 02:29:10,390
Frodo?

1352
02:29:12,440 --> 02:29:14,170
Frodo!

1353
02:30:06,660 --> 02:30:09,220
Stay close, young Hobbits!

1354
02:30:09,960 --> 02:30:14,090
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.

1355
02:30:14,300 --> 02:30:16,860
An Elf-witch...

1356
02:30:17,400 --> 02:30:20,270
...of terrible power.

1357
02:30:20,810 --> 02:30:23,000
All who look upon her...

1358
02:30:23,240 --> 02:30:25,000
...fall under her spell.

1359
02:30:25,240 --> 02:30:26,510
<i>Frodo!</i>

1360
02:30:28,780 --> 02:30:30,810
And are never seen again.

1361
02:30:31,020 --> 02:30:35,510
<i>Your coming to us is
as the footsteps of doom.</i>

1362
02:30:35,750 --> 02:30:39,450
<i>You bring great evil here,
Ring-bearer.</i>

1363
02:30:39,660 --> 02:30:41,420
Mr. Frodo?

1364
02:30:46,700 --> 02:30:52,300
Well, here's one Dwarf
she won't ensnare so easily.

1365
02:30:52,500 --> 02:30:57,030
I have the eyes of a hawk
and the ears of a fox.

1366
02:31:04,720 --> 02:31:09,310
The Dwarf breathes so loud,
we could have shot him in the dark.

1367
02:31:13,390 --> 02:31:16,920
Welcome Legolas, son of Thranduil.

1368
02:31:17,020 --> 02:31:20,280
Our Fellowship stands in your debt.

1369
02:31:22,240 --> 02:31:24,720
Aragorn of the Dunedain...

1370
02:31:24,740 --> 02:31:26,680
you are known to us.

1371
02:31:27,470 --> 02:31:29,740
So much for the legendary courtesy
of the Elves!

1372
02:31:29,940 --> 02:31:31,840
Speak words we can all understand!

1373
02:31:32,010 --> 02:31:36,570
We have not had dealings
with the Dwarves since the Dark Days.

1374
02:31:36,850 --> 02:31:39,370
And you know what this Dwarf
says to that?

1375
02:31:46,220 --> 02:31:48,190
That was not so courteous.

1376
02:31:54,730 --> 02:31:58,760
You bring great evil with you.

1377
02:32:00,540 --> 02:32:02,730
You can go no further.

1378
02:32:40,150 --> 02:32:42,770
Gandalf's death was not in vain.

1379
02:32:43,920 --> 02:32:45,820
Nor would he have you give up hope.

1380
02:32:47,320 --> 02:32:50,650
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

1381
02:32:51,520 --> 02:32:54,620
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

1382
02:32:57,460 --> 02:32:59,520
You will follow me.

1383
02:33:11,240 --> 02:33:13,180
Caras Galadhon.

1384
02:33:13,810 --> 02:33:16,780
The heart of Elvendom on earth.

1385
02:33:16,950 --> 02:33:22,610
Realm of the Lord Celeborn
and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.

1386
02:34:41,730 --> 02:34:44,830
The enemy knows you have entered here.

1387
02:34:45,500 --> 02:34:50,670
What hope you had in secrecy
is now gone.

1388
02:34:52,410 --> 02:34:56,850
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from Rivendell.

1389
02:34:57,080 --> 02:34:58,910
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

1390
02:34:59,080 --> 02:35:02,210
For I much desire to speak with him.

1391
02:35:02,390 --> 02:35:05,190
I can no longer see him from afar.

1392
02:35:06,060 --> 02:35:11,220
Gandalf the Grey did not pass
the borders of this land.

1393
02:35:11,460 --> 02:35:13,930
He has fallen into Shadow.

1394
02:35:18,600 --> 02:35:23,100
He was taken by both Shadow and flame.

1395
02:35:24,780 --> 02:35:28,470
A Balrog of Morgoth.

1396
02:35:29,210 --> 02:35:32,580
For we went needlessly
into the net of Moria.

1397
02:35:34,720 --> 02:35:37,950
Needless were none of the deeds
of Gandalf in life.

1398
02:35:38,590 --> 02:35:41,890
We do not yet know his full purpose.

1399
02:35:46,630 --> 02:35:50,970
Do not let the great emptiness
of Khazad-dûm fill your heart...

1400
02:35:51,140 --> 02:35:53,470
...Gimli, son of Glóin.

1401
02:35:54,470 --> 02:35:58,000
For the world has grown
full of peril...

1402
02:35:59,480 --> 02:36:02,140
...and in all lands love...

1403
02:36:02,310 --> 02:36:05,810
...is now mingled with grief.

1404
02:36:18,460 --> 02:36:21,160
What now becomes of this Fellowship?

1405
02:36:21,730 --> 02:36:24,730
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

1406
02:36:27,670 --> 02:36:30,970
The quest stands upon the edge
of a knife.

1407
02:36:31,140 --> 02:36:34,240
Stray but a little and it will fail...

1408
02:36:34,980 --> 02:36:37,810
...to the ruin of all.

1409
02:36:42,150 --> 02:36:47,990
Yet hope remains
while the Company is true.

1410
02:36:49,530 --> 02:36:54,290
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...

1411
02:36:54,700 --> 02:36:58,360
...for you are weary with sorrow
and much toil.

1412
02:37:00,640 --> 02:37:02,770
Tonight, you will sleep...

1413
02:37:03,040 --> 02:37:06,480
<i>Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...</i>

1414
02:37:07,910 --> 02:37:09,710
<i>...one who has seen the Eye!</i>

1415
02:37:24,360 --> 02:37:26,920
A lament for Gandalf.

1416
02:37:34,210 --> 02:37:35,730
What do they say about him?

1417
02:37:36,070 --> 02:37:38,670
I have not the heart to tell you.

1418
02:37:41,580 --> 02:37:43,810
For me, the grief is still too near.

1419
02:37:46,780 --> 02:37:49,620
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.

1420
02:37:49,790 --> 02:37:52,810
There should be a verse about them.

1421
02:37:56,290 --> 02:37:58,290
<i>The finest rockets ever seen</i>

1422
02:37:59,400 --> 02:38:02,230
<i>They burst in stars of blue and green</i>

1423
02:38:03,170 --> 02:38:08,370
<i>Or after thunder, silver showers</i>

1424
02:38:09,070 --> 02:38:11,870
<i>Came falling like a rain of flowers</i>

1425
02:38:12,040 --> 02:38:15,950
Oh, that doesn't do them justice
by a long road.

1426
02:38:26,720 --> 02:38:29,420
Take some rest.

1427
02:38:29,630 --> 02:38:32,290
These borders are well-protected.

1428
02:38:32,500 --> 02:38:35,020
I will find no rest here.

1429
02:38:37,870 --> 02:38:40,860
I heard her voice inside my head.

1430
02:38:41,210 --> 02:38:44,830
She spoke of my father
and the fall of Gondor.

1431
02:38:45,040 --> 02:38:50,500
She said to me,
"Even now there is hope left."

1432
02:38:51,880 --> 02:38:54,720
But I cannot see it.

1433
02:38:56,050 --> 02:38:58,550
It is long since we had any hope.

1434
02:39:08,730 --> 02:39:10,860
My father is a noble man.

1435
02:39:11,670 --> 02:39:13,860
But his rule is failing...

1436
02:39:17,010 --> 02:39:19,600
...and our people lose faith.

1437
02:39:21,050 --> 02:39:24,570
He looks to me to make things right,
and I would do it.

1438
02:39:24,750 --> 02:39:28,280
I would see the glory
of Gondor restored.

1439
02:39:31,120 --> 02:39:34,110
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

1440
02:39:34,760 --> 02:39:36,780
The White Tower of Ecthelion.

1441
02:39:36,990 --> 02:39:40,790
Glimmering like a spike
of pearl and silver.

1442
02:39:41,500 --> 02:39:44,990
Its banners caught high
in the morning breeze.

1443
02:39:47,870 --> 02:39:49,860
Have you ever been called home...

1444
02:39:50,040 --> 02:39:53,940
...by the clear ringing
of silver trumpets?

1445
02:39:54,580 --> 02:39:57,810
I have seen the White City...

1446
02:39:58,150 --> 02:39:59,640
...long ago.

1447
02:40:00,620 --> 02:40:05,580
One day, our paths will lead us there.

1448
02:40:06,560 --> 02:40:09,460
And the tower guard
shall take up the call:

1449
02:40:09,930 --> 02:40:13,260
"The Lords of Gondor have returned."

1450
02:41:20,460 --> 02:41:22,990
Will you look into the mirror?

1451
02:41:23,170 --> 02:41:24,690
What will I see?

1452
02:41:27,670 --> 02:41:30,000
Even the wisest cannot tell.

1453
02:41:30,910 --> 02:41:32,740
For the mirror...

1454
02:41:32,980 --> 02:41:35,500
...shows many things.

1455
02:41:38,520 --> 02:41:40,880
Things that were...

1456
02:41:41,120 --> 02:41:43,680
...things that are...

1457
02:41:44,420 --> 02:41:46,390
...and some things...

1458
02:41:49,990 --> 02:41:53,330
...that have not yet come to pass.

1459
02:43:15,850 --> 02:43:18,710
I know what it is you saw.

1460
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:23,610
For it is also in my mind.

1461
02:43:25,390 --> 02:43:29,420
<i>It is what will come to pass
if you should fail.</i>

1462
02:43:31,830 --> 02:43:36,700
<i>The Fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.</i>

1463
02:43:37,340 --> 02:43:40,630
<i>He will try to take the Ring.</i>

1464
02:43:40,840 --> 02:43:42,830
<i>You know of whom I speak.</i>

1465
02:43:43,840 --> 02:43:48,510
<i>One by one, it will destroy them all.</i>

1466
02:43:50,010 --> 02:43:52,450
<i>If you ask it of me...</i>

1467
02:43:52,850 --> 02:43:55,910
<i>...I will give you the One Ring.</i>

1468
02:43:56,950 --> 02:43:59,150
You offer it to me freely.

1469
02:44:03,730 --> 02:44:07,660
I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.

1470
02:44:14,040 --> 02:44:17,300
In place of a Dark Lord,
you would have a queen...

1471
02:44:17,780 --> 02:44:21,580
...not dark but beautiful,
and terrible as the dawn!

1472
02:44:22,210 --> 02:44:25,240
Treacherous as the sea!

1473
02:44:25,750 --> 02:44:30,690
Stronger than the foundations
of the earth!

1474
02:44:31,120 --> 02:44:33,490
All shall love me...

1475
02:44:33,720 --> 02:44:36,560
...and despair.

1476
02:44:50,640 --> 02:44:54,980
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1477
02:44:55,250 --> 02:44:57,710
...and go into the West...

1478
02:44:57,920 --> 02:45:02,350
-...and remain Galadriel.
-I cannot do this alone.

1479
02:45:05,990 --> 02:45:10,120
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a Ring of Power...

1480
02:45:11,030 --> 02:45:12,520
...is to be alone.

1481
02:45:15,970 --> 02:45:18,730
This is Nenya,
the Ring of Adamant.

1482
02:45:18,940 --> 02:45:20,530
And I am its keeper.

1483
02:45:23,740 --> 02:45:27,370
This task was appointed to you.

1484
02:45:28,410 --> 02:45:31,280
And if you do not find a way...

1485
02:45:32,480 --> 02:45:34,470
...no one will.

1486
02:45:34,890 --> 02:45:38,050
Then I know what I must do.

1487
02:45:38,720 --> 02:45:39,920
It's just...

1488
02:45:43,160 --> 02:45:45,420
...I'm afraid to do it.

1489
02:45:48,930 --> 02:45:54,060
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

1490
02:45:59,410 --> 02:46:05,140
Do you know how the Orcs
first came into being?

1491
02:46:05,920 --> 02:46:09,250
They were Elves once.

1492
02:46:10,420 --> 02:46:13,750
Taken by the Dark Powers...

1493
02:46:13,960 --> 02:46:17,120
...tortured and mutilated.

1494
02:46:17,460 --> 02:46:22,760
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1495
02:46:23,030 --> 02:46:24,900
And now...

1496
02:46:26,340 --> 02:46:28,200
...perfected.

1497
02:46:28,940 --> 02:46:32,100
My fighting Uruk-hai...

1498
02:46:34,040 --> 02:46:36,380
...whom do you serve?

1499
02:46:36,550 --> 02:46:39,040
Saruman!

1500
02:46:59,940 --> 02:47:03,340
Hunt them down. Do not stop
until they are found.

1501
02:47:03,540 --> 02:47:06,480
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

1502
02:47:06,680 --> 02:47:09,650
You will taste Man-flesh!

1503
02:47:14,690 --> 02:47:18,380
One of the halflings carries
something of great value.

1504
02:47:18,560 --> 02:47:22,750
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1505
02:47:24,560 --> 02:47:25,860
Kill the others.

1506
02:47:45,050 --> 02:47:50,510
Never before have we clad strangers
in the garb of our own people.

1507
02:47:51,560 --> 02:47:55,360
May these cloaks help shield you
from unfriendly eyes.

1508
02:48:02,570 --> 02:48:04,190
Lembas.

1509
02:48:04,440 --> 02:48:06,030
Elvish waybread.

1510
02:48:08,540 --> 02:48:11,530
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

1511
02:48:18,020 --> 02:48:19,980
How many did you eat?

1512
02:48:20,150 --> 02:48:21,810
Four.

1513
02:48:27,590 --> 02:48:30,220
<i>Every league you travel south,
the danger will increase.</i>

1514
02:48:30,390 --> 02:48:34,520
<i>Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore
of the Anduin.</i>

1515
02:48:34,700 --> 02:48:37,190
<i>Nor will you find safety
on the western bank.</i>

1516
02:48:37,280 --> 02:48:41,310
Strange creatures bearing the mark of the
White Hand have been seen on our borders.

1517
02:48:41,410 --> 02:48:46,500
Seldom do Orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

1518
02:48:54,640 --> 02:48:56,760
You are being tracked.

1519
02:48:59,190 --> 02:49:03,790
By river you have the chance of outrunning
the enemy to the Falls of Rauros.

1520
02:49:21,110 --> 02:49:25,910
My gift for you, Legolas,
is a bow of the Galadhrim.

1521
02:49:26,080 --> 02:49:29,580
Worthy of the skill
of our woodland kin.

1522
02:49:34,960 --> 02:49:37,430
These are the daggers of the Noldorin.

1523
02:49:37,590 --> 02:49:41,590
They have already seen service in war.

1524
02:49:41,770 --> 02:49:44,060
Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.

1525
02:49:44,230 --> 02:49:47,530
<i>You will find your courage.</i>

1526
02:49:49,410 --> 02:49:51,400
<i>And for you, Samwise Gamgee...</i>

1527
02:49:51,580 --> 02:49:54,100
...Elven rope made of hithlain.

1528
02:49:54,450 --> 02:49:56,570
Thank you, my lady.

1529
02:49:58,420 --> 02:50:01,750
Have you run out
of those nice, shiny daggers?

1530
02:50:08,160 --> 02:50:11,180
And what gift would a dwarf ask
of the Elves?

1531
02:50:11,360 --> 02:50:13,490
Nothing.

1532
02:50:14,130 --> 02:50:17,460
Except to look upon the lady
of the Galadhrim one last time...

1533
02:50:18,100 --> 02:50:23,300
...for she is more fair
than all the jewels beneath the earth.

1534
02:50:30,350 --> 02:50:31,940
Actually...

1535
02:50:32,120 --> 02:50:33,740
There was one thing.

1536
02:50:34,550 --> 02:50:37,210
No, no, I couldn't.
It's quite impossible.

1537
02:50:37,390 --> 02:50:40,190
<i>Stupid to ask.</i>

1538
02:50:42,760 --> 02:50:44,850
<i>I have nothing greater to give...</i>

1539
02:50:45,030 --> 02:50:47,620
...than the gift you already bear.

1540
02:50:49,160 --> 02:50:50,900
For her love,

1541
02:50:51,400 --> 02:50:57,160
I fear the grace of Arwen Evenstar
will diminish.

1542
02:50:57,630 --> 02:51:02,360
I would have her leave these shores,

1543
02:51:02,620 --> 02:51:05,080
and be with her people.

1544
02:51:07,380 --> 02:51:13,560
I would have her take the ship to Valinor.

1545
02:51:13,960 --> 02:51:17,020
That choice is yet before her.

1546
02:51:17,760 --> 02:51:20,660
You have your own choice to make,
Aragorn.

1547
02:51:20,960 --> 02:51:26,800
To rise above the height of all
your fathers since the days of Elendil...

1548
02:51:26,970 --> 02:51:31,300
...or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

1549
02:51:38,080 --> 02:51:39,620
Farewell.

1550
02:51:43,490 --> 02:51:46,420
There is much you have yet to do.

1551
02:51:53,070 --> 02:51:54,760
We shall not meet again...

1552
02:51:54,910 --> 02:51:56,620
Elessar.

1553
02:51:58,900 --> 02:52:02,100
<i>Farewell, Frodo Baggins.</i>

1554
02:52:02,270 --> 02:52:05,710
I give you the light of Eärendil...

1555
02:52:06,540 --> 02:52:08,880
...our most beloved star.

1556
02:52:18,020 --> 02:52:22,420
<i>May it be a light for you
in dark places...</i>

1557
02:52:22,630 --> 02:52:26,760
<i>...when all other lights go out.</i>

1558
02:52:35,640 --> 02:52:38,800
I have taken my worst wound
at this parting...

1559
02:52:39,440 --> 02:52:43,740
...having looked my last upon that
which is fairest.

1560
02:52:44,480 --> 02:52:47,810
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

1561
02:52:48,050 --> 02:52:50,020
What was her gift?

1562
02:52:50,190 --> 02:52:55,120
I asked her for one hair
from her golden head.

1563
02:52:55,890 --> 02:52:58,790
She gave me three.

1564
02:54:40,960 --> 02:54:44,400
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

1565
02:54:48,140 --> 02:54:51,230
I had hoped we would lose him
on the river.

1566
02:54:51,480 --> 02:54:54,640
But he's too clever a waterman.

1567
02:54:55,480 --> 02:54:58,780
And if he alerts the enemy
to our whereabouts...

1568
02:54:58,950 --> 02:55:01,180
...it will make the crossing
even more dangerous.

1569
02:55:01,390 --> 02:55:03,440
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

1570
02:55:03,620 --> 02:55:06,680
-No, Sam.
-You haven't eaten anything all day.

1571
02:55:06,890 --> 02:55:09,980
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

1572
02:55:10,930 --> 02:55:13,920
-Mr. Frodo--
-I'm all right.

1573
02:55:14,160 --> 02:55:15,320
But you're not.

1574
02:55:15,630 --> 02:55:18,120
I'm here to help you.

1575
02:55:18,300 --> 02:55:20,000
I promised Gandalf that I would.

1576
02:55:25,980 --> 02:55:28,710
You can't help me, Sam.

1577
02:55:30,850 --> 02:55:32,610
Not this time.

1578
02:55:35,490 --> 02:55:37,610
Get some sleep.

1579
02:55:43,830 --> 02:55:46,020
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

1580
02:55:46,560 --> 02:55:49,330
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

1581
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:52,230
Strike out for Mordor from a place
of strength.

1582
02:55:52,500 --> 02:55:55,370
There is no strength in Gondor
that can avail us.

1583
02:55:55,840 --> 02:55:57,830
You were quick enough to trust
the Elves.

1584
02:55:59,710 --> 02:56:02,540
Have you so little faith
in your own people?

1585
02:56:02,710 --> 02:56:05,710
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

1586
02:56:05,880 --> 02:56:09,220
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in Men.

1587
02:56:09,450 --> 02:56:11,650
But you will not see that.

1588
02:56:11,990 --> 02:56:13,390
You are afraid!

1589
02:56:13,660 --> 02:56:16,220
All your life, you have hidden
in the shadows.

1590
02:56:16,490 --> 02:56:19,950
Scared of who you are,
of what you are.

1591
02:56:22,370 --> 02:56:26,730
I will not lead the Ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

1592
02:56:38,580 --> 02:56:39,910
Frodo.

1593
02:56:41,790 --> 02:56:43,280
The Argonath.

1594
02:56:46,760 --> 02:56:50,490
Long have I desired
to look upon the kings of old.

1595
02:56:51,230 --> 02:56:53,130
My kin.

1596
02:58:12,180 --> 02:58:14,370
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1597
02:58:14,610 --> 02:58:17,170
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1598
02:58:17,380 --> 02:58:20,840
-We approach Mordor from the North.
-Oh, yes?

1599
02:58:21,180 --> 02:58:25,020
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

1600
02:58:25,190 --> 02:58:28,450
...an impassable labyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks.

1601
02:58:28,660 --> 02:58:31,720
And after that, it gets even better.

1602
02:58:32,160 --> 02:58:37,070
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

1603
02:58:37,230 --> 02:58:38,670
That is our road.

1604
02:58:40,200 --> 02:58:43,370
I suggest you take some rest
and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

1605
02:58:43,610 --> 02:58:45,340
Recover my--

1606
02:58:48,350 --> 02:58:50,310
-We should leave now.
-No.

1607
02:58:50,510 --> 02:58:54,920
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

1608
02:58:55,150 --> 02:58:58,610
It is not the eastern shore
that worries me.

1609
02:58:58,820 --> 02:59:02,820
A shadow and a threat
has been growing in my mind.

1610
02:59:03,330 --> 02:59:07,520
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

1611
02:59:09,500 --> 02:59:14,440
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.

1612
02:59:14,940 --> 02:59:16,670
Where's Frodo?

1613
02:59:42,300 --> 02:59:44,230
None of us should wander alone.

1614
02:59:45,600 --> 02:59:47,730
You, least of all.

1615
02:59:47,940 --> 02:59:50,410
So much depends on you.

1616
02:59:51,440 --> 02:59:53,410
Frodo?

1617
03:00:00,480 --> 03:00:03,080
I know why you seek solitude.

1618
03:00:03,790 --> 03:00:07,220
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1619
03:00:07,990 --> 03:00:11,090
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1620
03:00:12,730 --> 03:00:15,390
There are other ways, Frodo.

1621
03:00:15,430 --> 03:00:18,880
-Other paths that we might take.
-I know what you would say.

1622
03:00:19,170 --> 03:00:22,780
And it would seem like wisdom
but for the warning in my heart.

1623
03:00:23,640 --> 03:00:26,730
Warning? Against what?

1624
03:00:26,940 --> 03:00:29,070
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1625
03:00:29,280 --> 03:00:32,910
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

1626
03:00:33,120 --> 03:00:36,920
-...don't you see that is madness?
-There is no other way.

1627
03:00:38,660 --> 03:00:41,990
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

1628
03:00:43,590 --> 03:00:45,620
-If you would but lend me the Ring.
-No.

1629
03:00:46,860 --> 03:00:50,530
-Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
-You are not yourself.

1630
03:00:52,340 --> 03:00:55,670
What chance do you think you have?

1631
03:00:55,870 --> 03:01:00,540
They will find you.
They will take the Ring.

1632
03:01:00,780 --> 03:01:04,470
And you will beg for death
before the end!

1633
03:01:06,620 --> 03:01:08,680
You fool!

1634
03:01:08,890 --> 03:01:12,880
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

1635
03:01:13,060 --> 03:01:15,890
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1636
03:01:16,060 --> 03:01:17,360
-Give it to me!
-No!

1637
03:01:17,530 --> 03:01:19,360
-Give it to me!
-No.

1638
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:29,030
I see your mind.

1639
03:01:29,270 --> 03:01:32,210
You will take the Ring to Sauron!

1640
03:01:32,410 --> 03:01:34,310
You will betray us!

1641
03:01:34,510 --> 03:01:37,710
You'll go to your death,
and the death of us all!

1642
03:01:38,150 --> 03:01:41,810
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

1643
03:01:48,860 --> 03:01:50,380
Frodo?

1644
03:01:54,700 --> 03:01:56,290
Frodo.

1645
03:02:00,200 --> 03:02:02,230
What have I done?

1646
03:02:02,440 --> 03:02:04,170
Please, Frodo.

1647
03:02:04,370 --> 03:02:07,040
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1648
03:02:55,410 --> 03:02:56,840
Frodo?

1649
03:02:58,070 --> 03:03:01,170
-It has taken Boromir.
-Where is the Ring?

1650
03:03:01,380 --> 03:03:03,180
Stay away!

1651
03:03:03,580 --> 03:03:05,170
Frodo!

1652
03:03:07,420 --> 03:03:11,250
-I swore to protect you.
-Can you protect me from yourself?

1653
03:03:20,930 --> 03:03:23,420
Would you destroy it?

1654
03:03:28,410 --> 03:03:30,370
<i>Aragorn.</i>

1655
03:03:33,780 --> 03:03:36,110
<i>Aragorn.</i>

1656
03:03:37,910 --> 03:03:39,780
<i>Elessar.</i>

1657
03:03:47,420 --> 03:03:50,790
I would have gone with you to the end.

1658
03:03:51,460 --> 03:03:54,290
Into the very fires of Mordor.

1659
03:03:57,630 --> 03:03:58,790
I know.

1660
03:04:01,270 --> 03:04:06,730
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

1661
03:04:10,480 --> 03:04:12,210
Go, Frodo!

1662
03:04:15,220 --> 03:04:16,710
Run.

1663
03:04:16,950 --> 03:04:18,610
Run!

1664
03:04:43,180 --> 03:04:44,840
Mr. Frodo!

1665
03:04:54,120 --> 03:04:55,890
Find the halfling!

1666
03:04:57,530 --> 03:05:00,050
Find the halfling!

1667
03:05:03,530 --> 03:05:05,190
Elendil!

1668
03:05:11,710 --> 03:05:13,270
Aragorn, go!

1669
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:36,300
Frodo!

1670
03:05:36,870 --> 03:05:38,490
Hide here. Quick!

1671
03:05:39,100 --> 03:05:40,570
Come on!

1672
03:05:43,040 --> 03:05:45,060
What's he doing?

1673
03:05:49,310 --> 03:05:51,300
He's leaving.

1674
03:05:56,090 --> 03:05:59,020
-No!
-Pippin!

1675
03:06:03,930 --> 03:06:06,260
Run, Frodo. Go on!

1676
03:06:06,830 --> 03:06:09,920
-Hey! Hey, you!
-Over here!

1677
03:06:10,330 --> 03:06:11,930
-Over here!
-This way!

1678
03:06:22,780 --> 03:06:25,110
-It's working!
-I know it's working! Run!

1679
03:07:20,470 --> 03:07:23,530
-The horn of Gondor.
-Boromir.

1680
03:08:06,650 --> 03:08:07,740
Run!

1681
03:11:39,360 --> 03:11:40,950
No.

1682
03:11:44,900 --> 03:11:47,930
-They took the little ones.
-Lay still.

1683
03:11:48,200 --> 03:11:50,230
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1684
03:11:52,110 --> 03:11:53,580
I let Frodo go.

1685
03:11:54,240 --> 03:11:56,870
Then you did what I could not.

1686
03:11:57,880 --> 03:12:01,180
I tried to take the Ring from him.

1687
03:12:01,720 --> 03:12:05,950
-The Ring is beyond our reach now.
-Forgive me.

1688
03:12:06,190 --> 03:12:08,450
I did not see it.

1689
03:12:08,690 --> 03:12:11,890
-I have failed you all.
-No, Boromir.

1690
03:12:12,300 --> 03:12:14,820
You fought bravely.

1691
03:12:15,130 --> 03:12:17,790
You have kept your honor.

1692
03:12:18,430 --> 03:12:20,300
Leave it.

1693
03:12:20,640 --> 03:12:22,730
It is over.

1694
03:12:23,940 --> 03:12:29,140
The world of Men will fall.
And all will come to darkness...

1695
03:12:29,610 --> 03:12:32,600
...and my city to ruin.

1696
03:12:36,650 --> 03:12:39,420
I do not know what strength
is in my blood...

1697
03:12:39,590 --> 03:12:43,580
...but I swear to you,
I will not let the White City fall...

1698
03:12:44,590 --> 03:12:47,090
...nor our people fail.

1699
03:12:48,030 --> 03:12:49,430
Our people.

1700
03:12:53,270 --> 03:12:55,330
Our people.

1701
03:13:17,130 --> 03:13:20,120
I would have followed you, my brother.

1702
03:13:21,660 --> 03:13:23,660
My captain.

1703
03:13:26,300 --> 03:13:28,200
My king.

1704
03:13:47,860 --> 03:13:50,090
Be at peace...

1705
03:13:50,490 --> 03:13:52,480
...son of Gondor.

1706
03:14:08,950 --> 03:14:12,310
They will look for his coming
from the White Tower.

1707
03:14:12,820 --> 03:14:15,810
But he will not return.

1708
03:14:39,040 --> 03:14:41,030
Frodo!

1709
03:15:00,460 --> 03:15:03,760
<i>I wish the Ring had never come to me.</i>

1710
03:15:05,000 --> 03:15:07,990
<i>I wish none of this had happened.</i>

1711
03:15:10,970 --> 03:15:13,770
<i>So do all who live
to see such times...</i>

1712
03:15:13,940 --> 03:15:17,440
<i>...but that is not for them to decide.</i>

1713
03:15:17,610 --> 03:15:20,240
<i>All you have to decide...</i>

1714
03:15:20,450 --> 03:15:25,180
...is what to do with the time
that is given to you.

1715
03:15:54,020 --> 03:15:56,110
Frodo, no!

1716
03:15:56,650 --> 03:15:57,950
Frodo!

1717
03:15:58,720 --> 03:16:01,420
-Mr. Frodo!
-No, Sam.

1718
03:16:04,960 --> 03:16:06,930
Go back, Sam!

1719
03:16:07,430 --> 03:16:10,990
-I'm going to Mordor alone.
-Of course you are.

1720
03:16:11,200 --> 03:16:14,030
And I'm coming with you!

1721
03:16:14,540 --> 03:16:16,970
You can't swim!

1722
03:16:20,740 --> 03:16:22,470
Sam!

1723
03:16:28,050 --> 03:16:29,380
Sam!

1724
03:17:10,290 --> 03:17:13,020
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1725
03:17:13,360 --> 03:17:17,700
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

1726
03:17:18,800 --> 03:17:21,430
And I don't mean to.

1727
03:17:21,700 --> 03:17:23,870
I don't mean to.

1728
03:17:25,380 --> 03:17:27,370
Oh Sam.

1729
03:17:42,260 --> 03:17:43,920
Come on.

1730
03:18:12,350 --> 03:18:16,920
Hurry! Frodo and Sam
have reached the eastern shore.

1731
03:18:31,810 --> 03:18:36,800
-You mean not to follow them.
-Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1732
03:18:40,220 --> 03:18:45,120
Then it has all been in vain.
The Fellowship has failed.

1733
03:18:56,970 --> 03:19:00,130
Not if we hold true to each other.

1734
03:19:01,500 --> 03:19:05,960
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin
to torment and death.

1735
03:19:06,980 --> 03:19:12,210
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1736
03:19:13,520 --> 03:19:15,540
We travel light.

1737
03:19:15,720 --> 03:19:17,650
Let us hunt some Orc.

1738
03:19:20,620 --> 03:19:22,650
Yes!

1739
03:19:41,640 --> 03:19:43,080
Mordor.

1740
03:19:43,710 --> 03:19:47,080
I hope the others find a safer road.

1741
03:19:48,020 --> 03:19:50,580
Strider will look after them.

1742
03:19:51,520 --> 03:19:54,890
I don't suppose
we'll ever see them again.

1743
03:19:55,220 --> 03:19:57,660
