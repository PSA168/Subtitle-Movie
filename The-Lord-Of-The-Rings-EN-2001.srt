3
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,663
Female voice:
The world is changed.

4
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:40,791
I feel it in the water.

5
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:44,461
I feel it in the earth.

6
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,049
I smell it in the air.

7
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,426
Much that once was...

8
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,136
Is lost.

9
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:56,848
For none now live who remember it.

10
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:14,157
It began with the forging
of the great rings.

11
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,368
Three were given to the elves:

12
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:20,289
Immortal, wisest and fairest
of all beings.

13
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,417
Seven to the dwarf-lords:

14
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:28,589
Great miners and craftsmen
of the mountain halls.

15
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,382
And nine...

16
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:33,594
Nine rings were gifted
to the race of men...

17
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:37,556
Who, above all else, desire power.

18
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:43,895
For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race.

19
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:48,567
But they were all of them deceived.

20
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,902
For another ring was made.

21
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:55,324
In the land of mordor,
in the fires of mount doom...

22
00:01:55,741 --> 00:02:00,287
The dark lord Sauron forged
in secret a master ring...

23
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,539
To control all others.

24
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:06,710
And into this ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...

25
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:11,048
And his will to dominate all life.

26
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:15,886
One ring to rule them all.

27
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,472
One by one...

28
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:23,352
The free lands of middle-earth
fell to the power of the ring.

29
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:26,521
But there were some who resisted.

30
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,735
A last alliance of men and elves
marched against the armies of mordor.

31
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:36,490
And on the slopes of mount doom, they
fought for the freedom of middle-earth.

32
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,439
Victory was near.

33
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,946
But the power of the ring...

34
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,198
Could not be undone.

35
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,808
It was in this moment...

36
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,394
When all hope had faded...

37
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:51,648
That isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.

38
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:29,227
Sauron, the enemy of the free peoples
of middle-earth, was defeated.

39
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,361
The ring passed to isildur...

40
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:42,699
Who had this one chance
to destroy evil forever.

41
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,619
But the hearts of men...

42
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,246
Are easily corrupted.

43
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:53,126
And the ring of power
has a will of its own.

44
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,946
It betrayed isildur...

45
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,200
To his death.

46
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:33,333
And some things
that should not have been forgotten...

47
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,794
Were lost.

48
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,922
History became legend...

49
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,132
Legend became myth.

50
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:44,177
And for
two and a half thousand years...

51
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:48,014
The ring passed
out of all knowledge.

52
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,476
Until, when chance came...

53
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,272
It ensnared a new bearer.

54
00:05:56,606 --> 00:06:01,444
Gollum: My precious.

55
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,281
Female voice: The ring came
to the creature gollum...

56
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:08,326
Who took it deep into the tunnels
of the misty mountains.

57
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,496
And there it consumed him.

58
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,874
Gollum: It came to me.

59
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:18,503
My own. My love. My own.

60
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:23,341
My precious.

61
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,473
Female voice: The ring brought
to gollum unnatural long life.

62
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:34,519
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

63
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:39,316
And in the gloom of gollum's cave,
it waited.

64
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,694
Darkness crept back
into the forests of the world.

65
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,864
Rumor grew of a shadow in the east...

66
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,867
Whispers of a nameless fear.

67
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,370
And the ring of power perceived...

68
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,290
Its time had now come.

69
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,378
It abandoned gollum.

70
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:05,550
But something happened then
the ring did not intend.

71
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:11,056
It was picked up by the most unlikely
creature imaginable.

72
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,307
Bilbo: What's this?

73
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,934
Female voice: A hobbit.

74
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,895
Bilbo Baggins of the shire.

75
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,855
A ring.

76
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,857
Gollum: Losfl

77
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,155
my precious is lost!

78
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,574
Female voice:
For the time will soon come...

79
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:34,996
When hobbits will shape
the fortunes of all.

80
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:42,879
Bilbo:
The 22nd day of September...

81
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,214
In the year 1400...

82
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,051
By shire-reckoning.

83
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:54,140
Bag end, bagshot row, hobbiton,
westfarthing...

84
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,935
The shire...

85
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,862
The third age of this world.

86
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:23,420
There and back again:

87
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,466
By bilbo Baggins.

88
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,185
Where to begin?

89
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,521
Ah, yes...

90
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,694
"Concerning...

91
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:55,243
Hobbits have been living and farming
in the four farthings of the shire...

92
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,412
For many hundreds of years...

93
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,582
Quite content to ignore
and be ignored...

94
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,877
By the world of the big folk.

95
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:09,924
Middle-earth being, after all,
full of strange creatures beyond count...

96
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:13,261
Hobbits must seem
of little importance...

97
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:17,474
Being neither renowned
as great warriors...

98
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:21,811
Nor counted among the very wise.

99
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:29,194
Frodo! Someone at the door.

100
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,947
In fact, it has been remarked by some...

101
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:37,660
That hobbits' only real passion
is for food.

102
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,246
A rather unfair observation...

103
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,084
As we have also developed a keen
interest in the brewing of ales...

104
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:47,212
And the smoking of pipe-weed.

105
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,548
But where our hearts truly lie...

106
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,842
Is in peace and quiet...

107
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,720
And good, tilled earth.

108
00:09:55,804 --> 00:10:01,059
For all hobbits share a love
of things that grow.

109
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:08,691
And, yes, no doubt to others,
our ways seem quaint.

110
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:14,030
But today of all days,
it is brought home to me:

111
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:20,495
It is no bad thing
to celebrate a simple life.

112
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,877
Frodo, the door!

113
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,994
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

114
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:44,894
Male voice:
Down from the door where it began

115
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:53,403
And I must follow if! Can

116
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:58,491
the road goes ever on and on

117
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:02,287
down from the door where it began

118
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:07,375
now far ahead the road has gone

119
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:11,796
-and I must follow if! Can
-you're late.

120
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,887
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

121
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:24,309
Nor is he early. He arrives
precisely when he means to.

122
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,781
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

123
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:46,331
You didn't think I'd miss
your uncle bilbo's birthday?

124
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,168
How is the old rascal?

125
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:54,297
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

126
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,883
You know bilbo.
He's got the whole place in an uproar.

127
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,052
Well, that should please him.

128
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,012
Half the shire's been invited.

129
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,932
And the rest of them are turning up
anyway.

130
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,438
Bilbo:
And so life in the shire goes on...

131
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,691
Very much as it has
this past age...

132
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:19,405
Full of its own comings and goings,
with change coming slowly.

133
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,449
If it comes at all.

134
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,204
For things are made to endure
in the shire...

135
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,832
Passing from one generation
to the next.

136
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:35,255
There's always been a Baggins
living here under the hill...

137
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,714
In bag end.

138
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,345
And there always will be.

139
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,391
To tell you the truth,
bilbo's been a bit odd lately.

140
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,019
I mean, more than usual.

141
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,981
He's taken to locking himself
in his study.

142
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:58,695
He spends hours poring over old maps
when he thinks I'm not looking.

143
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,042
Where's it gone?

144
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,904
He's up to something.

145
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,623
- All right, then. Keep your secrets.
- What?

146
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,500
But I know you have something
to do with it.

147
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:55,835
Good gracious me.

148
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,963
Before you came along, we bagginses
were very well thought of.

149
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,089
Indeed.

150
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,592
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

151
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:09,140
If you're referring to the incident
with the dragon, I was barely involved.

152
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,935
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

153
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:17,106
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

154
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,442
Oh, really?

155
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,033
Gandalf! Gandalf!

156
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,522
Female hobbit 1:
Fireworks, Gandalf!

157
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,046
Female hobbit 2: Gandalf!
Male hobbit: Fireworks, Gandalf!

158
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:04,612
- I'm glad you're back.
- So am I, dear boy.

159
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,827
So am I.

160
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,472
Whoa, whoa.

161
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,235
Bilbo: No, thank you!

162
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:48,406
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

163
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:52,034
And what about very old friends?

164
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,085
- Bilbo Baggins.
- My dear Gandalf!

165
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:06,382
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

166
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,136
You haven't aged a day.

167
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,769
Come on, come in!

168
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,355
Welcome, welcome.

169
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,067
Oh, here we are.

170
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,238
Tea? Or maybe something
a little stronger?

171
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:33,242
I've got a few bottles
of the old winyard left. 1296.

172
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:37,413
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

173
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:43,127
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

174
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,922
Just tea, thank you.

175
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,136
Oh!

176
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,930
I was expecting you sometime
last week.

177
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,433
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

178
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:02,980
You caught me a bit unprepared. We've only
got cold chicken and a bit of pickle...

179
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:06,442
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

180
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:10,613
We've got raspberry jam,
an apple tart...

181
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,326
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.

182
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,287
I've just found some sponge cake.

183
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,687
I could make you some eggs
if you'd...

184
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,965
- Just tea, thank you.
- Oh, right.

185
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,510
- You don't mind if I eat, do you?
- No, not at all.

186
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,536
Female hobbit:
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

187
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,223
I'm not at home!

188
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,856
It's the sackville-bagginses.

189
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,109
- I know you're in there!
- They're after the house.

190
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,362
They've never forgiven me
for living this long.

191
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,383
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...

192
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,325
Never giving me a moment's peace.

193
00:17:57,118 --> 00:18:00,705
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!

194
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:05,376
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

195
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:09,547
- So you mean to go through with your plan?
- Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

196
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,966
All the arrangements are made.

197
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,511
Oh, thank you.

198
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,389
Frodo suspects something.

199
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,017
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

200
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,853
Not some blockheaded bracegirdle
from hardbottle.

201
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,189
You will tell him, won't you?

202
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,151
- Yes, yes.
- He's very fond of you.

203
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,863
I know.

204
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,535
He'd probably come with me
if I asked him.

205
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,664
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the shire.

206
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,585
The woods, the fields.

207
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,046
Little rivers.

208
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,219
I am old, Gandalf.

209
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:03,893
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

210
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,606
I feel thin.

211
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,399
Sort of stretched...

212
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:15,112
Like butter scraped
over too much bread.

213
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:19,784
I need a holiday. A very long holiday.

214
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:23,204
And I don't expect I shall return.

215
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,584
In fact, I mean not to.

216
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:35,383
Old Toby. The finest weed
in the southfarthing.

217
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,319
Gandalf, my old friend...

218
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:58,280
This will be a night to remember.

219
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,138
Bilbo: Hello, hello.

220
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:26,475
Fatty bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

221
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,104
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

222
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:36,277
- I think I'll just have another ale.
- Oh, no, you don't.

223
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,113
Go on!

224
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,000
So there I was...

225
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:55,379
At the mercy
of three monstrous trolls.

226
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,548
And they were all arguing
amongst themselves...

227
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,217
About how they were
going to cook us.

228
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:05,347
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

229
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:10,019
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

230
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,689
That the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...

231
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,193
And turned them all to stone!

232
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,866
Merry: Quickly.

233
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,039
Up they go!

234
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,210
No, the big one.

235
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,263
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

236
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:48,390
Are all these children yours?

237
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:51,519
Good gracious,
you have been productive.

238
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:54,855
Female hobbit: Bilbo?

239
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,234
Sackville-bagginses!

240
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,568
Quickly, hide!

241
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,580
Thank you, my boy.

242
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,501
You're a good lad, Frodo.

243
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,588
I'm very selfish, you know.

244
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,467
Yes, I am. Very selfish.

245
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:25,946
I don't know why I took you in
after your mother and father died...

246
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,555
But it wasn't out of charity.

247
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:29,765
I think it was because...

248
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,226
Of all my numerous relations...

249
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:36,021
You were the one Baggins
that showed real spirit.

250
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,148
Bilbo, have you been
at the gaffer's home brew?

251
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:42,987
Well, yes, but that's not the point.

252
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,407
The point is, Frodo...

253
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,453
You'll be all right.

254
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,001
- Done!
- You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

255
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,669
- It is in the ground.
- Outside!

256
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,296
This was your idea.

257
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,692
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

258
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:25,154
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for a thousand years.

259
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:42,338
- That was good.
- Let's get another one.

260
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:48,135
Gandalf:
Meriadoc brandybuck and peregrin took.

261
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,137
I might've known.

262
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:58,103
Female hobbit: Speech, bilbo!

263
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,397
Male hobbit: Speech!

264
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:01,607
Speech!

265
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,156
My dear bagginses and boffins...

266
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,201
Tooks and brandybucks...

267
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,912
Grubbs, chubbs...

268
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,080
Hornblowers...

269
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:18,874
Bolgers...

270
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,918
Bracegirdles...

271
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,671
- And proudfoots.
- Proudfeet!

272
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,009
Today is my 111th birthday!

273
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,429
Happy birthday!

274
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:36,892
But alas, eleventy-one years is
far too short a time to live among...

275
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,895
Such excellent
and admirable hobbits.

276
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,607
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

277
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:48,362
And I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

278
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,492
I, uh—...

279
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,708
I have things to do.

280
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,216
I've put this off far too long.

281
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:17,016
I regret to announce this is the end!

282
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,351
I'm going now.

283
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:23,355
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

284
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:26,942
Good bye.

285
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:03,353
I suppose you think
that was terribly clever.

286
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:06,940
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

287
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:12,196
There are many magic rings in this world,
and none of them should be used lightly.

288
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,573
It was just a bit of fun.

289
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:18,410
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

290
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:23,373
- You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
- Two eyes.

291
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:26,293
As often as I can spare them.

292
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,671
- I'm leaving everything to him.
- What about this ring of yours?

293
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:33,133
- Is that staying too?
- Yes, yes.

294
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:37,638
It's in an envelope over there
on the mantelpiece.

295
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,683
No. Wait, it's...

296
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,855
Here in my pocket.

297
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,738
Isn't that...? Isn't that odd, now?

298
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:59,868
Yet, after all, why not?

299
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:06,333
- Why shouldn't I keep it?
- I think you should leave the ring behind.

300
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,002
Is that so hard?

301
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:10,462
Well, no.

302
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,383
And yes.

303
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:19,388
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel like parting with it.

304
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,431
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

305
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:25,811
- There's no need to get angry.
- Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

306
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,063
It's mine.

307
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,817
My own.

308
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:36,196
- My precious.
- Precious?

309
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,283
It's been called that before,
but not by you.

310
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,077
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

311
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,913
I think you've had that ring
quite long enough.

312
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:48,083
- You want it for yourself!
- Bilbo Baggins!

313
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:52,421
Do not take me for some conjurer
of cheap tricks.

314
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:56,341
I am not trying to Rob you.

315
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,098
I'm trying to help you.

316
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:14,902
All your long years,
we've been friends.

317
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,446
Trust me as you once did.

318
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:21,116
Let it go.

319
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,661
You're right, Gandalf.

320
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,458
The ring must go to Frodo.

321
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,837
It's late. The road is long.

322
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:36,465
Yes, it is time.

323
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:44,306
The ring is still in your pocket.

324
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:22,010
I've thought up an ending for my book:

325
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,725
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

326
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:32,312
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

327
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:34,815
Goodbye, Gandalf.

328
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:40,195
Goodbye, dear bilbo.

329
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:52,207
Bilbo:
The road goes ever on and on

330
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:57,129
until our next meeting.

331
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:28,243
Bilbo: It's mine. My own.

332
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:31,788
My precious.

333
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:44,926
My precious.

334
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,805
Precious.

335
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:51,516
He's gone, hasn't he?

336
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:57,314
He talked for so long about leaving...

337
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,275
I didn't think he'd really do it.

338
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:16,583
Bilbo's ring.

339
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:19,336
He's gone to stay with the elves.

340
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,589
He's left you bag end.

341
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:28,804
Along with all his possessions.

342
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,807
The ring is yours now.

343
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:37,979
- Put it somewhere out of sight.
- Where are you going?

344
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,440
- There are some things that I must see to.
- What things?

345
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:44,820
- —Questions. Questions that need answering.
- You've only just arrived.

346
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:48,323
I don't understand.

347
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:58,333
Keep it secret.

348
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,210
Keep it safe.

349
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,372
Gollum: Shire!

350
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:40,834
Baggins!

351
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:32,344
Gandalf:
"The year 3434 of the second age.

352
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:36,973
Here follows the account of isildur,
high king of gondor...

353
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:40,769
And the finding
of the ring of power."

354
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,149
"It has come to me.

355
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:49,819
The one ring. It shall be
an heirloom of my kingdom.

356
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:53,490
All those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate...

357
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:57,494
For I will risk
no hurt to the ring.

358
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:00,121
It is precious to me...

359
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:03,625
Though I buy it with great pain.

360
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:10,966
The markings upon the band
begin to fade.

361
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:15,971
The writing, which at first was as clear
as red flame, has all but disappeared.

362
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:20,267
A secret now
that only fire can tell."

363
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,955
Baggins.

364
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:46,501
There's no bagginses around here.
They're all up in hobbiton.

365
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,671
That way.

366
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:57,929
To heal my heart and drown my woe

367
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,432
rain may fall and wind may blow

368
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,227
many miles to go

369
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:06,354
sweet is the sound of the pouring rain

370
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,732
and the stream that falls
from hill to plain

371
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,734
better than rain or rippling brook

372
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,278
is a mug of beer inside this took

373
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:19,534
there's been some strange folk
crossing the shire.

374
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:23,830
Dwarves and others of a less
than savory nature.

375
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:25,707
War is brewing.

376
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:29,294
The mountains are fair teeming
with goblins.

377
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:32,088
Far-off tales and children's stories,
that's all that is.

378
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:36,760
You're beginning to sound like that old
bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.

379
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,929
Young Mr. Frodo here,
he's cracking.

380
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:41,556
And proud of it.

381
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,975
- Cheers, gaffer.
- Cheers.

382
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:48,271
It's none of our concern what goes on
beyond our borders.

383
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:52,734
Keep your nose out of trouble,
and no trouble'll come to you.

384
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,323
- Good night, lads.
- Good night.

385
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:02,994
Good night, sweet maiden
of the golden ale.

386
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:05,580
Mind who you're sweet-talking.

387
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:10,251
Don't worry, Sam. Rosie knows an idiot
when she sees one.

388
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,420
Does she?

389
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:16,091
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Mr. Frodo.

390
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,368
Is it secret? Is it safe?

391
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:54,379
What are you doing?

392
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:09,519
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

393
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:10,812
It's quite cool.

394
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,151
What can you see?

395
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:20,321
Can you see anything?

396
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,492
Nothing.

397
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:27,120
There's nothing.

398
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,664
Wait.

399
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:36,004
There are markings.

400
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:41,009
It's some form of elvish.
I can't read it.

401
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,678
There are few who can.

402
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:49,058
The language is that of mordor,
which I will not utter here.

403
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:53,104
In the common tongue, it says:

404
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:56,733
"One ring to rule them all...

405
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,402
One ring to find them...

406
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,696
One ring to bring them all...

407
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:05,033
And in the darkness bind them."

408
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,745
This is the one ring...

409
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:14,250
Forged by the dark lord Sauron
in the fires of mount doom.

410
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:18,379
Taken by isildur
from the hand of Sauron himself.

411
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:21,716
Bilbo found it.

412
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,093
- In gollum's cave.
- Yes.

413
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:28,932
For 60 years, the ring lay quiet
in bilbo's keeping...

414
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:32,477
Prolonging his life,
delaying old age.

415
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:37,607
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in mordor.

416
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,109
The ring has awoken.

417
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,154
It's heard its master's call.

418
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:47,200
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

419
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:54,999
Gandalf: No, Frodo.

420
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:59,295
The spirit of Sauron endured.

421
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:04,759
His life force is bound to the ring,
and the ring survived.

422
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:07,262
Sauron has returned.

423
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,306
His orcs have multiplied.

424
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:14,519
His fortress at barad-dur
is rebuilt in the land of mordor.

425
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:19,524
Sauron needs only this ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

426
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,818
He is seeking it.

427
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:25,780
Seeking it. All his thought
is bent on it.

428
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,825
For the ring yearns above all else...

429
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:32,328
To return to the hand
of its master.

430
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,414
They are one...

431
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:37,667
The ring and the dark lord.

432
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,835
Frodo...

433
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:41,337
He must never find it.

434
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:42,547
Frodo: All right.

435
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:47,218
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

436
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:50,054
No one knows it's here, do they?

437
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:56,936
Do they, Gandalf?

438
00:39:57,979 --> 00:40:01,357
There is one other who knew
that bilbo had the ring.

439
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,695
I looked everywhere
for the creature gollum.

440
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,072
But the enemy found him first.

441
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,243
Gandalf: I don't know how long
they tortured him.

442
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:16,956
But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words:

443
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,250
Gollum: Shire!

444
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,085
Baggins!

445
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:26,174
Baggins. But that would
lead them here!

446
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,011
Who goes there?

447
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:32,972
Take it, Gandalf!

448
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:34,474
- Take it!
- No, Frodo.

449
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:37,060
- You must take it!
- You cannot offer me this ring!

450
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:40,521
- I'm giving it to you!
- Don't tempt me, Frodo!

451
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:44,233
I dare not take it.

452
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:47,028
Not even to keep it safe.

453
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:50,198
Understand, Frodo...

454
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:54,494
I would use this ring
from a desire to do good.

455
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:05,630
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

456
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:09,133
- But it cannot stay in the shire!
- No.

457
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,637
No, it can't.

458
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,352
What must I do?

459
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,607
- You must leave. And leave quickly.
- Where? Where do I go?

460
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:28,027
Get out of the shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

461
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,445
Bree.

462
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:32,448
- What about you?
- I'll be waiting for you...

463
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:35,118
At the inn of the prancing pony.

464
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:39,038
- And the ring will be safe there?
- I don't know, Frodo.

465
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:41,165
I don't have any answers.

466
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:48,297
I must see the head of my order. He is
both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

467
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:50,550
He'll know what to do.

468
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,970
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

469
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:56,764
That name is not safe
outside the shire.

470
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:00,685
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

471
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,480
I can cut across country
easily enough.

472
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:08,317
My dear Frodo.

473
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,696
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

474
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,824
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

475
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:17,368
And yet, after a hundred years...

476
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,662
They can still surprise you.

477
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,498
Get down.

478
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:38,306
Confound it all, samwise gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

479
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:42,977
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.
I was cutting the grass under the window.

480
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,605
A little late for trimming the verge,
don't you think?

481
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:48,691
- I heard raised voices.
- What did you hear? Speak!

482
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:49,859
Nothing important.

483
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:54,614
That is, I heard a good deal about a ring,
a dark lord and the end of the world but...

484
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:59,494
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

485
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,165
Perhaps not.

486
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:08,836
I've thought of a better use for you.

487
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:13,549
Gandalf:
Come along, samwise. Keep up.

488
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:17,428
Be careful, both of you.

489
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:20,431
The enemy has many spies
in his service:

490
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:23,518
Birds, beasts.

491
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,063
Is it safe?

492
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:30,233
Never put it on...

493
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:33,778
For the agents of the dark lord
will be drawn to its power.

494
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,404
Always remember, Frodo...

495
00:43:35,905 --> 00:43:39,075
The ring is trying to get back
to its master.

496
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:41,577
It wants to be found.

497
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,914
This is what?

498
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,250
If I take one more step...

499
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:33,629
It'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

500
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,427
Come on, Sam.

501
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,645
Remember what bilbo used to say:

502
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:54,025
-"It's a dangerous business, Frodo."
Bilbo: "Going out your door.

503
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:58,654
You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet...

504
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:02,950
There's no knowing where
you might be swept off to."

505
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,429
Wood-elves.

506
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,655
They're going to the harbor
beyond the white towers.

507
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:42,990
To the grey havens.

508
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,660
Sam:
They're leaving middle-earth.

509
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,995
Frodo: Never to return.

510
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,000
I don't know why...

511
00:45:53,668 --> 00:45:56,087
It makes me sad.

512
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:02,802
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

513
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:05,263
Just shut your eyes...

514
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:08,224
And imagine you're back
in your own bed...

515
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:12,311
With a soft mattress
and a lovely feather pillow.

516
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,365
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

517
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,368
I'm never going to be able
to sleep out here.

518
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:32,039
Me neither, Sam.

519
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:03,654
Male voice: Smoke rises
from the mountain of doom.

520
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:05,531
The hour grows late.

521
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:09,285
And Gandalf the grey
rides to lsengard...

522
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,954
Seeking my counsel.

523
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:16,125
For that is why you have come,
is it not?

524
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:17,543
My old friend.

525
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:19,420
Saruman.

526
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:27,261
Saruman: You are sure of this?
Gandalf: Beyond any doubt.

527
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:30,348
So the ring of power has been found.

528
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:33,768
All these long years,
it was in the shire.

529
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:37,063
- Under my very nose.
- Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

530
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:42,193
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

531
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:47,114
But we still have time. Time enough
to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

532
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:48,699
Time?

533
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:52,244
What time do you think we have?

534
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:56,624
Sauron has regained
much of his former strength.

535
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,959
He cannot yet take physical form...

536
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,921
But his spirit has lost
none of its potency.

537
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:07,635
Concealed within his fortress,
the lord of mordor sees all.

538
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:14,141
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow,
earth and flesh.

539
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:18,813
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

540
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:24,985
A great eye, lidless,
wreathed in flame.

541
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:27,822
The eye of Sauron.

542
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,616
He is gathering all evil to him.

543
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:33,285
Very soon, he'll have summoned
an army great enough...

544
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:35,621
For an assault upon middle-earth.

545
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:38,332
You know this?

546
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,334
How?

547
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,628
I have seen it.

548
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:46,257
A palantir is a dangerous tool,
saruman.

549
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:48,467
Why?

550
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,637
Why should we fear to use it?

551
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:58,227
They are not all accounted for,
the lost seeing-stones.

552
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,605
We do not know who else
may be watching.

553
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,986
The hour is later than you think.

554
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,447
Sauron's forces are already moving.

555
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,452
The nine have left minas morgul.

556
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:15,911
The nine?

557
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:19,165
They crossed the river isen
on midsummer's Eve...

558
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:22,042
Disguised as riders in black.

559
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:26,130
- They've reached the shire?
- They will find the ring.

560
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:29,967
And kill the one who carries it.

561
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:48,986
You did not seriously think that a hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

562
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:52,531
There are none who can.

563
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:57,786
Against the power of mordor...

564
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:00,581
There can be no victory.

565
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:05,711
We mustjoin with him, Gandalf.

566
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,340
We mustjoin with Sauron.

567
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,678
It would be wise, my friend.

568
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,639
Tell me...

569
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:17,848
Friend...

570
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:23,395
When did saruman the wise
abandon reason for madness?

571
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,603
I gave you the chance...

572
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,440
Of aiding me willingly...

573
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:12,736
But you have elected
the way of pain!

574
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,511
Sam: Mr. Frodo?

575
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:39,930
Frodo? Frodo!

576
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:44,643
- I thought I'd lost you.
- What are you talking about?

577
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:47,771
- It's just something Gandalf said.
- What did he say?

578
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:52,484
"Don't you lose him, samwise gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

579
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:56,363
Sam, we're still in the shire.
What could possibly happen?

580
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:00,367
Frodo.

581
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:02,911
- Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
- Hello, Frodo.

582
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:04,455
Get off him.

583
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,498
Come on, Frodo.

584
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:08,500
Frodo:
What's the meaning of this?

585
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,711
You've been into farmer maggot's crop!

586
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,341
Maggot: You get back here!

587
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:17,718
Get out of my field!

588
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,763
You'll know the devil
if I catch up with you!

589
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:23,891
Merry: I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

590
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,184
Pippin: And some cabbages.

591
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:28,270
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

592
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:32,566
- And then the mushrooms the week before.
- Merry: Yes, pippin. My point is...

593
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,943
He's clearly overreacting.

594
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:52,586
Oh, that was close.

595
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:56,799
I think I've broken something.

596
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,219
Trust a brandybuck and a took!

597
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:04,056
What? That was just a detour.
A short cut.

598
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,433
- Short cut to what?
- Mushrooms!

599
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,694
Pippin: That's mine.

600
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,073
That's nice, merry.

601
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,701
Merry: Here's a nice one, Sam.

602
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:26,370
I think we should get off the road.

603
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:37,005
Get off the road!

604
00:53:37,089 --> 00:53:38,632
Quick!

605
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,813
Be quiet!

606
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,298
What was that?

607
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,499
Sam: Anything?

608
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,668
Nothing.

609
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:40,671
What is going on?

610
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:45,008
That black rider was looking
for something. Or someone.

611
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,845
Frodo?

612
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:49,596
Get down!

613
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:08,782
I have to leave the shire.

614
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,160
Sam and I must get to Bree.

615
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:13,704
Right.

616
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,374
Bucklebury ferry. Follow me.

617
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,009
Pippin: Run!

618
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,220
Merry: This way! Follow me!

619
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:34,808
Pippin: Run!

620
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,823
Merry: Get the rope, Sam!

621
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,163
Pippin: Run, Frodo!

622
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:57,664
Frodo: Go! Pippin: Hurry!

623
00:56:57,748 --> 00:57:00,417
Merry: Frodo, come on!

624
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:03,337
Sam: Come on! Faster!
Pippin: Jump!

625
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:22,522
- How far to the nearest crossing?
- The brandywine bridge. 20 miles.

626
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,622
Come on.

627
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,220
- What do you want?
- We're heading for the prancing pony.

628
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:03,689
What's more, out of the shire by your
talk. What business brings you to Bree?

629
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:07,234
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.

630
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:10,862
All right, young sir.
I meant no offense.

631
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:13,573
It's my job to ask questions
after nightfall.

632
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:16,576
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

633
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,870
Can't be too careful.

634
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:42,102
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

635
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:07,878
Excuse me.

636
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:11,757
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?

637
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:18,055
If you're seeking accommodation, we got
some cozy hobbit-sized rooms available.

638
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:22,809
Always proud to cater
to the little folk, mister...?

639
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:26,021
Underhill. My name's underhill.

640
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:29,858
- Underhill, yes.
- We're friends of Gandalf the grey.

641
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:33,153
- Can you tell him we've arrived?
- Gandalf?

642
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:37,908
Oh, yes...

643
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:40,160
I remember. Elderly chap.

644
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:43,413
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

645
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,665
Not seen him for six months.

646
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:53,715
What do we do now?

647
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:04,226
He'll be here. He'll come.

648
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,064
Man: Get out of my way!

649
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,110
What's that?

650
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,904
This, my friend, is a pint.

651
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:17,697
It comes in pints?

652
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:21,743
- I'm getting one.
- You got a whole half already!

653
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:31,920
That fellow's done nothing
but stare at you since we arrived.

654
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:36,967
Excuse me.

655
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:47,352
He's one of them rangers. They're
dangerous folk, wandering the wilds.

656
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:52,107
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but around here he's known as strider.

657
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:55,735
Strider.

658
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:11,960
Voice of the ring: Baggins.

659
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:16,965
Baggins.

660
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:27,475
Baggins. Baggins.

661
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:31,605
Pippin:
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.

662
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:35,317
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

663
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,528
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

664
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:40,947
And my third cousin, twice removed...

665
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:47,204
- Pippin!
- Steady on, Frodo.

666
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:19,194
Sau Ron: You cannot hide.

667
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:25,325
I see you.

668
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:29,746
There is no life...

669
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:32,123
In the void.

670
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:33,750
Only...

671
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:47,055
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

672
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:52,852
What do you want?

673
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:55,336
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

674
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:58,400
- I carry nothing.
- Indeed.

675
01:02:58,692 --> 01:03:01,278
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

676
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:05,115
But to disappear entirely,
that is a rare gift.

677
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:08,243
- Who are you?
- Are you frightened?

678
01:03:10,662 --> 01:03:14,624
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

679
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:21,172
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, longshanks.

680
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:27,012
You have a stout heart, little hobbit.
But that will not save you.

681
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:30,098
You can no longer wait
for the wizard, Frodo.

682
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,224
They're coming.

683
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:56,434
What are they?

684
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:00,730
They were once men.

685
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:03,525
Great kings of men.

686
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:06,820
Then Sauron the deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

687
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:10,490
Blinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

688
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:14,119
One by one, falling into darkness.

689
01:05:14,202 --> 01:05:16,746
Now they are slaves to his will.

690
01:05:19,124 --> 01:05:20,875
They are the nazgul.

691
01:05:20,959 --> 01:05:23,753
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

692
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:26,005
At all times they feel...

693
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:28,133
The presence of the ring...

694
01:05:28,216 --> 01:05:32,804
Drawn to the power of the one.
They will never stop hunting you.

695
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:45,692
- Frodo: Where are you taking us?
- Into the wild.

696
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:58,037
How do we know this strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

697
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:00,999
I think a servant of the enemy
would look fairer...

698
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:05,295
- And feel fouler.
- He's foul enough.

699
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:08,756
We have no choice but to trust him.

700
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:12,343
- But where is he leading us?
- Strider: To rivendell, master gamgee.

701
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:18,016
- To the house of elrond.
- Sam: Did you hear that? Rivendell.

702
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:21,352
We're going to see the elves.

703
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:47,295
- Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
- What about breakfast?

704
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:50,131
- You've already had it.
- We've had one, yes.

705
01:06:50,215 --> 01:06:52,509
What about second breakfast?

706
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:59,140
Don't think he knows
about second breakfast, pip.

707
01:06:59,224 --> 01:07:04,604
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

708
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:08,900
- He knows about them, doesn't he?
- I wouldn't count on it.

709
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:15,949
Merry: Pippin!

710
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:35,969
What do they eat
when they can't get hobbit?

711
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:16,843
Who is she?

712
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:20,138
This woman you sing of.

713
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:26,019
'Tis the lady of li'ithien.

714
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:31,316
The elf-maiden who gave her love
to beren, a mortal.

715
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,278
What happened to her?

716
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:39,991
She died.

717
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:46,372
Get some sleep, Frodo.

718
01:08:56,633 --> 01:09:00,762
Saru man: The power of isengard
is at your command...

719
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:05,350
Sauron, lord of the earth.

720
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:14,484
Sau Ron:
Build me an army worthy of mordor.

721
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:24,661
What orders from mordor, my lord?
What does the eye command?

722
01:09:25,078 --> 01:09:27,038
We have work to do.

723
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:14,252
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.

724
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,462
Rip them all down.

725
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:46,784
This was the great watchtower
of amon scil.

726
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:51,164
We shall rest here tonight.

727
01:11:02,884 --> 01:11:06,387
These are for you.
Keep them close.

728
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:09,015
I'm going to have a look around.

729
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:13,311
Stay here.

730
01:11:15,855 --> 01:11:18,024
Merry: My tomato's burst.

731
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,234
Pippin: Could I have some bacon?

732
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:22,320
Merry: Want a tomato, Sam?

733
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:26,407
- What are you doing?!
- Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.

734
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:29,368
Sam: We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
Frodo: Put it out, you fools!

735
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:33,498
Put it out!
Pippin: That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

736
01:12:37,103 --> 01:12:38,563
Back, you devils!

737
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,195
- Frodo.
- Oh, Sam.

738
01:14:46,232 --> 01:14:47,233
Strider!

739
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:55,533
- Help him, strider.
- He's been stabbed by a morgul blade.

740
01:14:57,034 --> 01:15:01,914
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs elvish medicine.

741
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:07,628
Hurry!

742
01:15:07,712 --> 01:15:11,799
We're six days from rivendell!
He'll never make it!

743
01:15:11,882 --> 01:15:13,759
Hold on, Frodo.

744
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:57,381
Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.

745
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:02,386
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

746
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:07,183
Is he going to die?

747
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:12,188
He's passing into the shadow world.
He'll soon become a wraith like them.

748
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:21,238
- They're close.
- Sam, do you know the athelas plant?

749
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:22,907
- Athelas?
- Kingsfoil.

750
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:24,200
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.

751
01:18:24,283 --> 01:18:27,453
It may help to slow the poisoning.
Hurry!

752
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:45,971
Female: What's this?
A ranger caught off his guard?

753
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:11,914
Frodo.

754
01:19:28,847 --> 01:19:30,683
Who is she?

755
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:33,102
Frodo.

756
01:19:33,352 --> 01:19:36,855
- She's an elf.
- He's fading.

757
01:19:39,108 --> 01:19:41,360
He's not going to last.

758
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:44,154
We must get him to my father.

759
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:47,825
- I've been looking for you for two days.
- Where are you taking him?

760
01:19:47,908 --> 01:19:54,039
There are five wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.

761
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,215
What are they saying?

762
01:20:09,221 --> 01:20:10,889
I do not fear them.

763
01:20:20,733 --> 01:20:22,192
Arwen...

764
01:20:30,576 --> 01:20:34,955
What are you doing?!
Those wraiths are still out there!

765
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:32,281
Give up the halfling, she-elf.

766
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:35,784
If you want him, come and claim him.

767
01:23:35,427 --> 01:23:37,804
Frodo, no.

768
01:23:37,888 --> 01:23:40,307
Frodo, don't give in.

769
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:42,434
Not now.

770
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:55,864
Arwen: What grace is given me...

771
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:58,367
Let it pass to him.

772
01:23:58,617 --> 01:24:00,744
Let him be spared.

773
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:03,413
Save him.

774
01:24:15,801 --> 01:24:20,973
- Where am I?
- Gandalf: You are in the house of elrond.

775
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:27,938
And it is 10:00 in the morning
on October 24th, if you want to know.

776
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:33,694
- Gandalf!
- Yes, I'm here.

777
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:38,407
And you're lucky to be here too.

778
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:43,161
A few more hours and you
would have been beyond our aid.

779
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:47,416
But you have some strength in you,
my dear hobbit.

780
01:24:55,007 --> 01:24:57,509
What happened, Gandalf?

781
01:24:58,468 --> 01:25:03,849
- Why didn't you meet us?
- I am sorry, Frodo.

782
01:25:08,604 --> 01:25:10,355
I was delayed.

783
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:15,444
A friendship with saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

784
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:24,202
One ill turn deserves another.
It is over.

785
01:25:24,494 --> 01:25:27,247
Embrace the power of the ring...

786
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:30,334
Or embrace your own destruction!

787
01:25:32,628 --> 01:25:36,506
Gandalf:
There is only one lord of the ring.

788
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:40,761
Only one who can bend it to his will.

789
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:45,515
And he does not share power.

790
01:25:59,863 --> 01:26:03,241
So you have chosen death.

791
01:26:13,293 --> 01:26:17,089
Gandalf? What is it?

792
01:26:18,048 --> 01:26:19,841
Nothing, Frodo.

793
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:22,427
Sam: Frodo!

794
01:26:23,762 --> 01:26:26,264
- Sam.
- Bless you, you're awake!

795
01:26:26,348 --> 01:26:29,101
Sam has hardly left your side.

796
01:26:29,351 --> 01:26:31,551
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

797
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:37,025
By the skills of lord elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

798
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:42,114
Welcome to rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

799
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:33,540
- Frodo: Bilbo!
- Hello, Frodo, my lad.

800
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:42,132
Frodo: "There and back again:

801
01:27:42,382 --> 01:27:45,135
A hobbit's tale, by bilbo Baggins."

802
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:51,767
- This is wonderful.
- I meant to go back...

803
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:55,896
Wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

804
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:58,648
Visit lake-town...

805
01:27:58,899 --> 01:28:02,277
See the lonely mountain again.

806
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:07,616
But age, it seems,
has finally caught up with me.

807
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:21,505
Frodo: I miss the shire.

808
01:28:21,922 --> 01:28:27,052
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

809
01:28:27,385 --> 01:28:30,972
Off with you,
on one of your adventures.

810
01:28:33,934 --> 01:28:37,521
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

811
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:45,946
I'm not like you, bilbo.

812
01:28:47,072 --> 01:28:49,407
My dear boy.

813
01:28:53,495 --> 01:28:57,457
- Sam: Now, what have I forgotten?
- Packed already?

814
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:00,126
No harm in being prepared.

815
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:02,879
- I thought you wanted to see the elves.
- I do.

816
01:29:02,963 --> 01:29:05,966
- More than anything.
- I did.

817
01:29:06,049 --> 01:29:08,009
It's just...

818
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,471
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

819
01:29:11,555 --> 01:29:15,350
We got the ring this far,
to rivendell. And I thought...

820
01:29:15,433 --> 01:29:18,854
Seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

821
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:26,862
You are right, Sam.

822
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:31,783
We did what we set out to do.

823
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:34,953
The ring will be safe in rivendell.

824
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:41,376
I am ready to go home.

825
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:44,254
Elrond: His strength returns.

826
01:29:44,337 --> 01:29:50,093
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

827
01:29:50,635 --> 01:29:53,263
And yet to have come so far
still bearing the ring...

828
01:29:53,346 --> 01:29:57,183
The hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

829
01:29:57,267 --> 01:30:00,645
It is a burden he should never
have had to bear.

830
01:30:00,896 --> 01:30:06,401
- We can ask no more of Frodo.
- Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

831
01:30:06,484 --> 01:30:11,156
Sauron's forces are massing in the east.
His eye is fixed on rivendell.

832
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:14,200
And saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

833
01:30:14,284 --> 01:30:17,579
Our list of allies grows thin.

834
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:21,207
His treachery runs deeper
than you know.

835
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:25,045
By foul craft, saruman
has crossed orcs with goblin-men.

836
01:30:25,128 --> 01:30:27,631
He's breeding an army
in the caverns of lsengard.

837
01:30:27,923 --> 01:30:32,552
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

838
01:30:32,636 --> 01:30:35,096
Saruman is coming for the ring.

839
01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:39,684
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the elves.

840
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:44,189
We do not have the strength
to fight both mordor and lsengard!

841
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:53,031
The ring cannot stay here.

842
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:15,720
Elrond: This peril belongs
to all middle-earth.

843
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:18,682
They must decide now how to end it.

844
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:23,311
The time of the elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

845
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:27,607
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The dwarves?

846
01:31:27,691 --> 01:31:32,862
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

847
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:37,325
It is in men
that we must place our hope.

848
01:31:37,659 --> 01:31:39,369
Men?

849
01:31:40,245 --> 01:31:43,540
Men are weak.
The race of men is failing.

850
01:31:43,623 --> 01:31:48,128
The blood of numenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

851
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:52,007
It is because of men
the ring survives.

852
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:53,758
I was there, Gandalf.

853
01:31:54,426 --> 01:31:57,262
I was there 3000 years ago...

854
01:32:04,102 --> 01:32:06,563
When isildur took the ring.

855
01:32:06,646 --> 01:32:10,608
I was there the day
the strength of men failed.

856
01:32:13,153 --> 01:32:15,697
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

857
01:32:17,282 --> 01:32:20,910
Elrond: I led isildur into the heart
of mount doom...

858
01:32:21,161 --> 01:32:24,748
Where the ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.

859
01:32:24,831 --> 01:32:27,459
Cast it into the fire!

860
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:36,426
- Destroy it!
- No.

861
01:32:37,761 --> 01:32:39,929
Isildur!

862
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:45,143
Elrond: It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.

863
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:53,485
Isildur kept the ring.
The line of kings is broken.

864
01:32:54,402 --> 01:32:58,114
There's no strength left
in the world of men.

865
01:32:58,198 --> 01:33:03,161
- They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
- There is one who could unite them.

866
01:33:03,244 --> 01:33:06,664
One who could reclaim
the throne of gondor.

867
01:33:08,333 --> 01:33:12,212
He turned from that path
a long time ago.

868
01:33:12,295 --> 01:33:14,464
He has chosen exile.

869
01:33:45,703 --> 01:33:47,747
You are no elf.

870
01:33:47,831 --> 01:33:49,958
Men of the south are welcome here.

871
01:33:50,542 --> 01:33:54,045
- Who are you?
- I am a friend to Gandalf the grey.

872
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:58,383
Then we are here on common purpose...

873
01:33:58,758 --> 01:34:00,218
Friend.

874
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:18,319
The shards of narsil.

875
01:34:21,781 --> 01:34:26,244
The blade that cut the ring
from Sauron's hand.

876
01:34:29,164 --> 01:34:31,416
It's still sharp.

877
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:43,386
But no more than a broken heirloom.

878
01:35:10,205 --> 01:35:13,249
Why do you fear the past?

879
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:19,464
You are isildur's heir,
not isildur himself.

880
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:23,134
You are not bound to his fate.

881
01:35:23,635 --> 01:35:27,639
The same blood flows in my veins.

882
01:35:30,642 --> 01:35:33,228
The same weakness.

883
01:35:35,939 --> 01:35:38,816
Your time will come.

884
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:43,321
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

885
01:36:33,871 --> 01:36:36,541
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

886
01:36:38,543 --> 01:36:43,548
Forsaking the immortal life
of your people.

887
01:36:44,674 --> 01:36:46,592
And to that I hold.

888
01:36:46,676 --> 01:36:50,346
I would rather share
one lifetime with you...

889
01:36:50,596 --> 01:36:54,475
Than face all the ages
of this world alone.

890
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:06,696
I choose a mortal life.

891
01:37:08,031 --> 01:37:12,285
- You cannot give me this.
- It is mine to give to whom I will...

892
01:37:15,538 --> 01:37:18,041
Like my heart.

893
01:37:33,806 --> 01:37:37,602
Elrond: Strangers from distant lands,
friends of old...

894
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:41,647
You've been summoned here
to answer the threat of mordor.

895
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:47,153
Middle-earth stands upon the brink
of destruction. None can escape it.

896
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:50,990
You will unite, or you will fall.

897
01:37:51,074 --> 01:37:55,411
Each race is bound to this fate,
this one doom.

898
01:37:57,246 --> 01:38:00,750
Bring forth the ring, Frodo.

899
01:38:14,806 --> 01:38:16,557
So it is true.

900
01:38:33,991 --> 01:38:36,119
In a dream...

901
01:38:37,703 --> 01:38:40,832
I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

902
01:38:41,124 --> 01:38:42,834
But in the west
a pale light lingered.

903
01:38:43,626 --> 01:38:45,378
A voice was crying:

904
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:48,589
"Your doom is near at hand.

905
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:52,343
Isildur's bane is found."

906
01:38:56,347 --> 01:38:58,182
Isildur's bane.

907
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:00,226
Boromir!

908
01:39:23,332 --> 01:39:27,211
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in imladris.

909
01:39:27,295 --> 01:39:31,090
I do not ask your pardon,
master elrond...

910
01:39:31,174 --> 01:39:33,342
For the black speech of mordor...

911
01:39:33,634 --> 01:39:35,052
May yet be heard...

912
01:39:35,136 --> 01:39:38,222
In every corner of the west!

913
01:39:38,306 --> 01:39:41,017
The ring is altogether evil.

914
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:42,852
It is a gift.

915
01:39:43,436 --> 01:39:45,521
A gift to the foes of mordor.

916
01:39:46,147 --> 01:39:48,316
Why not use this ring?

917
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:51,277
Long has my father,
the steward of gondor...

918
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:55,740
Kept the forces of mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

919
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:58,242
Are your lands kept safe.

920
01:40:00,036 --> 01:40:04,373
Give gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

921
01:40:04,665 --> 01:40:08,419
You cannot wield it.
None of us can.

922
01:40:09,045 --> 01:40:13,132
The one ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

923
01:40:13,216 --> 01:40:16,802
And what would a ranger know
of this matter?

924
01:40:17,094 --> 01:40:19,096
This is no mere ranger.

925
01:40:20,097 --> 01:40:23,768
He is aragorn, son of arathorn.

926
01:40:24,268 --> 01:40:27,188
You owe him your allegiance.

927
01:40:31,275 --> 01:40:33,194
Aragorn.

928
01:40:34,946 --> 01:40:37,782
This is isildur's heir?

929
01:40:40,117 --> 01:40:42,828
And heir to the throne of gondor.

930
01:40:49,794 --> 01:40:52,630
Gondor has no king.

931
01:40:54,465 --> 01:40:56,133
Gondor needs no king.

932
01:41:02,807 --> 01:41:06,477
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

933
01:41:07,478 --> 01:41:10,982
You have only one choice.

934
01:41:11,232 --> 01:41:13,609
The ring must be destroyed.

935
01:41:18,823 --> 01:41:21,367
What are we waiting for?

936
01:41:33,504 --> 01:41:36,507
The ring cannot be destroyed, gimli,
son of gléin...

937
01:41:36,757 --> 01:41:41,012
By any craft that we here possess.

938
01:41:41,512 --> 01:41:45,725
The ring was made in the fires
of mount doom.

939
01:41:45,808 --> 01:41:49,687
Only there can it be unmade.

940
01:41:50,730 --> 01:41:53,399
It must be taken deep into mordor...

941
01:41:53,482 --> 01:41:57,361
And cast back into the fiery chasm
from whence it came.

942
01:42:00,531 --> 01:42:02,533
One of you...

943
01:42:03,034 --> 01:42:05,202
Must do this.

944
01:42:08,122 --> 01:42:11,834
One does not simply walk into mordor.

945
01:42:12,710 --> 01:42:16,380
Its black gates are guarded
by more than just orcs.

946
01:42:17,214 --> 01:42:21,427
There is evil there
that does not sleep.

947
01:42:21,510 --> 01:42:25,765
The great eye is ever-watchful.

948
01:42:26,557 --> 01:42:28,643
It is a barren wasteland...

949
01:42:28,726 --> 01:42:32,438
Riddled with fire, and ash
and dust.

950
01:42:32,521 --> 01:42:36,400
The very air you breathe
is a poisonous fume.

951
01:42:36,651 --> 01:42:40,905
Not with 10,000 men
could you do this. It is folly.

952
01:42:41,155 --> 01:42:45,660
Have you heard nothing lord elrond
has said? The ring must be destroyed.

953
01:42:45,743 --> 01:42:48,454
And I suppose you think
you are the one to do it!

954
01:42:48,537 --> 01:42:53,292
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

955
01:42:53,376 --> 01:42:58,798
I will be dead before I see the ring
in the hands of an elf!

956
01:43:00,716 --> 01:43:03,260
Never trust an elf!

957
01:43:04,428 --> 01:43:10,267
Gandalf: Do you not understand?
While you bicker, Sauron's power grows!

958
01:43:10,601 --> 01:43:13,437
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

959
01:43:32,248 --> 01:43:34,458
I will take it.

960
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:38,963
I will take it.

961
01:43:44,802 --> 01:43:47,847
I will take the ring to mordor.

962
01:43:55,896 --> 01:43:57,148
Though...

963
01:44:00,234 --> 01:44:02,069
I do not know the way.

964
01:44:04,071 --> 01:44:08,451
I will help you bear
this burden, Frodo Baggins...

965
01:44:08,534 --> 01:44:11,954
As long as it is yours to bear.

966
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:16,167
If by my life
or death I can protect you...

967
01:44:16,917 --> 01:44:18,252
I will.

968
01:44:21,464 --> 01:44:23,758
You have my sword.

969
01:44:25,593 --> 01:44:27,678
And you have my bow.

970
01:44:28,262 --> 01:44:30,765
And my ax.

971
01:44:37,772 --> 01:44:40,775
You carry the fates
of us all, little one.

972
01:44:42,777 --> 01:44:46,447
If this is indeed
the will of the council...

973
01:44:46,906 --> 01:44:49,325
- Then gondor will see it done.
- Hey!

974
01:44:51,952 --> 01:44:56,791
- Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
- It is hardly possible to separate you...

975
01:44:56,874 --> 01:45:01,796
Even when he is summoned
to a secret council and you are not.

976
01:45:02,296 --> 01:45:04,256
We're coming too!

977
01:45:06,383 --> 01:45:09,136
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

978
01:45:09,386 --> 01:45:12,723
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

979
01:45:13,057 --> 01:45:14,433
Mission.

980
01:45:14,517 --> 01:45:16,060
Quest.

981
01:45:16,519 --> 01:45:17,561
Thing.

982
01:45:19,396 --> 01:45:22,066
Well, that rules you out, pip.

983
01:45:23,651 --> 01:45:25,569
Nine companions.

984
01:45:27,404 --> 01:45:29,240
So be it.

985
01:45:29,573 --> 01:45:32,576
You shall be
the fellowship of the ring.

986
01:45:33,244 --> 01:45:35,162
Great!

987
01:45:35,246 --> 01:45:37,581
Where are we going?

988
01:46:19,970 --> 01:46:22,514
Elrond:

989
01:46:24,433 --> 01:46:28,228
Elrond:

990
01:46:30,648 --> 01:46:34,151
In her heart, your mother
knew you'd be hunted all your life.

991
01:46:34,652 --> 01:46:36,320
That you'd never escape your fate.

992
01:46:36,820 --> 01:46:40,491
The skill of the elves
can reforge the sword of kings...

993
01:46:40,908 --> 01:46:44,828
But only you have the power
to wield it.

994
01:46:45,829 --> 01:46:48,332
I do not want that power.

995
01:46:48,499 --> 01:46:51,168
I have never wanted it.

996
01:46:52,503 --> 01:46:55,130
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

997
01:46:59,510 --> 01:47:01,845
Bilbo: My old sword! Sting.

998
01:47:02,054 --> 01:47:03,180
Here, take it. Take it.

999
01:47:08,686 --> 01:47:12,648
- It's so light.
- Yes. Made by the elves, you know.

1000
01:47:13,357 --> 01:47:17,444
The blade glows blue
when orcs are close.

1001
01:47:17,653 --> 01:47:22,199
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

1002
01:47:22,408 --> 01:47:24,868
Here's a pretty thing.

1003
01:47:27,371 --> 01:47:31,750
As light as a feather,
and as hard as dragon scales.

1004
01:47:31,959 --> 01:47:35,212
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

1005
01:47:38,757 --> 01:47:40,217
Oh!

1006
01:47:43,262 --> 01:47:45,305
My old ring.

1007
01:47:46,557 --> 01:47:50,477
I should very much like...

1008
01:47:50,728 --> 01:47:54,732
To hold it again, one last time.

1009
01:48:12,082 --> 01:48:15,753
I'm sorry I brought this upon you,
my boy.

1010
01:48:16,086 --> 01:48:20,215
I'm sorry that you
must carry this burden.

1011
01:48:24,720 --> 01:48:27,765
I'm sorry for everything.

1012
01:48:42,780 --> 01:48:46,992
The ring-bearer is setting out
on the quest of mount doom.

1013
01:48:48,327 --> 01:48:50,954
On you who travel with him,
no oath...

1014
01:48:51,163 --> 01:48:54,291
Nor bond is laid to go further
than you will.

1015
01:48:57,753 --> 01:49:00,297
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

1016
01:49:00,756 --> 01:49:04,676
May the blessings of elves and men...

1017
01:49:05,219 --> 01:49:07,805
And all free folk go with you.

1018
01:49:10,891 --> 01:49:14,978
The fellowship awaits the ring-bearer.

1019
01:49:33,413 --> 01:49:35,916
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

1020
01:49:36,458 --> 01:49:38,293
Left.

1021
01:50:57,789 --> 01:51:02,211
Gandalf: We must hold to this course,
west of the misty mountains, for 40 days.

1022
01:51:02,419 --> 01:51:06,173
If our luck holds, the gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.

1023
01:51:06,381 --> 01:51:09,927
From there, our road
turns east to mordor.

1024
01:51:10,093 --> 01:51:13,931
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

1025
01:51:15,766 --> 01:51:16,808
Move your feet.

1026
01:51:17,017 --> 01:51:18,536
- Merry: You look good, pippin.
- Thanks.

1027
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:19,937
Boromir: Faster!

1028
01:51:21,313 --> 01:51:25,108
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

1029
01:51:25,317 --> 01:51:28,070
I'd say we were taking
the long way 'round.

1030
01:51:28,570 --> 01:51:31,615
Gandalf, we could pass through
the mines of Moria.

1031
01:51:32,282 --> 01:51:36,119
My cousin balin would give us
a royal welcome.

1032
01:51:36,453 --> 01:51:41,833
No, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

1033
01:51:51,051 --> 01:51:52,135
Sorry!

1034
01:51:52,970 --> 01:51:54,471
Merry: Get him!

1035
01:51:55,806 --> 01:51:58,267
Merry: For the shire!
Pippin: Hold him. Hold him down, merry!

1036
01:51:58,809 --> 01:52:01,144
Gentlemen, that's enough.

1037
01:52:04,940 --> 01:52:06,660
Merry: You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

1038
01:52:06,984 --> 01:52:09,653
- What is that?
- Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

1039
01:52:09,903 --> 01:52:12,614
It's moving fast.

1040
01:52:12,823 --> 01:52:14,992
Against the wind.

1041
01:52:15,784 --> 01:52:17,911
- Crebain from dunland!
- Hide!

1042
01:52:18,120 --> 01:52:20,831
- Hurry!
- Take cover!

1043
01:52:54,239 --> 01:52:55,991
Spies of saruman.

1044
01:52:56,742 --> 01:53:00,037
The passage south is being watched.

1045
01:53:01,204 --> 01:53:04,541
We must take the pass of caradhras.

1046
01:53:17,179 --> 01:53:18,889
Aragorn: Frodo!

1047
01:53:37,866 --> 01:53:40,118
Boromir.

1048
01:53:40,369 --> 01:53:44,581
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

1049
01:53:44,790 --> 01:53:47,918
Over so small a thing.

1050
01:53:51,129 --> 01:53:53,090
Such a little thing.

1051
01:53:53,298 --> 01:53:54,758
Boromir!

1052
01:53:55,384 --> 01:53:58,095
Give the ring to Frodo.

1053
01:54:07,896 --> 01:54:09,940
As you wish.

1054
01:54:10,649 --> 01:54:12,651
I care not.

1055
01:54:48,061 --> 01:54:52,774
So, Gandalf, you try
to lead them over caradhras.

1056
01:54:52,983 --> 01:54:57,571
And if that fails,
where then will you go?

1057
01:54:58,864 --> 01:55:01,825
If the mountain defeats you...

1058
01:55:02,075 --> 01:55:06,496
Will you risk
a more dangerous road?

1059
01:55:18,842 --> 01:55:21,720
There is a fell voice on the air.

1060
01:55:22,846 --> 01:55:24,347
It's saruman!

1061
01:55:33,231 --> 01:55:37,903
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

1062
01:56:46,429 --> 01:56:48,265
We must get off the mountain!

1063
01:56:48,765 --> 01:56:53,103
Make for the gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

1064
01:56:53,270 --> 01:56:56,606
The gap of Rohan takes us
too close to lsengard!

1065
01:56:56,773 --> 01:57:00,527
Gimli: We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

1066
01:57:00,777 --> 01:57:03,613
Let us go through the mines of Moria.

1067
01:57:05,448 --> 01:57:09,286
Saru man: Moria. You fear to go
into those mines.

1068
01:57:09,953 --> 01:57:14,958
The dwarves delved too greedily
and too deep.

1069
01:57:15,792 --> 01:57:20,672
You know what they awoke
in the darkness of khazad—dum:

1070
01:57:21,965 --> 01:57:25,468
Shadow and flame.

1071
01:57:28,805 --> 01:57:31,474
Let the ring-bearer decide.

1072
01:57:36,187 --> 01:57:38,315
We cannot stay here!

1073
01:57:38,481 --> 01:57:41,318
This will be the death of the hobbits.

1074
01:57:41,484 --> 01:57:43,194
Frodo?

1075
01:57:46,197 --> 01:57:49,075
We will go through the mines.

1076
01:57:49,826 --> 01:57:51,703
So be it.

1077
01:57:58,335 --> 01:58:02,297
Frodo, come and help an old man.

1078
01:58:05,842 --> 01:58:08,011
How is your shoulder?

1079
01:58:08,219 --> 01:58:11,514
- Better than it was.
- And the ring?

1080
01:58:13,016 --> 01:58:15,518
You feel its power growing, don't you?

1081
01:58:16,019 --> 01:58:18,938
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

1082
01:58:19,356 --> 01:58:23,276
Evil will be drawn to you
from outside the fellowship.

1083
01:58:23,443 --> 01:58:26,029
And, I fear, from within.

1084
01:58:28,698 --> 01:58:32,869
- Who then do I trust?
- You must trust yourself.

1085
01:58:33,036 --> 01:58:35,872
Trust your own strengths.

1086
01:58:36,039 --> 01:58:38,625
- What do you mean?
- There are many powers in this world...

1087
01:58:38,833 --> 01:58:40,877
For good or for evil.

1088
01:58:41,044 --> 01:58:43,380
Some are greater than I am.

1089
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:47,550
And against some I have not yet
been tested.

1090
01:58:48,885 --> 01:58:50,261
The walls...

1091
01:58:50,970 --> 01:58:53,056
Of Moria.

1092
01:58:58,770 --> 01:59:01,773
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

1093
01:59:01,981 --> 01:59:06,403
Gandalf: Their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

1094
01:59:06,778 --> 01:59:09,280
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1095
01:59:17,288 --> 01:59:20,583
Well, let's see.

1096
01:59:22,794 --> 01:59:26,172
It mirrors only starlight
and moonlight.

1097
01:59:40,228 --> 01:59:44,315
It reads, "the doors of Durin,
lord of Moria.

1098
01:59:44,899 --> 01:59:49,529
- Speak, friend, and enter."
- What do you suppose that means?

1099
01:59:49,779 --> 01:59:54,534
It's simple. If you are a friend, you speak
the password and the doors will open.

1100
02:00:18,308 --> 02:00:19,434
Nothing's happening.

1101
02:00:26,441 --> 02:00:30,653
I once knew every spell
in all the tongues of elves...

1102
02:00:30,987 --> 02:00:33,823
Men and orcs.

1103
02:00:34,073 --> 02:00:35,325
What are you going to do, then?

1104
02:00:35,492 --> 02:00:37,744
Knock your head against these doors,
peregrin took!

1105
02:00:37,994 --> 02:00:39,996
And if that does not shatter them...

1106
02:00:40,163 --> 02:00:42,874
And I am allowed a little peace
from foolish questions...

1107
02:00:43,041 --> 02:00:46,503
I will try to find the opening words.

1108
02:00:59,349 --> 02:01:01,893
Mines are no place for a pony.

1109
02:01:02,101 --> 02:01:06,189
- Even one so brave as bill.
- Bye-bye, bill.

1110
02:01:07,357 --> 02:01:10,193
Go on, bill. Go on.

1111
02:01:10,693 --> 02:01:14,239
Don't worry, Sam,
he knows the way home.

1112
02:01:21,037 --> 02:01:23,623
Do not disturb the water.

1113
02:01:23,873 --> 02:01:25,708
Oh, it's useless.

1114
02:01:43,309 --> 02:01:46,437
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

1115
02:01:46,813 --> 02:01:49,732
What's the elvish word for "friend"?

1116
02:02:10,587 --> 02:02:15,425
Gimli: Soon, master elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the dwarves.

1117
02:02:15,925 --> 02:02:21,598
Roaring fires, malt beer,
ripe meat off the bone!

1118
02:02:23,099 --> 02:02:26,185
This, my friend,
is the home of my cousin balin.

1119
02:02:26,561 --> 02:02:28,938
And they call it a mine.

1120
02:02:29,147 --> 02:02:31,107
A mine!

1121
02:02:32,150 --> 02:02:35,486
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

1122
02:02:39,782 --> 02:02:41,200
Gimli:

1123
02:02:48,791 --> 02:02:50,293
Goblins.

1124
02:02:54,213 --> 02:02:58,509
We make for the gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

1125
02:02:59,594 --> 02:03:02,138
Aragorn:
Now, get out of here. Get out!

1126
02:03:04,974 --> 02:03:07,310
Merry: Frodo! Frodo: Help!

1127
02:03:07,518 --> 02:03:09,145
Strider!

1128
02:03:09,312 --> 02:03:12,148
Frodo: Help! Sam: Get off him!

1129
02:03:12,315 --> 02:03:13,316
Aragorn!

1130
02:03:25,995 --> 02:03:27,538
Strider!

1131
02:03:51,145 --> 02:03:52,188
Into the mines!

1132
02:03:52,355 --> 02:03:55,566
- Legolas!
- Aragorn: Into the cave!

1133
02:04:18,548 --> 02:04:22,093
Gandalf:
We now have but one choice.

1134
02:04:22,301 --> 02:04:27,223
We must face the long dark of Moria.

1135
02:04:27,432 --> 02:04:29,392
Be on your guard.

1136
02:04:29,600 --> 02:04:33,062
There are older
and fouler things than orcs...

1137
02:04:33,229 --> 02:04:36,774
In the deep places of the world.

1138
02:04:44,741 --> 02:04:48,703
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey
to the other side.

1139
02:04:48,911 --> 02:04:52,749
Let us hope that our presence
may go unnoticed.

1140
02:05:38,503 --> 02:05:42,215
The wealth of Moria is not in gold...

1141
02:05:42,381 --> 02:05:44,801
Orjewels...

1142
02:05:44,967 --> 02:05:48,012
But mithril.

1143
02:06:06,364 --> 02:06:11,285
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

1144
02:06:11,494 --> 02:06:15,498
- Oh, that was a kingly gift.
- Yes.

1145
02:06:15,665 --> 02:06:17,542
I never told him...

1146
02:06:17,708 --> 02:06:22,672
But its worth was greater than
the value of the shire.

1147
02:06:35,017 --> 02:06:36,727
Pippin.

1148
02:06:57,415 --> 02:07:00,042
I have no memory of this place.

1149
02:07:02,128 --> 02:07:03,629
Pippin: Are we lost? Merry: No.

1150
02:07:03,838 --> 02:07:06,340
Pippin: I think we are.
Merry: Gandalf's thinking.

1151
02:07:06,549 --> 02:07:07,967
Pippin: Merry? Merry: What?

1152
02:07:08,259 --> 02:07:10,219
Pippin: I'm hungry.

1153
02:07:21,522 --> 02:07:25,985
- There's something down there.
- It's gollum.

1154
02:07:26,194 --> 02:07:30,323
- Gollum?
- He's been following us for three days.

1155
02:07:30,531 --> 02:07:34,702
- He escaped the dungeons of barad-dur?
- Escaped...

1156
02:07:35,369 --> 02:07:37,038
Or was set loose.

1157
02:07:37,538 --> 02:07:41,209
Now the ring has brought him here.

1158
02:07:43,836 --> 02:07:46,589
He will never be rid of his need for it.

1159
02:07:46,756 --> 02:07:52,511
He hates and loves the ring,
as he hates and loves himself.

1160
02:07:52,678 --> 02:07:57,558
Sméagol's life is a sad story.

1161
02:07:57,725 --> 02:08:03,689
Yes, sméagol he was once called.
Before the ring found him.

1162
02:08:04,607 --> 02:08:07,401
Before it drove him mad.

1163
02:08:07,693 --> 02:08:10,571
It's a pity bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

1164
02:08:10,738 --> 02:08:11,948
Pity?

1165
02:08:13,032 --> 02:08:15,910
It is pity that stayed bilbo's hand.

1166
02:08:16,827 --> 02:08:22,041
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

1167
02:08:23,459 --> 02:08:25,962
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1168
02:08:28,381 --> 02:08:32,343
Do not be too eager
to deal out death and judgment.

1169
02:08:32,551 --> 02:08:35,471
Even the very wise
cannot see all ends.

1170
02:08:36,055 --> 02:08:41,978
My heart tells me that gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

1171
02:08:42,770 --> 02:08:45,606
Before this is over.

1172
02:08:47,108 --> 02:08:50,987
The pity of bilbo
may rule the fate of many.

1173
02:08:57,618 --> 02:09:00,997
I wish the ring
had never come to me.

1174
02:09:02,415 --> 02:09:04,458
I wish none of this had happened.

1175
02:09:04,625 --> 02:09:09,672
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

1176
02:09:10,506 --> 02:09:16,012
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

1177
02:09:17,513 --> 02:09:21,517
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

1178
02:09:21,892 --> 02:09:24,312
Bilbo was meant to find the ring.

1179
02:09:24,812 --> 02:09:29,150
In which case,
you also were meant to have it.

1180
02:09:29,317 --> 02:09:32,528
And that is an encouraging thought.

1181
02:09:35,448 --> 02:09:36,615
Ah!

1182
02:09:37,408 --> 02:09:39,327
It's that way.

1183
02:09:39,535 --> 02:09:41,829
He's remembered. Gandalf: No.

1184
02:09:42,038 --> 02:09:45,833
But the air doesn't smell
so foul down here.

1185
02:09:46,042 --> 02:09:51,213
If in doubt, meriadoc,
always follow your nose.

1186
02:10:06,062 --> 02:10:10,191
Let me risk a little more light.

1187
02:10:17,365 --> 02:10:22,578
The great realm
and dwarf-city of dwarrowdelf.

1188
02:10:25,081 --> 02:10:28,501
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.

1189
02:10:53,401 --> 02:10:55,111
Gimli!

1190
02:11:06,747 --> 02:11:09,917
Oh, no.

1191
02:11:20,302 --> 02:11:22,304
Gandalf: "Here lies balin...

1192
02:11:22,763 --> 02:11:24,765
Son of fundin...

1193
02:11:25,099 --> 02:11:27,726
Lord of Moria."

1194
02:11:28,769 --> 02:11:30,438
He is dead, then.

1195
02:11:32,606 --> 02:11:33,816
It's as I feared.

1196
02:11:52,126 --> 02:11:55,045
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1197
02:11:55,254 --> 02:11:59,967
Gandalf: "They have taken the bridge
and the second hall.

1198
02:12:01,051 --> 02:12:03,637
We have barred the gates...

1199
02:12:04,305 --> 02:12:06,807
But cannot hold them for long.

1200
02:12:06,974 --> 02:12:09,810
The ground shakes.

1201
02:12:10,186 --> 02:12:11,812
Drums...

1202
02:12:12,188 --> 02:12:15,566
Drums in the deep.

1203
02:12:19,111 --> 02:12:21,155
We cannot get out.

1204
02:12:23,157 --> 02:12:26,994
A shadow moves in the dark.

1205
02:12:28,662 --> 02:12:31,207
We cannot get out.

1206
02:12:34,210 --> 02:12:36,170
They are coming."

1207
02:13:19,213 --> 02:13:21,048
Fool of a took!

1208
02:13:21,382 --> 02:13:25,219
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

1209
02:13:51,161 --> 02:13:52,788
Sam: Frodo!

1210
02:13:55,082 --> 02:13:56,584
Orcs.

1211
02:14:03,632 --> 02:14:05,634
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1212
02:14:12,891 --> 02:14:14,685
They have a cave-troll.

1213
02:14:30,492 --> 02:14:31,660
Let them come!

1214
02:14:32,161 --> 02:14:35,706
There is one dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

1215
02:16:54,595 --> 02:16:57,347
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1216
02:17:37,304 --> 02:17:39,139
Frodo: Aragorn! Aragorn!

1217
02:19:29,291 --> 02:19:30,626
Oh, no.

1218
02:19:39,009 --> 02:19:40,886
He's alive.

1219
02:19:43,305 --> 02:19:46,308
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1220
02:19:46,642 --> 02:19:48,810
You should be dead.

1221
02:19:49,019 --> 02:19:51,521
That spear would have skewered
a wild boar.

1222
02:19:51,772 --> 02:19:56,526
I think there's more to this hobbit
than meets the eye.

1223
02:20:06,244 --> 02:20:08,830
You are full of surprises,
master Baggins.

1224
02:20:14,836 --> 02:20:16,797
To the bridge of khazad-dum!

1225
02:20:31,770 --> 02:20:33,355
Aragorn: This way!

1226
02:21:43,759 --> 02:21:46,762
What is this new devilry?

1227
02:22:02,861 --> 02:22:05,655
A balrog.

1228
02:22:05,947 --> 02:22:09,117
A demon of the ancient world.

1229
02:22:11,286 --> 02:22:13,747
This foe is beyond any of you.

1230
02:22:23,799 --> 02:22:25,300
Quickly!

1231
02:22:43,819 --> 02:22:45,445
Lead them on, aragorn.

1232
02:22:46,822 --> 02:22:49,324
The bridge is near.

1233
02:22:51,409 --> 02:22:55,497
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

1234
02:23:44,671 --> 02:23:45,881
Boromir: Merry! Pippin!

1235
02:24:01,271 --> 02:24:04,524
Nobody tosses a dwarf.

1236
02:24:22,209 --> 02:24:24,085
Steady.

1237
02:24:48,944 --> 02:24:50,111
Hang on!

1238
02:25:00,914 --> 02:25:02,624
Lean forward!

1239
02:25:05,627 --> 02:25:06,628
Steady.

1240
02:25:07,963 --> 02:25:09,130
Come on!

1241
02:25:28,108 --> 02:25:29,901
Over the bridge!

1242
02:25:30,151 --> 02:25:31,653
Fly!

1243
02:26:16,364 --> 02:26:18,366
You cannot pass!

1244
02:26:24,414 --> 02:26:29,294
I am a servant of the secret fire,
wielder of the flame of anor.

1245
02:26:30,295 --> 02:26:34,049
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of udun!

1246
02:26:44,059 --> 02:26:46,061
Go back to the shadow.

1247
02:26:53,902 --> 02:26:58,323
You shall not pass!

1248
02:27:25,475 --> 02:27:29,354
- Boromir: No! No!
- Gandalf!

1249
02:27:37,028 --> 02:27:39,489
Fly, you fools!

1250
02:27:51,960 --> 02:27:54,129
Aragorn!

1251
02:28:51,352 --> 02:28:54,189
Legolas, get them up.

1252
02:28:58,318 --> 02:29:00,153
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

1253
02:29:00,320 --> 02:29:03,948
By nightfall, these hills will
be swarming with orcs.

1254
02:29:04,157 --> 02:29:07,494
We must reach the woods of lothlorien.

1255
02:29:08,369 --> 02:29:11,706
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

1256
02:29:13,208 --> 02:29:15,376
On your feet, Sam.

1257
02:29:15,710 --> 02:29:17,212
Frodo?

1258
02:30:13,518 --> 02:30:16,062
Stay close, young hobbits!

1259
02:30:16,771 --> 02:30:20,942
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.

1260
02:30:21,150 --> 02:30:23,695
An elf-witch...

1261
02:30:24,237 --> 02:30:27,115
Of terrible power.

1262
02:30:27,657 --> 02:30:29,867
All who look upon her...

1263
02:30:30,076 --> 02:30:31,869
Fall under her spell.

1264
02:30:32,078 --> 02:30:33,371
Female voice: Frodo!

1265
02:30:35,623 --> 02:30:37,667
And are never seen again.

1266
02:30:37,875 --> 02:30:42,380
Female voice: Your coming to us is
as the footsteps of doom.

1267
02:30:42,589 --> 02:30:46,301
You bring great evil here,
ring-bearer.

1268
02:30:46,467 --> 02:30:48,261
Sam: Mr. Frodo?

1269
02:30:53,558 --> 02:30:59,147
Well, here's one dwarf
she won't ensnare so easily.

1270
02:30:59,314 --> 02:31:03,901
I have the eyes of a hawk
and the ears of a fox.

1271
02:31:11,576 --> 02:31:16,164
The dwarf breathes so loud,
we could have shot him in the dark.

1272
02:31:34,307 --> 02:31:36,601
So much for the legendary courtesy
of the elves!

1273
02:31:36,768 --> 02:31:38,686
Speak words we can all understand!

1274
02:31:38,853 --> 02:31:43,441
We have not had dealings
with the dwarves since the dark days.

1275
02:31:43,691 --> 02:31:46,235
And you know what this dwarf
says to that?

1276
02:31:53,159 --> 02:31:55,119
That was not so courteous.

1277
02:32:01,668 --> 02:32:05,713
You bring great evil with you.

1278
02:32:07,465 --> 02:32:09,676
You can go no further.

1279
02:32:46,921 --> 02:32:49,590
Gandalf's death was not in vain.

1280
02:32:50,717 --> 02:32:52,593
Nor would he have you give up hope.

1281
02:32:54,095 --> 02:32:57,432
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

1282
02:32:58,307 --> 02:33:01,436
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

1283
02:33:04,397 --> 02:33:06,441
You will follow me.

1284
02:33:18,119 --> 02:33:20,121
Caras galadhon.

1285
02:33:20,747 --> 02:33:23,708
The heart of elvendom on earth.

1286
02:33:23,875 --> 02:33:29,547
Realm of the lord celeborn
and of Galadriel, lady of light.

1287
02:34:48,543 --> 02:34:51,671
The enemy knows you have entered here.

1288
02:34:52,338 --> 02:34:57,510
What hope you had in secrecy
is now gone.

1289
02:34:59,220 --> 02:35:03,683
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from rivendell.

1290
02:35:03,933 --> 02:35:05,726
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

1291
02:35:05,935 --> 02:35:09,063
For I much desire to speak with him.

1292
02:35:09,230 --> 02:35:12,024
I can no longer see him from afar.

1293
02:35:12,900 --> 02:35:18,072
Galadriel: Gandalf the grey did not
pass the borders of this land.

1294
02:35:18,322 --> 02:35:20,741
He has fallen into shadow.

1295
02:35:25,454 --> 02:35:29,959
He was taken by both shadow and flame.

1296
02:35:31,586 --> 02:35:35,339
A balrog of morgoth.

1297
02:35:36,048 --> 02:35:39,427
For we went needlessly
into the net of Moria.

1298
02:35:41,554 --> 02:35:44,765
Needless were none of the deeds
of Gandalf in life.

1299
02:35:45,433 --> 02:35:48,728
We do not yet know his full purpose.

1300
02:35:53,482 --> 02:35:57,778
Do not let the great emptiness
of khazad-dum fill your heart...

1301
02:35:58,070 --> 02:36:00,406
Gimli, son of gléin.

1302
02:36:01,407 --> 02:36:04,952
For the world has grown
full of peril...

1303
02:36:06,412 --> 02:36:09,081
And in all lands...

1304
02:36:09,248 --> 02:36:12,752
Love is now mingled with grief.

1305
02:36:25,389 --> 02:36:28,100
What now becomes of this fellowship?

1306
02:36:28,643 --> 02:36:31,646
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

1307
02:36:34,607 --> 02:36:37,902
The quest stands upon the edge
of a knife.

1308
02:36:38,069 --> 02:36:41,155
Stray but a little and it will fail...

1309
02:36:41,906 --> 02:36:44,742
To the ruin of all.

1310
02:36:49,080 --> 02:36:54,919
Yet hope remains
while the company is true.

1311
02:36:56,462 --> 02:37:01,175
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...

1312
02:37:01,634 --> 02:37:05,304
For you are weary with sorrow
and much toil.

1313
02:37:07,556 --> 02:37:09,684
Tonight, you will sleep...

1314
02:37:09,850 --> 02:37:13,270
Galadriel:
Welcome, Frodo of the shire...

1315
02:37:14,855 --> 02:37:16,649
One who has seen the eye!

1316
02:37:31,288 --> 02:37:33,874
A lament for Gandalf.

1317
02:37:41,132 --> 02:37:42,675
What do they say about him?

1318
02:37:42,883 --> 02:37:45,553
I have not the heart to tell you.

1319
02:37:48,305 --> 02:37:50,558
For me, the grief is still too near.

1320
02:37:53,519 --> 02:37:56,355
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.

1321
02:37:56,522 --> 02:37:59,567
There should be a verse about them.

1322
02:38:03,112 --> 02:38:05,114
The finest rockets ever seen

1323
02:38:06,240 --> 02:38:09,076
they burst in stars of blue and green

1324
02:38:09,994 --> 02:38:13,414
or after thunder, silver showers

1325
02:38:15,916 --> 02:38:18,711
Came falling like a rain of flowers

1326
02:38:18,878 --> 02:38:22,757
oh, that doesn't do them justice
by a long road.

1327
02:38:33,601 --> 02:38:36,270
Aragorn: Take some rest.

1328
02:38:36,437 --> 02:38:39,148
These borders are well-protected.

1329
02:38:39,356 --> 02:38:41,901
I will find no rest here.

1330
02:38:44,737 --> 02:38:47,740
I heard her voice inside my head.

1331
02:38:47,948 --> 02:38:51,702
She spoke of my father
and the fall of gondor.

1332
02:38:51,911 --> 02:38:57,374
She said to me,
"even now there is hope left."

1333
02:38:58,751 --> 02:39:01,587
But I cannot see it.

1334
02:39:02,922 --> 02:39:05,424
It is long since we had any hope.

1335
02:39:15,601 --> 02:39:17,728
My father is a noble man.

1336
02:39:18,479 --> 02:39:20,731
But his rule is failing...

1337
02:39:21,065 --> 02:39:26,487
And our people lose faith.

1338
02:39:27,905 --> 02:39:31,450
He looks to me to make things right,
and I would do it.

1339
02:39:31,617 --> 02:39:35,162
I would see the glory
of gondor restored.

1340
02:39:37,998 --> 02:39:41,001
Have you ever seen it, aragorn?

1341
02:39:41,627 --> 02:39:43,671
The white tower of ecthelion.

1342
02:39:43,838 --> 02:39:47,675
Glimmering like a spike
of Pearl and silver.

1343
02:39:48,342 --> 02:39:51,846
Its banners caught high
in the morning breeze.

1344
02:39:54,723 --> 02:39:56,684
Have you ever been called home...

1345
02:39:56,851 --> 02:40:00,813
By the clear ringing
of silver trumpets?

1346
02:40:01,438 --> 02:40:04,692
I have seen the white city...

1347
02:40:05,025 --> 02:40:06,527
Long ago.

1348
02:40:07,486 --> 02:40:12,449
One day, our paths will lead us there.

1349
02:40:13,367 --> 02:40:16,328
And the tower guard
shall take up the call:

1350
02:40:16,787 --> 02:40:20,124
"The lords of gondor have returned."

1351
02:41:27,316 --> 02:41:29,860
Will you look into the mirror?

1352
02:41:30,027 --> 02:41:31,570
What will I see?

1353
02:41:34,531 --> 02:41:36,867
Even the wisest cannot tell.

1354
02:41:37,785 --> 02:41:39,620
For the mirror...

1355
02:41:39,828 --> 02:41:42,373
Shows many things.

1356
02:41:45,376 --> 02:41:47,753
Things that were...

1357
02:41:47,962 --> 02:41:50,547
Things that are...

1358
02:41:51,298 --> 02:41:53,259
And some things...

1359
02:41:56,845 --> 02:42:00,140
That have not yet come to pass.

1360
02:43:22,723 --> 02:43:25,559
I know what it is you saw.

1361
02:43:27,978 --> 02:43:30,481
For it is also in my mind.

1362
02:43:32,232 --> 02:43:36,320
It is what will come to pass
if you should fail.

1363
02:43:38,697 --> 02:43:43,577
The fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.

1364
02:43:44,203 --> 02:43:47,498
He will try to take the ring.

1365
02:43:47,706 --> 02:43:49,708
You know of whom I speak.

1366
02:43:50,709 --> 02:43:55,381
One by one, it will destroy them all.

1367
02:43:56,882 --> 02:43:59,343
Frodo: If you ask it of me...

1368
02:43:59,718 --> 02:44:02,763
I will give you the one ring.

1369
02:44:03,847 --> 02:44:06,016
You offer it to me freely.

1370
02:44:10,604 --> 02:44:14,525
I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.

1371
02:44:20,906 --> 02:44:24,201
In place of a dark lord,
you would have a queen...

1372
02:44:24,618 --> 02:44:28,455
Not dark but beautiful,
and terrible as the dawn!

1373
02:44:29,081 --> 02:44:32,126
Treacherous as the sea!

1374
02:44:32,626 --> 02:44:37,548
Stronger than the foundations
of the earth!

1375
02:44:38,006 --> 02:44:40,384
All shall love me...

1376
02:44:40,592 --> 02:44:43,429
And despair.

1377
02:44:57,526 --> 02:45:01,822
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1378
02:45:02,114 --> 02:45:04,575
And go into the west...

1379
02:45:04,783 --> 02:45:09,246
- And remain Galadriel.
- I cannot do this alone.

1380
02:45:12,833 --> 02:45:17,004
You are a ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a ring of power...

1381
02:45:17,921 --> 02:45:19,423
Is to be alone.

1382
02:45:22,759 --> 02:45:25,512
This is nenya,
the ring of adamant.

1383
02:45:25,679 --> 02:45:27,306
And I am its keeper.

1384
02:45:30,517 --> 02:45:34,146
This task was appointed to you.

1385
02:45:35,189 --> 02:45:38,066
And if you do not find a way...

1386
02:45:39,276 --> 02:45:41,278
No one will.

1387
02:45:41,653 --> 02:45:44,823
Then I know what I must do.

1388
02:45:45,491 --> 02:45:46,700
It's just...

1389
02:45:49,953 --> 02:45:52,206
I'm afraid to do it.

1390
02:45:55,709 --> 02:46:00,839
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

1391
02:46:06,178 --> 02:46:11,892
Do you know how the orcs
first came into being?

1392
02:46:12,684 --> 02:46:16,021
They were elves once.

1393
02:46:17,189 --> 02:46:20,526
Taken by the dark powers...

1394
02:46:20,734 --> 02:46:23,904
Tortured and mutilated.

1395
02:46:24,238 --> 02:46:29,535
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1396
02:46:29,826 --> 02:46:31,662
And now...

1397
02:46:33,121 --> 02:46:34,998
Perfected.

1398
02:46:35,707 --> 02:46:38,877
My fighting uruk-hai...

1399
02:46:40,837 --> 02:46:43,173
Whom do you serve?

1400
02:46:43,382 --> 02:46:45,884
Saruman!

1401
02:47:06,738 --> 02:47:10,200
Hunt them down. Do not stop
until they are found.

1402
02:47:10,409 --> 02:47:13,287
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

1403
02:47:13,537 --> 02:47:16,456
You will taste man-flesh!

1404
02:47:21,545 --> 02:47:25,257
One of the halflings carries
something of great value.

1405
02:47:25,424 --> 02:47:29,595
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1406
02:47:51,908 --> 02:47:57,331
Celeborn: Never before have we clad
strangers in the garb of our own people.

1407
02:47:58,457 --> 02:48:02,294
May these cloaks help shield you
from unfriendly eyes.

1408
02:48:09,468 --> 02:48:11,011
Lembas.

1409
02:48:11,261 --> 02:48:12,846
Elvish waybread.

1410
02:48:15,349 --> 02:48:18,352
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

1411
02:48:24,858 --> 02:48:26,818
How many did you eat?

1412
02:48:26,985 --> 02:48:28,654
Foun

1413
02:48:34,451 --> 02:48:37,051
Celeborn: Every league you travel south,
the danger will increase.

1414
02:48:37,245 --> 02:48:41,375
Mordor orcs now hold the eastern shore
of the anduin.

1415
02:48:41,541 --> 02:48:44,044
Nor will you find safety
on the western bank.

1416
02:48:44,252 --> 02:48:48,048
Strange creatures bearing the white hand
have been seen on our borders.

1417
02:48:48,256 --> 02:48:53,345
Seldom do orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

1418
02:49:05,941 --> 02:49:07,418
By river you have the chance...

1419
02:49:07,442 --> 02:49:10,654
Of outrunning the enemy
to the falls of rauros.

1420
02:49:27,921 --> 02:49:32,759
Galadriel: My gift for you, Legolas,
is a bow of the galadhrim.

1421
02:49:33,009 --> 02:49:36,513
Worthy of the skill
of our woodland kin.

1422
02:49:41,893 --> 02:49:44,354
These are the daggers of the noldorin.

1423
02:49:44,521 --> 02:49:48,525
They have already seen service in war.

1424
02:49:48,692 --> 02:49:50,944
Do not fear, young peregrin took.

1425
02:49:51,111 --> 02:49:54,448
You will find your courage.

1426
02:49:56,324 --> 02:49:58,285
And for you, samwise gamgee...

1427
02:49:58,452 --> 02:50:01,037
Elven rope made of hithlain.

1428
02:50:01,204 --> 02:50:03,331
Thank you, my lady.

1429
02:50:05,125 --> 02:50:08,462
Have you run out
of those nice, shiny daggers?

1430
02:50:14,926 --> 02:50:17,971
And what gift would a dwarf ask
of the elves?

1431
02:50:18,138 --> 02:50:20,265
Nothing.

1432
02:50:20,891 --> 02:50:24,227
Except to look upon the lady
of the galadhrim one last time...

1433
02:50:24,853 --> 02:50:30,066
For she is more fair
than all the jewels beneath the earth.

1434
02:50:37,115 --> 02:50:38,658
Actually...

1435
02:50:38,867 --> 02:50:40,494
There was one thing.

1436
02:50:41,328 --> 02:50:43,997
No, no, I'm talking nonsense.
It's quite impossible.

1437
02:50:44,164 --> 02:50:46,958
Stupid to ask.

1438
02:50:49,503 --> 02:50:51,630
Galadriel:
I have nothing greater to give...

1439
02:50:51,797 --> 02:50:55,383
Than the gift you already bear.

1440
02:51:21,034 --> 02:51:24,120
That choice is yet before her.

1441
02:51:24,704 --> 02:51:27,624
You have your own choice to make,
aragorn.

1442
02:51:27,958 --> 02:51:33,797
To rise above the height of all
your fathers since the days of elendil...

1443
02:51:33,964 --> 02:51:38,301
Or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

1444
02:52:05,871 --> 02:52:09,082
Farewell, Frodo Baggins.

1445
02:52:09,249 --> 02:52:12,669
I give you the light of earendil...

1446
02:52:13,420 --> 02:52:15,755
Our most beloved star.

1447
02:52:24,890 --> 02:52:29,269
May it be a light for you
in dark places...

1448
02:52:29,519 --> 02:52:33,607
When all other lights go out.

1449
02:52:42,449 --> 02:52:45,619
Gimli: I have taken my worst wound
at this parting...

1450
02:52:46,244 --> 02:52:50,540
Having looked my last upon that
which is fairest.

1451
02:52:51,291 --> 02:52:54,628
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

1452
02:52:54,878 --> 02:52:56,796
What was her gift?

1453
02:52:57,005 --> 02:53:01,927
I asked her for one hair
from her golden head.

1454
02:53:02,719 --> 02:53:05,597
She gave me three.

1455
02:54:47,741 --> 02:54:51,202
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

1456
02:54:54,914 --> 02:54:58,043
I had hoped we would lose him
on the river.

1457
02:54:58,251 --> 02:55:01,421
But he's too clever a waterman.

1458
02:55:02,255 --> 02:55:05,592
And if he alerts the enemy
to our whereabouts...

1459
02:55:05,759 --> 02:55:08,011
It will make the crossing
even more dangerous.

1460
02:55:08,178 --> 02:55:10,263
Sam: Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

1461
02:55:10,430 --> 02:55:13,516
- No, Sam.
- You haven't eaten anything all day.

1462
02:55:13,683 --> 02:55:16,770
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

1463
02:55:17,729 --> 02:55:20,732
- Mr. Frodo...
- I'm all right.

1464
02:55:20,899 --> 02:55:22,067
But you're not.

1465
02:55:22,358 --> 02:55:24,861
I'm here to help you.

1466
02:55:25,028 --> 02:55:26,738
I promised Gandalf that I would.

1467
02:55:32,702 --> 02:55:35,455
You can't help me, Sam.

1468
02:55:42,212 --> 02:55:44,297
Get some sleep.

1469
02:55:50,553 --> 02:55:52,764
Minas tirith is the safer road.

1470
02:55:53,306 --> 02:55:56,059
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

1471
02:55:56,726 --> 02:55:58,978
Strike out for mordor from a place
of strength.

1472
02:55:59,312 --> 02:56:02,190
There is no strength in gondor
that can avail us.

1473
02:56:02,649 --> 02:56:04,651
You were quick enough to trust
the elves.

1474
02:56:06,486 --> 02:56:09,322
Have you so little faith
in your own people?

1475
02:56:09,489 --> 02:56:12,492
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

1476
02:56:12,700 --> 02:56:15,995
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in men.

1477
02:56:16,246 --> 02:56:18,456
But you will not see that.

1478
02:56:18,790 --> 02:56:20,208
You are afraid!

1479
02:56:20,458 --> 02:56:23,002
All your life, you have hidden
in the shadows.

1480
02:56:23,294 --> 02:56:26,756
Scared of who you are,
of what you are.

1481
02:56:29,175 --> 02:56:33,513
I will not lead the ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

1482
02:56:45,358 --> 02:56:46,734
Frodo.

1483
02:56:48,611 --> 02:56:50,113
The argonath.

1484
02:56:53,533 --> 02:56:57,287
Long have I desired
to look upon the kings of old.

1485
02:56:58,037 --> 02:56:59,956
My kin.

1486
02:58:18,952 --> 02:58:21,120
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1487
02:58:21,371 --> 02:58:23,957
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1488
02:58:24,123 --> 02:58:27,627
- We approach mordor from the north.
- Oh, yes?

1489
02:58:28,044 --> 02:58:31,881
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through emyn muil...

1490
02:58:32,048 --> 02:58:35,301
An impassable labyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks.

1491
02:58:35,468 --> 02:58:38,596
And after that, it gets even better.

1492
02:58:38,972 --> 02:58:43,935
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

1493
02:58:44,102 --> 02:58:45,478
That is our road.

1494
02:58:47,063 --> 02:58:50,275
I suggest you take some rest
and recover your strength, master dwarf.

1495
02:58:50,483 --> 02:58:52,235
Recover my...

1496
02:58:55,238 --> 02:58:57,240
- We should leave now.
- No.

1497
02:58:57,407 --> 02:59:01,869
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

1498
02:59:02,078 --> 02:59:05,498
It is not the eastern shore
that worries me.

1499
02:59:05,748 --> 02:59:09,752
A shadow and a threat
has been growing in my mind.

1500
02:59:10,253 --> 02:59:14,424
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

1501
02:59:16,426 --> 02:59:21,389
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young hobbit.

1502
02:59:21,889 --> 02:59:23,599
Where's Frodo?

1503
02:59:49,208 --> 02:59:51,127
Boromir:
None of us should wander alone.

1504
02:59:52,545 --> 02:59:54,630
You, least of all.

1505
02:59:54,839 --> 02:59:57,300
So much depends on you.

1506
02:59:58,343 --> 03:00:00,303
Frodo?

1507
03:00:07,435 --> 03:00:09,979
I know why you seek solitude.

1508
03:00:10,688 --> 03:00:14,150
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1509
03:00:14,942 --> 03:00:17,987
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1510
03:00:19,572 --> 03:00:22,200
There are other ways, Frodo.

1511
03:00:22,450 --> 03:00:26,245
- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say.

1512
03:00:26,496 --> 03:00:30,249
It would seem like wisdom
but for the warning in my heart.

1513
03:00:30,500 --> 03:00:33,586
Warning? Against what?

1514
03:00:33,753 --> 03:00:35,880
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1515
03:00:36,089 --> 03:00:39,717
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

1516
03:00:39,967 --> 03:00:43,721
- Don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.

1517
03:00:45,515 --> 03:00:48,851
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

1518
03:00:50,395 --> 03:00:52,480
- If you would but lend me the ring.
- No.

1519
03:00:53,689 --> 03:00:57,360
- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.

1520
03:00:59,195 --> 03:01:02,532
What chance do you think you have?

1521
03:01:02,698 --> 03:01:07,370
They will find you.
They will take the ring.

1522
03:01:07,620 --> 03:01:11,290
And you will beg for death
before the end!

1523
03:01:13,418 --> 03:01:15,545
You fool!

1524
03:01:15,711 --> 03:01:19,715
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

1525
03:01:19,882 --> 03:01:22,718
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1526
03:01:22,885 --> 03:01:24,220
- Give it to me!
- No!

1527
03:01:24,387 --> 03:01:26,222
- Give it to me!
- No.

1528
03:01:33,896 --> 03:01:35,898
I see your mind.

1529
03:01:36,149 --> 03:01:39,068
You will take the ring to Sauron!

1530
03:01:39,277 --> 03:01:41,154
You will betray us!

1531
03:01:41,404 --> 03:01:44,574
You'll go to your death,
and the death of us all!

1532
03:01:45,032 --> 03:01:48,661
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

1533
03:01:55,751 --> 03:01:57,253
Frodo?

1534
03:02:01,591 --> 03:02:03,176
Frodo.

1535
03:02:07,096 --> 03:02:09,098
What have I done?

1536
03:02:09,307 --> 03:02:11,058
Please, Frodo.

1537
03:02:11,267 --> 03:02:13,936
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1538
03:03:02,485 --> 03:03:03,903
Frodo?

1539
03:03:05,154 --> 03:03:08,241
- It has taken Boromir.
- Where is the ring?

1540
03:03:08,491 --> 03:03:10,243
Stay away!

1541
03:03:14,497 --> 03:03:18,334
- I swore to protect you.
- Can you protect me from yourself?

1542
03:03:28,010 --> 03:03:30,513
Would you destroy it?

1543
03:03:35,518 --> 03:03:37,436
Voice of the ring: Aragorn.

1544
03:03:40,856 --> 03:03:43,192
Aragorn.

1545
03:03:45,027 --> 03:03:46,862
Elessar.

1546
03:03:54,537 --> 03:03:57,873
I would have gone with you to the end.

1547
03:03:58,541 --> 03:04:01,377
Into the very fires of mordor.

1548
03:04:04,714 --> 03:04:05,881
I know.

1549
03:04:08,384 --> 03:04:13,806
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

1550
03:04:17,560 --> 03:04:19,312
Go, Frodo!

1551
03:05:01,228 --> 03:05:02,980
Find the halfling!

1552
03:05:04,607 --> 03:05:07,151
Find the halfling!

1553
03:05:18,788 --> 03:05:20,373
Aragorn, go!

1554
03:05:42,061 --> 03:05:43,396
Pippin: Frodo!

1555
03:05:43,979 --> 03:05:45,564
Hide here. Quick!

1556
03:05:46,190 --> 03:05:47,650
Come on!

1557
03:05:50,152 --> 03:05:52,154
What's he doing?

1558
03:05:56,409 --> 03:05:58,411
He's leaving.

1559
03:06:11,006 --> 03:06:13,342
Merry: Run, Frodo. Go on!

1560
03:06:13,926 --> 03:06:17,012
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Over here!

1561
03:06:17,430 --> 03:06:19,014
- Over here!
- This way!

1562
03:06:29,859 --> 03:06:32,194
- It's working!
- I know it's working! Run!

1563
03:07:27,583 --> 03:07:30,628
- The horn of gondor.
- Boromir.

1564
03:11:51,889 --> 03:11:54,933
- They took the little ones.
- Hold still.

1565
03:11:55,267 --> 03:11:57,352
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1566
03:11:59,229 --> 03:12:00,647
I let Frodo go.

1567
03:12:01,356 --> 03:12:03,942
Then you did what I could not.

1568
03:12:04,943 --> 03:12:08,280
I tried to take the ring from him.

1569
03:12:08,781 --> 03:12:13,077
- The ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me.

1570
03:12:13,285 --> 03:12:15,579
I did not see it.

1571
03:12:15,788 --> 03:12:18,957
- I have failed you all.
- No, Boromir.

1572
03:12:19,416 --> 03:12:21,960
You fought bravely.

1573
03:12:22,252 --> 03:12:24,922
You have kept your honor.

1574
03:12:25,464 --> 03:12:27,424
Boromir: Leaveit

1575
03:12:27,758 --> 03:12:29,802
it is over.

1576
03:12:30,969 --> 03:12:36,266
The world of men will fall.
And all will come to darkness...

1577
03:12:36,683 --> 03:12:39,686
And my city to ruin.

1578
03:12:43,774 --> 03:12:46,485
I do not know what strength
is in my blood...

1579
03:12:46,652 --> 03:12:50,656
But I swear to you,
I will not let the white city fall...

1580
03:12:51,657 --> 03:12:54,159
Nor our people fail.

1581
03:12:55,160 --> 03:12:56,495
Our people.

1582
03:13:00,332 --> 03:13:02,459
Our people.

1583
03:13:24,189 --> 03:13:27,192
I would have followed you, my brother.

1584
03:13:28,735 --> 03:13:30,737
My captain.

1585
03:13:33,365 --> 03:13:35,325
My king.

1586
03:13:54,970 --> 03:13:57,222
Be at peace...

1587
03:13:57,556 --> 03:13:59,558
Son of gondor.

1588
03:14:16,074 --> 03:14:19,411
They will look for his coming
from the white tower.

1589
03:14:19,912 --> 03:14:22,915
But he will not return.

1590
03:15:07,584 --> 03:15:10,837
Frodo:
I wish the ring had never come to me.

1591
03:15:12,130 --> 03:15:15,133
I wish none of this had happened.

1592
03:15:18,095 --> 03:15:20,847
Gandalf: So do all who live
to see such times...

1593
03:15:21,056 --> 03:15:24,476
But that is not for them to decide.

1594
03:15:24,643 --> 03:15:27,312
All you have to decide...

1595
03:15:27,562 --> 03:15:32,317
Is what to do with the time
that is given to you.

1596
03:16:01,138 --> 03:16:03,181
Frodo, no!

1597
03:16:05,851 --> 03:16:08,520
- Mr. Frodo!
- No, Sam.

1598
03:16:12,024 --> 03:16:14,026
Go back, Sam!

1599
03:16:14,526 --> 03:16:18,113
- I'm going to mordor alone.
- Of course you are.

1600
03:16:18,322 --> 03:16:21,158
And I'm coming with you!

1601
03:16:21,616 --> 03:16:24,036
You can't swim!

1602
03:17:17,381 --> 03:17:20,092
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1603
03:17:20,425 --> 03:17:24,763
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, samwise gamgee."

1604
03:17:25,889 --> 03:17:28,475
And I don't mean to.

1605
03:17:28,767 --> 03:17:30,936
I don't mean to.

1606
03:17:49,287 --> 03:17:50,956
Come on.

1607
03:18:19,443 --> 03:18:23,989
Hurry! Frodo and Sam
have reached the eastern shore.

1608
03:18:38,837 --> 03:18:43,842
- You mean not to follow them.
- Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1609
03:18:47,304 --> 03:18:52,184
Then it has all been in vain.
The fellowship has failed.

1610
03:19:04,029 --> 03:19:07,199
Not if we hold true to each other.

1611
03:19:08,533 --> 03:19:13,038
We will not abandon merry and pippin
to torment and death.

1612
03:19:14,039 --> 03:19:19,294
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1613
03:19:20,545 --> 03:19:22,589
We travel light.

1614
03:19:22,797 --> 03:19:24,716
Let us hunt some orc.

1615
03:19:48,698 --> 03:19:50,116
Frodo: Mordor.

1616
03:19:50,742 --> 03:19:54,120
I hope the others find a safer road.

1617
03:19:55,080 --> 03:19:57,624
Strider will look after them.

1618
03:19:58,583 --> 03:20:01,920
I don't suppose
we'll ever see them again.

1619
03:20:02,254 --> 03:20:04,714
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1620
03:20:04,923 --> 03:20:06,424
We may.

1621
03:20:13,223 --> 03:20:15,850
I'm glad you are with me.
