1
00:01:42,342 --> 00:01:43,644
[sighs]

2
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:01,795
Morning.

3
00:02:04,565 --> 00:02:05,799
I don't need a permit.

4
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,105
You with fish and wildlife, or something?

5
00:02:12,172 --> 00:02:13,173
Because otherwise you...

6
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,842
USGS land survey.

7
00:02:16,276 --> 00:02:20,180
You guys still aren't finished with that crap, huh?

8
00:02:20,247 --> 00:02:22,749
It's been three months.

9
00:02:22,816 --> 00:02:26,153
Started as a tiny sinkhole. Now look at this place.

10
00:02:28,722 --> 00:02:33,460
Government's just gonna blame it on global warming call it a day.

11
00:02:33,527 --> 00:02:35,095
Well, you know us liberals.

12
00:02:35,162 --> 00:02:37,798
We just aren't happy unless we're blaming something.

13
00:02:39,032 --> 00:02:40,834
My cousin was in one of those houses.

14
00:02:43,537 --> 00:02:45,372
That whole area is in a flood zone.

15
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,508
That's the answer.

16
00:02:47,574 --> 00:02:52,246
More government, more permits, more zones.

17
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:57,184
He lived in a flood zone, jackass, not a sink zone.

18
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,122
Okay.

19
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:05,626
You see over there under the water is limestone

20
00:03:05,692 --> 00:03:08,495
and over there,

21
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:10,097
all that sand was underground,

22
00:03:10,163 --> 00:03:13,100
pushed up by water to the surface.

23
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,968
Called a sandblow.

24
00:03:15,035 --> 00:03:17,471
And when water pushes sand out of the way

25
00:03:17,538 --> 00:03:19,172
and dissolves the limestone,

26
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:21,108
it creates holes.

27
00:03:21,174 --> 00:03:24,912
Over time the weight of the houses causes the collapse.

28
00:03:24,978 --> 00:03:26,980
Now your cousin would have known that

29
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:29,583
if he had read any of the info that was sent to him about this.

30
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,085
He and I know well enough to know

31
00:03:32,152 --> 00:03:34,054
that his house didn't cause that...

32
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:36,490
- Wait.
- Don't tell me to wait.

33
00:03:36,557 --> 00:03:38,492
- I have every right...
- No, no, quiet!

34
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:40,894
[rumbling]

35
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,732
- What is that?
- Get off the dock!

36
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:48,268
- Whoa!
- It's an earthquake!

37
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:53,173
Come on, come on!

38
00:03:55,909 --> 00:03:57,377
Help me, help me!

39
00:03:57,444 --> 00:03:59,146
Help me!

40
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,448
What the heck was that?

41
00:04:01,515 --> 00:04:02,983
A surface rupture.

42
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,017
Oh my God.

43
00:04:04,084 --> 00:04:05,852
- [laughing]
- It's amazing.

44
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:08,755
You saved my life.

45
00:04:08,822 --> 00:04:10,724
Can I buy you a beer?

46
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,693
Yeah, sounds good.

47
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:15,996
I mean, but... It's amazing. Look.

48
00:04:16,063 --> 00:04:17,764
How deep do you think that is?

49
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:20,100
Now, be careful.

50
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:23,070
- Don't go too close, sir.
- Gotta be at least...

51
00:04:23,136 --> 00:04:25,072
[rumbling]

52
00:04:25,138 --> 00:04:26,173
[screams]

53
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,043
[rumbling]

54
00:05:16,356 --> 00:05:18,125
[honking]

55
00:05:23,997 --> 00:05:26,366
Eric, come on, we're going to be late!

56
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:27,901
[honking]

57
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:29,436
- Come on!
- All right.

58
00:05:48,855 --> 00:05:50,490
You know that being late on your first day

59
00:05:50,557 --> 00:05:51,625
is pretty crappy, right?

60
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:52,826
Mm-hmm.

61
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,452
What are you doing?

62
00:06:18,518 --> 00:06:20,153
Dude, don't you care that we're going to be late?

63
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,922
Like, all you do is play on your phone

64
00:06:21,988 --> 00:06:23,757
and you literally move like a snail.

65
00:06:23,824 --> 00:06:26,026
Do you care about this job at all?

66
00:06:26,093 --> 00:06:28,829
No, I don't care about this job at all.

67
00:06:28,895 --> 00:06:30,664
What?

68
00:06:30,731 --> 00:06:33,500
Eric, there's nothing wrong with a hard day's work.

69
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:36,770
It's how you find a passion, like a career.

70
00:06:36,837 --> 00:06:38,438
Whatever you say.

71
00:06:40,006 --> 00:06:42,075
Wow, so you don't have any passions, huh?

72
00:06:44,177 --> 00:06:47,013
I mean, maybe I'd want to be a pilot.

73
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,218
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

74
00:06:51,284 --> 00:06:56,056
What, like, Air Force? Commercial?

75
00:06:58,158 --> 00:07:00,093
Yeah, I don't know, but...

76
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,529
my dad taught me how to fly a helicopter.

77
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:03,797
It's so sweet.

78
00:07:03,864 --> 00:07:04,798
I bet.

79
00:07:04,865 --> 00:07:06,566
[alarm sounding]

80
00:07:10,337 --> 00:07:12,439
Please, please turn that off.

81
00:07:12,506 --> 00:07:15,408
The earth doesn't take a break, so I don't either.

82
00:07:15,475 --> 00:07:17,477
Okay.

83
00:07:17,544 --> 00:07:18,912
Wait.

84
00:07:22,549 --> 00:07:24,251
Is that an earthquake?

85
00:07:24,317 --> 00:07:25,819
A what?

86
00:07:26,686 --> 00:07:27,888
[rumbling]

87
00:07:27,954 --> 00:07:28,889
Brenda, stop the car!

88
00:07:28,955 --> 00:07:30,257
[screams]

89
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,269
[shouting]

90
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,872
- [panting]
- We're okay.

91
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,915
- Brenda?
- Okay...

92
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:55,916
- Brenda!
- All right, all right.

93
00:07:55,982 --> 00:07:58,084
We're okay, we're okay.

94
00:07:58,151 --> 00:08:01,721
We just need to think about getting out of here...

95
00:08:01,788 --> 00:08:05,959
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- ...logically, and not panic.

96
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,065
It's got to be at least 20 feet down.

97
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:14,367
Deeper than that.

98
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:17,504
- Don't move, don't move.
- I'm not.

99
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:18,972
All right.

100
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,115
Mom, don't walk away from me while I'm talking.

101
00:08:29,182 --> 00:08:30,517
What did I say about slamming doors?

102
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:32,252
Oh, so the door has rights, but I don't.

103
00:08:32,319 --> 00:08:33,320
We just had a major seismic event.

104
00:08:33,386 --> 00:08:34,821
I don't have time for this.

105
00:08:34,888 --> 00:08:36,523
Mom, it's not fair, you said when I turned 18,

106
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,958
I could do what I wanted.

107
00:08:38,024 --> 00:08:39,960
Well, I'm 18 and I want to move to Dad's in Marston.

108
00:08:40,026 --> 00:08:41,962
I don't think he's going to help me fight global warming.

109
00:08:42,028 --> 00:08:43,530
In fact, fracking is the exact opposite.

110
00:08:43,597 --> 00:08:44,898
Look, Mom...

111
00:08:44,965 --> 00:08:46,700
Okay, sorry to interrupt this beautiful mother-daughter moment

112
00:08:46,766 --> 00:08:49,536
happening here, but we just got the official data on the quake.

113
00:08:49,603 --> 00:08:53,673
The US Geological Survey just revised it to a 5.7.

114
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,142
Missouri's agency is registering it as something different,

115
00:08:56,209 --> 00:08:58,511
and I read the tracker wrong.

116
00:08:58,578 --> 00:09:02,749
USGS just said 5.9.

117
00:09:02,816 --> 00:09:04,050
Should we do a cross-check

118
00:09:04,117 --> 00:09:05,919
with the State Emergency Management Agency?

119
00:09:05,986 --> 00:09:09,356
Nope, USGS is better equipped than SEMA.

120
00:09:09,422 --> 00:09:12,559
Did you check our seismographs for a more detailed reading?

121
00:09:12,626 --> 00:09:14,461
No, sorry.

122
00:09:14,527 --> 00:09:15,629
No apologies.

123
00:09:15,695 --> 00:09:17,330
5.9 means there's going to be some damage,

124
00:09:17,397 --> 00:09:18,698
possible fissures around the city.

125
00:09:18,765 --> 00:09:21,268
Epicenter is two miles south of New Madrid.

126
00:09:21,334 --> 00:09:23,904
A couple aftershocks, but nothing major.

127
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,206
3.1 and a 2.9.

128
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:28,475
Two miles south of the town of New Madrid,

129
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:31,077
or south of the epicenter of the New Madrid fault line?

130
00:09:31,144 --> 00:09:33,013
South of the town.

131
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:35,248
Mom, we're not done with this conversation.

132
00:09:35,315 --> 00:09:37,050
Your brother could be in real trouble.

133
00:09:37,117 --> 00:09:39,286
We can talk about this later, Emily.

134
00:09:39,352 --> 00:09:42,055
Ooh. Crazy morning already, huh?

135
00:09:42,122 --> 00:09:44,457
- Thought you could use this.
- Thanks, babe.

136
00:09:44,524 --> 00:09:46,626
Yeah, we're in for a long one if these aftershocks keep up.

137
00:09:46,693 --> 00:09:48,128
Fine with me.

138
00:09:48,194 --> 00:09:49,629
It means we're going to spend more time together.

139
00:09:57,203 --> 00:09:58,972
Your brother isn't picking up.

140
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,307
Of course he isn't.

141
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:02,075
He just found out about Finn proposing.

142
00:10:04,144 --> 00:10:05,879
It's fine.

143
00:10:05,946 --> 00:10:07,814
Why don't you try to call Brenda?

144
00:10:07,881 --> 00:10:09,683
I'll keep checking Eric.

145
00:10:09,749 --> 00:10:12,218
Mom, please, can we finish this conversation?

146
00:10:12,285 --> 00:10:14,521
Why is he not picking up?

147
00:10:16,222 --> 00:10:18,058
Why would you want to move in with your dad, huh?

148
00:10:18,124 --> 00:10:20,627
He's going to get me a job that pays.

149
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,265
Let's take this inside. I have work to do.

150
00:10:33,974 --> 00:10:35,408
[sighs]

151
00:10:35,475 --> 00:10:37,677
Eric refused to do anything else but work for him,

152
00:10:37,744 --> 00:10:39,245
which is why I allowed it.

153
00:10:39,312 --> 00:10:42,248
It's an opportunity to do something important.

154
00:10:42,315 --> 00:10:44,751
I mean, yeah, it may be working for the wrong side,

155
00:10:44,818 --> 00:10:47,420
but I can make changes there.

156
00:10:47,487 --> 00:10:51,291
And I can help and send some money for the house.

157
00:10:51,358 --> 00:10:52,993
Don't even go there.

158
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:54,694
Finn and I are doing just fine.

159
00:10:54,761 --> 00:10:56,262
I didn't mean...

160
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:57,964
I don't want to make you upset again.

161
00:10:58,031 --> 00:10:59,666
I just... I want to help.

162
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:01,735
Benda didn't the answer, but I went ahead and used her phone

163
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:04,604
- to pinpoint the location.
- Thank you. Where are they?

164
00:11:04,671 --> 00:11:06,706
[rumbling]

165
00:11:06,773 --> 00:11:07,707
Feel that?

166
00:11:10,377 --> 00:11:13,480
Seismograph shows 6.1 and potentially growing.

167
00:11:13,546 --> 00:11:14,481
Hold tight!

168
00:11:21,955 --> 00:11:24,424
They're getting bigger.

169
00:11:24,491 --> 00:11:26,326
The magnitude topped at 6.4.

170
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:28,028
That's what I'm seeing, too.

171
00:11:28,094 --> 00:11:29,763
- Everyone okay?
- Yeah.

172
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:31,197
Let's make sure we didn't lose any connections out there.

173
00:11:31,264 --> 00:11:33,133
Carla, epicenter?

174
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:35,702
New Madrid. South of Marston.

175
00:11:43,043 --> 00:11:44,010
Everybody okay?

176
00:11:44,077 --> 00:11:45,011
Yeah.

177
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:46,212
Hope the sensors are all right.

178
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:47,614
Let's get this cleaned up.

179
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,084
Brenda? Brenda?

180
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:52,619
Mom! Mom! It's Brenda.

181
00:11:52,685 --> 00:11:54,020
They've been in an accident.

182
00:11:54,087 --> 00:11:56,089
It's Cami. What happened?

183
00:11:56,156 --> 00:11:57,524
Is Eric okay?

184
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,560
Just sit tight, okay? We're leaving now.

185
00:12:01,861 --> 00:12:03,396
Carla, Finn, stay here.

186
00:12:03,463 --> 00:12:05,065
Analyze the latest readings and get them to me ASAP.

187
00:12:05,131 --> 00:12:06,066
What's wrong?

188
00:12:06,132 --> 00:12:07,267
They need help.

189
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,002
Emily and I are going to New Madrid.

190
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:10,236
- I should go with you.
- No.

191
00:12:10,303 --> 00:12:12,238
I need you to monitor the tectonic AI.

192
00:12:12,305 --> 00:12:15,375
That software needs to be operating at 100%.

193
00:12:15,442 --> 00:12:17,343
The New Madrid fault is the largest on this continent.

194
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,845
If we're seeing this much activity,

195
00:12:18,912 --> 00:12:20,880
it means something way bigger could be on the way.

196
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:22,182
And we need to know about it.

197
00:12:22,248 --> 00:12:23,783
Like a 7 or an 8?

198
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,085
It's too soon to tell.

199
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:28,188
Well, there's sinkholes, shifts in the geologic table,

200
00:12:28,254 --> 00:12:29,756
massive sandblows emerging.

201
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,957
None of this is normal.

202
00:12:31,024 --> 00:12:32,258
[phone rings]

203
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,161
It's Alan.

204
00:12:35,228 --> 00:12:37,831
Text him. Tell him to meet us in New Madrid near the ravine.

205
00:12:37,897 --> 00:12:39,699
I'll call him on the road and tell him what's happening.

206
00:12:39,766 --> 00:12:41,734
Let me know as soon as Eric's safe.

207
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:42,869
- I will.
- I love you.

208
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:44,304
Love you, too.

209
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,738
- Are they going to be okay?
- We need to hurry.

210
00:13:06,926 --> 00:13:08,194
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

211
00:13:08,261 --> 00:13:09,929
No, listen to me. I'm Alan Weddle.

212
00:13:09,996 --> 00:13:12,031
I own half the fracking sites in this area.

213
00:13:12,098 --> 00:13:14,134
My son's stuck inside. I'm going in there to get him.

214
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,935
Sir, this is an evacuation site.

215
00:13:16,002 --> 00:13:17,804
I need you to get back in your truck and go ahead and leave.

216
00:13:17,871 --> 00:13:20,807
No, no, no. I don't care if I got to call the governor.

217
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:22,509
- I'm going in.
- Where is he? Where's Eric?

218
00:13:22,575 --> 00:13:24,344
- Hey, we got to go.
- I'm going to get my son.

219
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,979
- Yeah, we're going to get him.
- I'll keep an eye on 'em.

220
00:13:26,045 --> 00:13:27,247
- Eric?
- Eric.

221
00:13:27,313 --> 00:13:30,150
You in here, buddy?

222
00:13:30,216 --> 00:13:31,484
Guys, it's not safe to be in here.

223
00:13:31,551 --> 00:13:34,487
Eric, Brenda, you guys in here. Can you hear me?

224
00:13:34,554 --> 00:13:36,089
Eric!

225
00:13:36,156 --> 00:13:37,123
[rumbling]

226
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,424
Eric!

227
00:13:38,491 --> 00:13:39,626
- Eric!
- Eric!

228
00:13:39,692 --> 00:13:40,994
Mom!

229
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,296
- Hold on...
- Mom! Dad! Help!

230
00:13:43,363 --> 00:13:44,597
- Hear that?
- We're down here!

231
00:13:44,664 --> 00:13:45,865
- That's him.
- Help!

232
00:13:45,932 --> 00:13:47,433
- Eric! Eric!
- Mom!

233
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,701
- Hey.
- Eric, honey.

234
00:13:48,768 --> 00:13:50,370
Dad! We're in here.

235
00:13:50,436 --> 00:13:53,907
- Hey.
- Try to open the door.

236
00:13:53,973 --> 00:13:55,975
- Hang on, we'll come get you.
- Wait, the truck's slipping!

237
00:13:56,042 --> 00:13:57,744
It's moving.

238
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,179
I can't open it. I can't open it.

239
00:13:59,245 --> 00:14:02,315
- I'll get some rope!
- Okay.

240
00:14:02,382 --> 00:14:03,383
I can't open it!

241
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:05,185
I got it. I'm out!

242
00:14:05,251 --> 00:14:09,455
Hey. Hang on. Easy. Easy. I'm coming. I'm coming.

243
00:14:09,522 --> 00:14:11,291
Give me the rope, give me the rope! Okay.

244
00:14:11,357 --> 00:14:14,127
Oh! [gasps]

245
00:14:14,194 --> 00:14:15,128
Plates are shifting!

246
00:14:15,195 --> 00:14:16,529
How do you know that?

247
00:14:16,596 --> 00:14:18,364
I'm a geologist. It's why I'm here.

248
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:20,133
The whole area is a hotspot.

249
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,468
Stay put, don't move!

250
00:14:22,535 --> 00:14:23,903
Come on, hurry up!

251
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,038
Dad!

252
00:14:25,104 --> 00:14:26,372
Eric, sit tight, okay?

253
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:27,840
We need some slack. A little slack.

254
00:14:27,907 --> 00:14:28,841
Mom, get me out!

255
00:14:28,908 --> 00:14:30,476
All right. Here we go.

256
00:14:30,543 --> 00:14:31,711
Put this around your waist.

257
00:14:31,778 --> 00:14:33,146
Wrap it tight around your waist.

258
00:14:33,213 --> 00:14:34,247
Guys, we've got about two minutes!

259
00:14:34,314 --> 00:14:36,216
- Come on!
- Stay back.

260
00:14:36,282 --> 00:14:38,885
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

261
00:14:38,952 --> 00:14:40,553
Careful. Careful.

262
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,222
I got you. I got you. Ready?

263
00:14:42,288 --> 00:14:43,756
- Give me your hand.
- Okay.

264
00:14:43,823 --> 00:14:44,791
I got you.

265
00:14:44,857 --> 00:14:45,792
Pull. Pull. Pull.

266
00:14:45,858 --> 00:14:47,860
- Pull!
- Nice and easy, pull.

267
00:14:47,927 --> 00:14:50,496
Pull. Come on!

268
00:14:52,232 --> 00:14:54,000
- Ah!
- Easy, easy, easy.

269
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:55,235
You got it. You got it.

270
00:14:55,301 --> 00:14:57,437
Just slide, slide, slide.

271
00:14:57,503 --> 00:14:59,872
Okay, all right. Okay.

272
00:14:59,939 --> 00:15:02,275
- Dad! Dad!
- Good, good, good, good, good.

273
00:15:02,342 --> 00:15:03,610
Dad!

274
00:15:03,676 --> 00:15:05,411
You got her? Eric, hang on.

275
00:15:05,478 --> 00:15:08,348
Here I come, buddy. Here I come.

276
00:15:08,414 --> 00:15:09,515
Coming down.

277
00:15:09,582 --> 00:15:12,185
[shouting, rumbling]

278
00:15:12,252 --> 00:15:14,087
Okay...

279
00:15:14,153 --> 00:15:16,389
- The truck is slipping!
- It's gonna fall.

280
00:15:16,456 --> 00:15:17,690
Dad, get me out of here.

281
00:15:17,757 --> 00:15:18,958
Hang on, buddy, hang on. Here it goes.

282
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:21,494
Get this around your waist.

283
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:24,564
Get it around your waist. I need slack.

284
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:28,268
You got it, give me your hand.

285
00:15:28,334 --> 00:15:29,736
Okay, go, pull! Pull!

286
00:15:31,704 --> 00:15:34,407
- [shouting]
- Easy, easy.

287
00:15:35,975 --> 00:15:38,444
Hold on!

288
00:15:38,511 --> 00:15:40,613
All right, all right, come on.

289
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,282
Okay, take the rope off!

290
00:15:42,348 --> 00:15:45,385
Wait, wait.

291
00:15:45,451 --> 00:15:48,121
We all gotta go. Go, go, go, go!

292
00:15:48,187 --> 00:15:49,555
Get him up!

293
00:15:53,192 --> 00:15:54,827
[shouting]

294
00:15:59,032 --> 00:16:01,868
- You guys okay?
- Yes.

295
00:16:08,007 --> 00:16:10,610
Yes, see, if you look right here,

296
00:16:10,677 --> 00:16:13,880
that's one of the spots.

297
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,218
Stay still.

298
00:16:19,285 --> 00:16:21,120
What are you even doing here?

299
00:16:21,187 --> 00:16:23,323
I mean, what happened to saving the planet, Em?

300
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:26,392
- You're not trying.
- Stop! This is not the time.

301
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:29,228
This fault line hasn't seen this much activity in over 100 years.

302
00:16:29,295 --> 00:16:32,965
The Geologic Society reported a mass sediment shift

303
00:16:33,032 --> 00:16:35,635
due to the rising temperatures in the riverbed.

304
00:16:35,702 --> 00:16:37,303
I'm sorry, hold on a second.

305
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,907
Who is this guy and why do you know so much about this?

306
00:16:40,973 --> 00:16:42,175
I'm Dan Eames.

307
00:16:42,241 --> 00:16:43,576
Dan Eames?

308
00:16:43,643 --> 00:16:47,146
You led a study along the San Andreas fault?

309
00:16:47,213 --> 00:16:48,548
So nice to finally meet you.

310
00:16:48,614 --> 00:16:50,817
Wait, are you Dr. Cami Weddle?

311
00:16:50,883 --> 00:16:52,185
Yeah.

312
00:16:52,251 --> 00:16:54,087
The pleasure is all mine. I know all about your work.

313
00:16:54,153 --> 00:16:57,990
They asked me to come check on this because of all the concern.

314
00:17:06,065 --> 00:17:07,867
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

315
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:10,470
Carla, these thermal readings on the fault

316
00:17:10,536 --> 00:17:11,804
are at an all-time high.

317
00:17:11,871 --> 00:17:13,506
Well, the fault's locked and loaded.

318
00:17:13,573 --> 00:17:15,308
No, it's not that.

319
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,809
The most recent subterranean scan shows

320
00:17:16,876 --> 00:17:19,579
the strike-slip portion as being a double lock.

321
00:17:19,645 --> 00:17:21,114
If the tension breaks,

322
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,650
it'll create a magnitude eight or greater.

323
00:17:24,717 --> 00:17:27,186
And then that'll transfer all that tension...

324
00:17:27,253 --> 00:17:28,955
We need to call Cami right now.

325
00:17:29,021 --> 00:17:30,656
The sinkholes we're seeing are through

326
00:17:30,723 --> 00:17:32,024
a dense layer of igneous rock.

327
00:17:32,091 --> 00:17:33,526
Igneous?

328
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:34,927
See, you're saying that some igneous layers

329
00:17:34,994 --> 00:17:36,396
are turned upward?

330
00:17:36,462 --> 00:17:37,663
Yes.

331
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,132
I haven't figured out why.

332
00:17:39,198 --> 00:17:41,501
[phone rings]

333
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:45,138
Hey, Finn. Eric's fine. So is Brenda.

334
00:17:45,204 --> 00:17:47,607
We're almost there. This couldn't wait.

335
00:17:47,673 --> 00:17:49,041
What is the latest reading showing?

336
00:17:49,108 --> 00:17:51,210
Based on your algorithm, if the fault slips today,

337
00:17:51,277 --> 00:17:53,579
it's guaranteed to produce an 8.0 or higher.

338
00:17:53,646 --> 00:17:55,014
Are you sure?

339
00:17:55,081 --> 00:17:56,616
Yeah, I've double and triple checked it.

340
00:17:56,682 --> 00:17:58,451
We've got to get Governor Barber on board.

341
00:17:58,518 --> 00:18:00,353
Cami, it's not just that.

342
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,288
When the quake hits, it's going to transfer that pressure

343
00:18:02,355 --> 00:18:03,823
to a second strike point.

344
00:18:06,192 --> 00:18:07,527
Are you seeing this?

345
00:18:07,593 --> 00:18:08,895
The satellite imagery is showing buckling

346
00:18:08,961 --> 00:18:11,063
that happened in the past 24 hours.

347
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,734
The entire fault line is radically altering the terrain.

348
00:18:14,801 --> 00:18:16,436
Finn, we're seeing massive swells.

349
00:18:16,502 --> 00:18:17,737
It'll reach the Gulf of Mexico.

350
00:18:17,804 --> 00:18:19,906
When it transfers to the second stage,

351
00:18:19,972 --> 00:18:21,407
it'll only be nine hours until...

352
00:18:21,474 --> 00:18:23,576
Until it produces a 10.0 or larger.

353
00:18:23,643 --> 00:18:24,811
That's right.

354
00:18:26,946 --> 00:18:29,916
Okay. Let's meet up later and we'll figure it out.

355
00:18:29,982 --> 00:18:31,617
Sounds good.

356
00:18:31,684 --> 00:18:33,619
Alan, I don't think I'll be getting

357
00:18:33,686 --> 00:18:35,087
to the survey of your site today.

358
00:18:35,154 --> 00:18:36,589
That's great.

359
00:18:36,656 --> 00:18:38,724
That's all based on a guess, right?

360
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,259
Don't worry about it. I got it.

361
00:18:40,326 --> 00:18:42,328
- I'll do it all myself, okay?
- A guess? Really?

362
00:18:42,395 --> 00:18:43,596
Finn just ran the algorithm.

363
00:18:43,663 --> 00:18:44,964
It indicates if we don't pinpoint

364
00:18:45,031 --> 00:18:46,833
where and how these plates are slipping,

365
00:18:46,899 --> 00:18:50,736
we're looking at a 10.0 or larger in less than nine hours.

366
00:18:50,803 --> 00:18:52,939
Wait a minute, a 10.0?

367
00:18:53,005 --> 00:18:54,307
Are you serious?

368
00:18:54,373 --> 00:18:56,442
That'll break the whole country in half.

369
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:58,845
I just pulled up the Missouri Seismic Emergency Database

370
00:18:58,911 --> 00:19:00,980
- to compare it to ours.
- Wait, wait.

371
00:19:01,047 --> 00:19:02,548
Scroll down.

372
00:19:02,615 --> 00:19:05,718
Why are the aftershocks bigger than the originating quake?

373
00:19:07,487 --> 00:19:10,490
The 6.8 is most likely a foreshock.

374
00:19:10,556 --> 00:19:13,359
Why would you assume that it's going to get worse?

375
00:19:13,426 --> 00:19:15,828
Because even though we've had multiple large quakes,

376
00:19:15,895 --> 00:19:18,264
the total heat energy hasn't completely dissipated.

377
00:19:19,665 --> 00:19:21,801
We need to let Governor Barber know.

378
00:19:21,868 --> 00:19:24,437
Yeah, I need to call her ASAP.

379
00:19:24,504 --> 00:19:26,639
We need a multi-agency response.

380
00:19:26,706 --> 00:19:27,940
Can you get us in touch?

381
00:19:28,007 --> 00:19:29,175
Your pals, otherwise she wouldn't

382
00:19:29,242 --> 00:19:30,510
have approved of your fracking sites.

383
00:19:30,576 --> 00:19:32,512
What's the end game here, Cami?

384
00:19:32,578 --> 00:19:34,447
A natural emergency declaration?

385
00:19:34,514 --> 00:19:35,481
Are we going to do that again?

386
00:19:35,548 --> 00:19:37,116
Yes, exactly.

387
00:19:37,183 --> 00:19:38,718
Then the military can work with us

388
00:19:38,784 --> 00:19:40,286
on a strategy to mitigate the actual quake.

389
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:44,090
Otherwise, every city in the Midwest will be leveled.

390
00:19:44,156 --> 00:19:45,958
Millions will die.

391
00:19:46,025 --> 00:19:47,994
I've got to get the governor on the line.

392
00:20:00,106 --> 00:20:02,275
The series of quakes is severe for the area,

393
00:20:02,341 --> 00:20:03,976
but not impossible.

394
00:20:04,043 --> 00:20:06,212
Nothing the National Guard and FEMA can't manage.

395
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:07,980
Should I write up a preliminary report,

396
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:10,283
get it ready for release, just in case?

397
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:13,452
Fine, but no leaks. And for God's sakes, no press.

398
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:15,555
The last thing we need is another panic situation

399
00:20:15,621 --> 00:20:16,622
on our hands.

400
00:20:16,689 --> 00:20:17,657
[phone vibrates]

401
00:20:17,723 --> 00:20:19,358
That's Dr. Cami Weddle.

402
00:20:19,425 --> 00:20:20,927
You should join me.

403
00:20:23,062 --> 00:20:26,299
Dr. Weddle, Governor Barber. Brett Rothers from SEMA is here.

404
00:20:26,365 --> 00:20:27,700
You're on speaker.

405
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:29,101
The geothermal activity in New Madrid

406
00:20:29,168 --> 00:20:30,836
has only increased after the quakes.

407
00:20:30,903 --> 00:20:33,739
By not releasing kinetic energy, it's only

408
00:20:33,806 --> 00:20:35,708
storing that much more potential energy.

409
00:20:35,775 --> 00:20:39,178
Don't you think that's a bit premature?

410
00:20:39,245 --> 00:20:41,380
You're suggesting an imminent mega-casualty event.

411
00:20:41,447 --> 00:20:42,915
It's not a suggestion.

412
00:20:42,982 --> 00:20:46,485
It'll be a 10.0 or greater in less than nine hours.

413
00:20:46,552 --> 00:20:49,789
Brett, have you seen the data from the orbital network yet?

414
00:20:49,855 --> 00:20:52,024
Yes, but the images don't have enough detail

415
00:20:52,091 --> 00:20:54,327
or data to make such a prediction.

416
00:20:54,393 --> 00:20:56,762
A man was swallowed up by the Mississippi.

417
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:59,265
I nearly lost my son and a colleague by a fissure

418
00:20:59,332 --> 00:21:01,400
that wasn't here this morning and this was just the beginning.

419
00:21:01,467 --> 00:21:03,869
We need to prep emergency services and the military

420
00:21:03,936 --> 00:21:06,272
and start citizen evacuations.

421
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:08,708
Two years ago, you thought the big one was coming.

422
00:21:08,774 --> 00:21:11,577
It did not, causing a mass panic

423
00:21:11,644 --> 00:21:14,914
that took us days to recover from.

424
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:17,283
I'm assembling a team headed by Mr. Rothers.

425
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,751
I'd like you to join in.

426
00:21:18,818 --> 00:21:21,887
All I'm asking is that you prepare an evac plan

427
00:21:21,954 --> 00:21:23,456
for at least New Madrid County.

428
00:21:23,522 --> 00:21:27,693
The safety of families is very important to us.

429
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,797
You don't know that New Madrid indicates a larger event.

430
00:21:31,864 --> 00:21:34,300
My predictive models don't lie.

431
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:36,769
It will strike New Madrid in nine hours.

432
00:21:39,572 --> 00:21:41,874
Is Alan there?

433
00:21:41,941 --> 00:21:43,976
What does he have to do with this?

434
00:21:44,043 --> 00:21:46,212
You understand our apprehension.

435
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:48,014
If we know that Alan is on your side...

436
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,016
Call me when you're ready to listen.

437
00:21:52,585 --> 00:21:53,919
There.

438
00:21:53,986 --> 00:21:57,056
You see how stupid the government is, right?

439
00:21:57,923 --> 00:21:59,058
You think they're right.

440
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,530
I think that you can't do it without their help.

441
00:22:04,597 --> 00:22:06,766
I need you with me.

442
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,335
Your fracking business represents

443
00:22:09,402 --> 00:22:11,504
jobs and re-elections.

444
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:13,706
They'll listen to you.

445
00:22:13,773 --> 00:22:18,611
Cami, you realize that you're asking me to cry wolf.

446
00:22:18,678 --> 00:22:21,247
For me, not for us this time.

447
00:22:22,548 --> 00:22:24,517
You know my position on this.

448
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:26,052
Dad, come on.

449
00:22:26,118 --> 00:22:28,254
Mom's literally been working on this her whole life.

450
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,657
Predicting earthquakes and maybe stopping them.

451
00:22:31,724 --> 00:22:32,758
I know, but...

452
00:22:32,825 --> 00:22:34,226
I know, I've heard it before.

453
00:22:34,293 --> 00:22:37,096
You can't stop an earthquake, right, Cami?

454
00:22:37,163 --> 00:22:39,031
But our focus right now is urging the government

455
00:22:39,098 --> 00:22:42,535
to get people to safety.

456
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:43,936
Finn's here with the mobile lab.

457
00:22:44,003 --> 00:22:45,471
We don't have time to argue.

458
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:47,206
Are you in or are you out?

459
00:22:47,273 --> 00:22:48,741
Come on, at least come to the lab,

460
00:22:48,808 --> 00:22:51,010
see what she's been working on.

461
00:22:51,077 --> 00:22:52,178
Please?

462
00:22:55,715 --> 00:23:00,152
All right, all right, I'll come check it out, okay?

463
00:23:00,219 --> 00:23:01,520
Dan, if you'd like to come along,

464
00:23:01,587 --> 00:23:02,688
I'd love your input as well.

465
00:23:02,755 --> 00:23:03,956
Sure, whatever I can do.

466
00:23:05,057 --> 00:23:06,192
All right, let's go.

467
00:23:06,258 --> 00:23:07,493
All right, see you guys in a little bit.

468
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,527
[rumbling]

469
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,065
I suggest a compromise that won't interfere

470
00:23:13,132 --> 00:23:15,735
with Dr. Weddle's work.

471
00:23:15,801 --> 00:23:17,503
She might be willing to cooperate.

472
00:23:18,904 --> 00:23:21,107
That fracking field brought in millions

473
00:23:21,173 --> 00:23:23,375
over the past 18 months. Understand?

474
00:23:23,442 --> 00:23:25,878
Yes, of course.

475
00:23:25,945 --> 00:23:27,613
Let me reach out.

476
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,449
No, we can still attempt compromise

477
00:23:30,516 --> 00:23:32,384
while making our position clear.

478
00:23:32,451 --> 00:23:34,019
Go meet her.

479
00:23:34,086 --> 00:23:35,488
We'll fly your equipment in.

480
00:23:36,856 --> 00:23:38,390
Okay.

481
00:23:41,193 --> 00:23:43,329
- You guys got this, right?
- Yeah, we're good.

482
00:23:43,395 --> 00:23:45,131
Connect these to this and you're good.

483
00:24:01,814 --> 00:24:03,516
What?

484
00:24:05,951 --> 00:24:07,620
I don't know.

485
00:24:07,686 --> 00:24:08,821
You ever miss this?

486
00:24:09,722 --> 00:24:11,023
I never stopped doing it.

487
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:15,961
No, I mean, I mean this.

488
00:24:19,231 --> 00:24:20,833
You mean us working together?

489
00:24:26,272 --> 00:24:30,176
Look, we were doing incredible work together.

490
00:24:30,242 --> 00:24:33,579
We were a good team. We were helping each other.

491
00:24:33,646 --> 00:24:35,581
Yeah, we were.

492
00:24:35,648 --> 00:24:37,449
You gave that up. Not me.

493
00:24:38,884 --> 00:24:40,686
You wanted a different life.

494
00:24:40,753 --> 00:24:42,454
You said so yourself.

495
00:24:44,356 --> 00:24:49,461
Look, I thought I was doing what was right

496
00:24:49,528 --> 00:24:52,464
for the kids, for us.

497
00:24:52,531 --> 00:24:55,034
Yeah, but you gave up what was most important to us.

498
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,303
Protecting people.

499
00:25:02,842 --> 00:25:04,877
Make sure the antenna's straight.

500
00:25:09,348 --> 00:25:11,150
Man, this is quite the setup.

501
00:25:11,217 --> 00:25:12,251
I've heard all about Cami's work,

502
00:25:12,318 --> 00:25:13,853
but you say this is updated.

503
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,389
Yeah, we can predict earthquakes and pinpoint the epicenter.

504
00:25:17,456 --> 00:25:18,591
We call it SEEPS,

505
00:25:18,657 --> 00:25:21,627
our Smart Early Earthquake Prediction System.

506
00:25:21,694 --> 00:25:23,162
Huh.

507
00:25:23,229 --> 00:25:25,865
Three sensors allow us to triangulate the epicenter.

508
00:25:25,931 --> 00:25:27,366
Attach a stake to the bottom,

509
00:25:27,433 --> 00:25:30,202
stick it in the ground, and you are golden.

510
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:32,271
Or you can always attach it to a tripod

511
00:25:32,338 --> 00:25:33,906
if you don't have any soft ground.

512
00:25:33,973 --> 00:25:35,941
And they all communicate with one another.

513
00:25:36,008 --> 00:25:40,412
Yeah, yeah, the tectonic AI I developed is state of the art.

514
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:44,149
Actually, I just finished writing the manual last week.

515
00:25:45,384 --> 00:25:47,186
Yeah, we can predict earthquakes, minutes,

516
00:25:47,253 --> 00:25:48,787
sometimes even hours ahead of time.

517
00:25:48,854 --> 00:25:51,190
And with the sensors, we're able to triangulate

518
00:25:51,257 --> 00:25:53,058
the epicenter itself.

519
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:55,227
Wow, this is amazing.

520
00:25:55,294 --> 00:25:57,196
This will save lives.

521
00:25:57,263 --> 00:25:59,231
That's the plan.

522
00:25:59,298 --> 00:26:01,367
- [phone rings]
- Oh, I gotta take this call.

523
00:26:01,433 --> 00:26:03,469
Yeah.

524
00:26:03,535 --> 00:26:07,206
So this is real data from the field from yesterday.

525
00:26:07,273 --> 00:26:08,374
Mm-hmm.

526
00:26:10,209 --> 00:26:14,013
Take a look at the timestamp on my simulation.

527
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:15,614
It's 10 minutes ahead of the quake.

528
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,118
10 minutes?

529
00:26:19,184 --> 00:26:21,620
- Cami, that's huge.
- I know.

530
00:26:21,687 --> 00:26:23,522
Oh, man.

531
00:26:43,943 --> 00:26:45,077
[alarm blaring]

532
00:26:47,646 --> 00:26:48,681
That's not good.

533
00:26:48,747 --> 00:26:50,149
Cami!

534
00:26:50,215 --> 00:26:52,318
DAN: I know. We'll meet in Minneapolis, okay?

535
00:26:52,384 --> 00:26:53,585
Just grab what you need from the house.

536
00:26:53,652 --> 00:26:54,820
Did you hear that?

537
00:26:54,887 --> 00:26:56,789
Yeah, the origin of the new quake is near Marston,

538
00:26:56,855 --> 00:26:57,790
about 8 miles to the south.

539
00:26:57,856 --> 00:26:59,258
Yeah.

540
00:26:59,325 --> 00:27:00,392
Isn't that where your new fracking site is?

541
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:02,061
Yeah, we gotta secure the site.

542
00:27:02,127 --> 00:27:03,629
Oh, so you believe her now that your facility's on the line?

543
00:27:03,696 --> 00:27:05,497
No, I believe her because she's got proof.

544
00:27:05,564 --> 00:27:07,599
And I'm trying to help fix this thing.

545
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:09,234
Cam, look at this.

546
00:27:09,301 --> 00:27:10,703
It's at 8%.

547
00:27:10,769 --> 00:27:11,837
Get the diameter.

548
00:27:11,904 --> 00:27:15,674
Hang on, hang on...

549
00:27:15,741 --> 00:27:17,242
[rumbling]

550
00:27:21,447 --> 00:27:23,115
[shouting]

551
00:27:23,182 --> 00:27:24,283
Is that a sinkhole?

552
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,151
It's a collapse.

553
00:27:27,086 --> 00:27:28,754
Go, go, go!

554
00:27:47,806 --> 00:27:49,441
Dr. Weddle, I just wanted to say...

555
00:27:49,508 --> 00:27:53,278
Dr. Rothers, Finn Holly, Dr. Weddle is a colleague.

556
00:27:53,345 --> 00:27:55,047
She's confirming data at the moment,

557
00:27:55,114 --> 00:27:56,582
so she asked me to speak to you.

558
00:27:56,648 --> 00:27:58,017
Do you see now?

559
00:27:58,083 --> 00:27:59,485
We can't even meet on solid ground

560
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:01,453
because it's literally shifting under our feet.

561
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,590
Fine. Get your sensors set up and calibrated with ours.

562
00:28:04,656 --> 00:28:06,625
We'll use your system as a backup.

563
00:28:06,692 --> 00:28:09,161
I'll even give you access to one of our helicopters.

564
00:28:09,228 --> 00:28:12,031
No, Alan's got a helicopter in Marston.

565
00:28:12,097 --> 00:28:13,565
We're using his helipad.

566
00:28:13,632 --> 00:28:15,000
That's where we're headed now.

567
00:28:15,067 --> 00:28:16,902
Cami suggested you meet us there.

568
00:28:16,969 --> 00:28:19,705
To do what? Compare data?

569
00:28:19,772 --> 00:28:21,340
Of course, Governor Barber will want to confer

570
00:28:21,407 --> 00:28:22,841
once we've reached an agreement.

571
00:28:22,908 --> 00:28:25,344
The quakes are centered from the south, near Marston.

572
00:28:25,411 --> 00:28:28,680
Cami, Alan, and I have all confirmed the data.

573
00:28:28,747 --> 00:28:29,982
Marston?

574
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:31,617
My sensor indicates differently.

575
00:28:31,683 --> 00:28:34,420
Smart Earthquake Detection Unit or SEDU

576
00:28:34,486 --> 00:28:35,788
predicts quakes within minutes.

577
00:28:35,854 --> 00:28:38,991
Pinpoint accuracy at a radius of six miles.

578
00:28:39,058 --> 00:28:40,692
You stole Cami's tech.

579
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:42,327
The one sensor design could do everything

580
00:28:42,394 --> 00:28:44,163
your three sensors can, but faster.

581
00:28:44,229 --> 00:28:49,001
It placed the fault's leading epicenter in Sikeston, Missouri.

582
00:28:49,068 --> 00:28:50,202
A single sensor?

583
00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:51,703
You need three to triangulate.

584
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,972
Brett, we're supposed to be working together.

585
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:56,875
Just like you should have done when you and Cami were at SEMA.

586
00:28:56,942 --> 00:28:58,310
We need to do something.

587
00:28:58,377 --> 00:29:00,012
We are doing something.

588
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:02,047
We have the ordnance payload.

589
00:29:02,114 --> 00:29:03,916
Relieve the stress along the fault

590
00:29:03,982 --> 00:29:06,718
akin to a single GBU-39B.

591
00:29:06,785 --> 00:29:08,287
Small but mighty.

592
00:29:08,353 --> 00:29:10,355
We'll confirm the weak spot or a hole,

593
00:29:10,422 --> 00:29:14,026
clear the civilians within 20 miles, and boom.

594
00:29:14,093 --> 00:29:15,994
A bomb? No!

595
00:29:16,061 --> 00:29:19,164
For that to work, you would need to know the exact epicenter.

596
00:29:19,231 --> 00:29:20,232
It's safer to use

597
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:22,668
multiple precise timed explosions

598
00:29:22,734 --> 00:29:25,104
all along the fault if we're going to relieve the stress.

599
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:27,272
One location just isn't feasible.

600
00:29:27,339 --> 00:29:29,141
You're putting millions of lives at risk.

601
00:29:29,208 --> 00:29:30,275
It's not safe.

602
00:29:30,342 --> 00:29:31,677
It is safe and efficient.

603
00:29:31,743 --> 00:29:35,214
- One blast.
- The epicenter is in Marston.

604
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,183
Your sensor is sending you to the wrong spot.

605
00:29:41,954 --> 00:29:43,489
Brett! Hello?

606
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:49,995
He's not going to help us.

607
00:29:50,062 --> 00:29:51,597
We're on our own.

608
00:30:00,105 --> 00:30:03,308
We need to get as far ahead of Brett time-wise as possible.

609
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:05,077
Did you get in touch with Colonel Silas?

610
00:30:05,144 --> 00:30:06,645
Still on hold.

611
00:30:06,712 --> 00:30:08,080
Me, too.

612
00:30:08,147 --> 00:30:10,949
I can't get through to any Missouri congressperson.

613
00:30:11,016 --> 00:30:12,518
[phone rings]

614
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,289
Hello, you're through to Senator Paulson's office.

615
00:30:17,356 --> 00:30:19,124
I'm sorry for the hold, but I'm sure you understand

616
00:30:19,191 --> 00:30:21,260
we're inundated from the events of today.

617
00:30:21,326 --> 00:30:22,794
Ma'am, this is Dr. Cami Weddle.

618
00:30:22,861 --> 00:30:24,196
There's been a major seismic event.

619
00:30:24,263 --> 00:30:25,430
We're aware.

620
00:30:25,497 --> 00:30:26,899
All representatives received

621
00:30:26,965 --> 00:30:28,834
state-related briefs from SEMA and USGS.

622
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:30,435
You don't understand.

623
00:30:30,502 --> 00:30:33,138
Your concerns will be forwarded to Senator Paulson.

624
00:30:33,205 --> 00:30:34,139
Thank you.

625
00:30:34,206 --> 00:30:37,176
[disconnect tone]

626
00:30:37,242 --> 00:30:38,310
Any luck?

627
00:30:38,377 --> 00:30:40,045
They just hung up.

628
00:30:40,112 --> 00:30:41,680
Six hours till the fault snaps.

629
00:30:41,747 --> 00:30:43,482
You should call the governor and have her

630
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:44,850
issue a national emergency.

631
00:30:46,418 --> 00:30:47,753
Alan's right.

632
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:49,521
If no one issues it, we've got to stop this.

633
00:30:49,588 --> 00:30:51,023
How are we looking?

634
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:52,624
Created the triangulation.

635
00:30:52,691 --> 00:30:54,159
We need to get to the exact epicenter.

636
00:30:54,226 --> 00:30:56,495
Memphis, Nashville, and St. Louis.

637
00:30:56,562 --> 00:30:58,997
- I'll head to St. Louis.
- Okay.

638
00:30:59,064 --> 00:31:00,766
Okay, this is very important to get the placement right.

639
00:31:00,832 --> 00:31:02,834
It's got to be five to ten feet above the ground

640
00:31:02,901 --> 00:31:05,037
and find the exact epicenter to relieve stress on the fault.

641
00:31:05,103 --> 00:31:07,506
Yeah, if we get there ahead of their planned detonation.

642
00:31:07,573 --> 00:31:09,408
We've got to get this sensor up and running

643
00:31:09,474 --> 00:31:11,376
or it won't matter what we do next.

644
00:31:11,443 --> 00:31:12,711
Okay, it's do or die.

645
00:31:12,778 --> 00:31:14,046
Now let's get this packed up.

646
00:31:14,112 --> 00:31:15,547
I'll go with Carla.

647
00:31:15,614 --> 00:31:17,950
Okay, Dan and Brenda, you take Nashville.

648
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:20,652
That leaves Memphis. Alan and I will go.

649
00:31:22,721 --> 00:31:24,790
Finn, you stay and man the base camp at the lab.

650
00:31:24,856 --> 00:31:26,725
There's no one else I would trust to do it.

651
00:31:26,792 --> 00:31:29,161
Sure.

652
00:31:29,228 --> 00:31:31,096
Definitely more at home in front of the computer

653
00:31:31,163 --> 00:31:32,531
than on the front lines anyway.

654
00:31:32,598 --> 00:31:33,966
I know.

655
00:31:34,032 --> 00:31:35,934
Sometimes you've got to do what you need to,

656
00:31:36,001 --> 00:31:36,969
not what you want to.

657
00:31:39,504 --> 00:31:40,639
You're right.

658
00:31:42,374 --> 00:31:44,343
Hey, while you're in the air you can text me your thoughts

659
00:31:44,409 --> 00:31:45,944
on the color palette for the wedding.

660
00:31:48,413 --> 00:31:50,616
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

661
00:31:50,682 --> 00:31:52,184
Promise me you'll be safe.

662
00:31:52,251 --> 00:31:53,385
I'll do my best.

663
00:31:55,887 --> 00:31:58,523
All right, get the sensors put up and then check in.

664
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:01,727
Finn will let you know if it's transferred.

665
00:32:01,793 --> 00:32:04,129
Hey, be careful.

666
00:32:04,196 --> 00:32:05,664
Both of you.

667
00:32:05,731 --> 00:32:06,965
We will.

668
00:32:07,032 --> 00:32:07,966
I love you.

669
00:32:08,033 --> 00:32:09,601
I love you too, mom.

670
00:32:12,371 --> 00:32:14,239
What are we supposed to do about this?

671
00:32:14,306 --> 00:32:15,974
I mean, I don't know what to do about it, do you?

672
00:32:31,156 --> 00:32:32,357
We'll set up down there.

673
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:45,937
Is the tripod gonna hold?

674
00:32:46,004 --> 00:32:47,873
It's weighted, but make sure it's balanced.

675
00:32:52,544 --> 00:32:53,812
- I'll need the wires.
- Yep.

676
00:32:59,084 --> 00:33:00,752
It's not blinking.

677
00:33:10,696 --> 00:33:13,298
Guys, we've got an earthquake incoming

678
00:33:13,365 --> 00:33:14,533
in T minus five minutes.

679
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:16,168
Get to the helo. Now.

680
00:33:16,234 --> 00:33:17,369
But it's not set up yet.

681
00:33:17,436 --> 00:33:18,537
I got it, go.

682
00:33:18,603 --> 00:33:20,172
Are you sure?

683
00:33:20,238 --> 00:33:22,007
- It's already leaving.
- I'll be right behind you.

684
00:33:22,074 --> 00:33:23,542
- No.
- You see that warning, Karla?

685
00:33:23,608 --> 00:33:26,111
Yeah. Emily and Eric are heading back up to help.

686
00:33:26,178 --> 00:33:27,112
I'm almost done.

687
00:33:37,122 --> 00:33:38,357
Finn, are you linked?

688
00:33:38,423 --> 00:33:40,192
The links good! Great job, Karla!

689
00:33:40,258 --> 00:33:42,127
[rumbling]

690
00:33:42,194 --> 00:33:44,463
No, it's too soon.

691
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:48,867
Emily? Eric?

692
00:33:57,609 --> 00:33:59,010
This is unbelievable.

693
00:34:01,747 --> 00:34:04,149
We need to fly faster.

694
00:34:04,216 --> 00:34:05,884
Brett's gonna go through with his bomb

695
00:34:05,951 --> 00:34:07,586
if we don't get those sensors operational ASAP.

696
00:34:07,652 --> 00:34:09,154
Flying as fast as I can, right?

697
00:34:09,221 --> 00:34:11,690
I'm doing 120 knots at ground speed.

698
00:34:17,396 --> 00:34:19,698
You really think that all this is from fracking?

699
00:34:22,401 --> 00:34:24,403
Put me on Bluetooth.

700
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:26,638
Yeah, I'll click you over.

701
00:34:26,705 --> 00:34:28,240
I'm gonna call the kids again.

702
00:34:28,306 --> 00:34:30,442
They never called me back after that quake in St. Louis.

703
00:34:30,509 --> 00:34:31,910
[phone ringing]

704
00:34:49,294 --> 00:34:51,463
[coughing]

705
00:34:55,967 --> 00:34:57,002
Eric?

706
00:34:58,236 --> 00:34:59,538
Eric?

707
00:34:59,604 --> 00:35:01,873
Eric!

708
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,376
Eric? Eric?

709
00:35:04,443 --> 00:35:05,544
Eric? Eric, wake up. Are you okay?

710
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,446
Eric?

711
00:35:07,512 --> 00:35:09,581
Eric! Can you move?

712
00:35:09,648 --> 00:35:11,016
Are you okay?

713
00:35:13,618 --> 00:35:15,320
Can you move?

714
00:35:15,387 --> 00:35:16,922
Liz...

715
00:35:16,988 --> 00:35:18,089
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

716
00:35:18,156 --> 00:35:19,724
- What is it?
- It's my leg!

717
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:20,926
It's my leg, it's caught on something.

718
00:35:26,164 --> 00:35:28,500
- I can't move, I can't move.
- Emily?

719
00:35:28,567 --> 00:35:30,235
- Karla?
- Eric?

720
00:35:30,302 --> 00:35:31,803
Karla, we're over here!

721
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:32,871
Karla!

722
00:35:33,805 --> 00:35:35,307
Karla, it's Eric!

723
00:35:35,373 --> 00:35:37,309
Are you okay?

724
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:39,411
Oh my God. We need to lift.

725
00:35:39,478 --> 00:35:42,247
- Okay, ready?
- Yeah, yeah, go.

726
00:35:42,314 --> 00:35:44,216
[grunting]

727
00:35:44,282 --> 00:35:45,584
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

728
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,719
We need some leverage.

729
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,889
Use this pole.

730
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,526
I'm gonna lift. You're gonna pull him out.

731
00:35:54,593 --> 00:35:57,996
Okay, on three. Ready?

732
00:35:58,063 --> 00:36:00,432
One, two, three.

733
00:36:00,499 --> 00:36:02,133
[screaming]

734
00:36:06,004 --> 00:36:09,074
Again. Okay, ready?

735
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,976
One, two, three.

736
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:13,645
[grunting]

737
00:36:19,551 --> 00:36:20,986
[panting]

738
00:36:34,533 --> 00:36:36,535
Wait, wait, wait. The tablet.

739
00:36:36,601 --> 00:36:37,969
You guys go.

740
00:36:38,036 --> 00:36:39,738
- Get him out of here, go.
- Forget the tablet!

741
00:36:39,804 --> 00:36:41,306
- Karla! Karla!
- Karla!

742
00:36:41,373 --> 00:36:42,941
- Karla!
- Karla, watch out!

743
00:36:43,008 --> 00:36:45,110
[screams]

744
00:36:45,176 --> 00:36:46,177
Karla, no!

745
00:36:49,581 --> 00:36:51,116
Come on.

746
00:36:51,182 --> 00:36:52,851
It's all right, I'm sure they're fine.

747
00:36:52,918 --> 00:36:54,953
You don't know that.

748
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,288
How can you not be worried about your own kids?

749
00:36:56,354 --> 00:36:58,657
I'm worried about my kids, okay?

750
00:36:58,723 --> 00:37:00,292
But ruminating over the worst case scenario

751
00:37:00,358 --> 00:37:02,694
isn't going to help anybody right now.

752
00:37:04,296 --> 00:37:06,264
FINN: Cami?

753
00:37:06,331 --> 00:37:08,633
Finn, hey.

754
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,402
Cami? Alan? You guys hear me?

755
00:37:10,468 --> 00:37:11,703
Yes, we're here.

756
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,004
Please tell me you talked to the kids.

757
00:37:13,071 --> 00:37:15,874
Just heard the first sensor's up.

758
00:37:15,941 --> 00:37:17,776
There was some trouble, though.

759
00:37:20,111 --> 00:37:21,580
Uh...

760
00:37:21,646 --> 00:37:24,783
Are Eric and Emily okay?

761
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:26,918
Please, Finn, please, you got to talk.

762
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:32,023
Finn, let us know what's going on.

763
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,125
Yeah, Emily and Eric are fine.

764
00:37:34,192 --> 00:37:36,361
They're in the helicopter now, but uh...

765
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:43,768
Karla, she, uh...

766
00:37:47,005 --> 00:37:48,306
She didn't make it.

767
00:37:57,315 --> 00:37:59,818
The building collapsed when they were setting up the sensor.

768
00:38:04,856 --> 00:38:06,257
Have you heard from Brenda and Dan?

769
00:38:08,326 --> 00:38:10,095
Yeah, uh...

770
00:38:10,161 --> 00:38:11,663
They were in their helicopter on the way to Nashville

771
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,431
when the quake hit.

772
00:38:13,498 --> 00:38:15,266
They're safe and still en route.

773
00:38:17,669 --> 00:38:18,870
Let me know if you hear anything else.

774
00:38:18,937 --> 00:38:20,105
Over and out.

775
00:38:29,714 --> 00:38:31,750
I'm really sorry.

776
00:38:31,816 --> 00:38:33,685
Sorry about Karla, I know.

777
00:38:34,986 --> 00:38:37,589
She was like family to you.

778
00:38:37,656 --> 00:38:39,791
I never should have let them go out on that helo.

779
00:38:39,858 --> 00:38:40,892
Eric was right, it was too dangerous.

780
00:38:40,959 --> 00:38:42,093
I should have gone instead.

781
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,029
- Carla would...
- Stop, okay?

782
00:38:44,095 --> 00:38:46,064
There's nothing you could have done.

783
00:38:46,131 --> 00:38:49,934
They're adults now. They make their own choices.

784
00:38:50,001 --> 00:38:51,803
Nothing you could have done.

785
00:38:54,339 --> 00:38:56,141
You should have been there for them more.

786
00:38:57,509 --> 00:38:59,144
Now we can never get that time back and...

787
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:01,212
We could all be dead tomorrow.

788
00:39:01,279 --> 00:39:05,316
Cami, I was trying to make a life for us.

789
00:39:05,383 --> 00:39:06,851
You prioritized work.

790
00:39:06,918 --> 00:39:08,586
You disappeared.

791
00:39:08,653 --> 00:39:11,956
I thought that I was doing the right thing for you

792
00:39:12,023 --> 00:39:13,958
and for Emily and for Eric.

793
00:39:14,025 --> 00:39:16,895
By getting in good with the governor?

794
00:39:16,961 --> 00:39:19,030
How much money did you put into her campaign?

795
00:39:19,097 --> 00:39:20,765
Money that should have been given to your kids.

796
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:25,470
I thought that I was trying to create a future for us, Cami.

797
00:39:25,537 --> 00:39:27,972
Even if we stop this quake?

798
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:29,441
If you keep fracking the planet,

799
00:39:29,507 --> 00:39:31,242
none of us are going to have a future left at all.

800
00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:33,278
Okay, all right. You know what? Stop. Stop.

801
00:39:33,344 --> 00:39:35,080
I am done with this already, okay?

802
00:39:35,146 --> 00:39:37,816
I'm not arguing about this anymore.

803
00:39:37,882 --> 00:39:39,250
And you know what?

804
00:39:39,317 --> 00:39:40,485
I don't know what you're complaining about.

805
00:39:40,552 --> 00:39:41,753
You got everything you wanted.

806
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,921
You got the house, you got the kids,

807
00:39:42,987 --> 00:39:44,155
you got the lab, everything, Cami.

808
00:39:44,222 --> 00:39:45,557
- Almost everything.
- Everything!

809
00:39:45,623 --> 00:39:46,958
Almost everything.

810
00:39:47,025 --> 00:39:50,662
I just kept hoping that you would come home.

811
00:39:50,729 --> 00:39:52,430
Or maybe even just call.

812
00:39:59,637 --> 00:40:01,005
I'm sorry, okay?

813
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,275
I just thought that...

814
00:40:06,511 --> 00:40:09,214
I thought a clean break would be the best thing for us.

815
00:40:13,485 --> 00:40:14,786
I'm sorry, okay?

816
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:32,337
Look out!

817
00:40:32,403 --> 00:40:33,404
Whoa!

818
00:40:35,607 --> 00:40:38,610
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on.

819
00:40:38,676 --> 00:40:39,944
We're going down, we're going down.

820
00:40:40,011 --> 00:40:42,147
I don't have control.

821
00:40:42,213 --> 00:40:44,115
Hold on, brace yourself, ready?

822
00:40:46,284 --> 00:40:47,886
[crash]

823
00:40:54,626 --> 00:40:55,960
We're at the Capitol, Mom.

824
00:40:56,027 --> 00:40:58,129
Yeah, I know, but we're out of options.

825
00:40:58,196 --> 00:41:00,865
I have to get through to the governor somehow, for Karla.

826
00:41:02,066 --> 00:41:03,568
Yeah, yeah, we'll be safe.

827
00:41:03,635 --> 00:41:04,869
Okay, I love you, bye.

828
00:41:04,936 --> 00:41:07,272
I can assure you, I have a team of experts

829
00:41:07,338 --> 00:41:09,374
in New Madrid surveying the damage

830
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,476
and gathering information that will be all available

831
00:41:11,543 --> 00:41:12,710
to you shortly.

832
00:41:12,777 --> 00:41:15,513
We have been told that these are normal quakes,

833
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,915
nothing to be worried about.

834
00:41:16,981 --> 00:41:18,583
That's not true. No, that's not true.

835
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,251
That's not the truth. She's lying to you.

836
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:21,519
I'm Dr. Cami Weddle's daughter...

837
00:41:21,586 --> 00:41:23,188
Who we fired last year.

838
00:41:23,254 --> 00:41:24,422
And I've seen all the information that they gathered.

839
00:41:24,489 --> 00:41:27,158
Today, a massive quake is imminent.

840
00:41:27,225 --> 00:41:28,626
They're out there right now trying to set up

841
00:41:28,693 --> 00:41:30,962
the last of three sensors to try to triangulate

842
00:41:31,029 --> 00:41:32,797
where the epicenter of the fault will be.

843
00:41:32,864 --> 00:41:35,366
We need a military response to strike at the quake

844
00:41:35,433 --> 00:41:37,335
and to try and disperse this energy.

845
00:41:37,402 --> 00:41:39,137
- You have to listen to me.
- Nonsense.

846
00:41:39,204 --> 00:41:41,906
Look, the governor is minimizing just how serious this is.

847
00:41:41,973 --> 00:41:43,608
It's just like climate change.

848
00:41:43,675 --> 00:41:45,343
As we speak, they're clearing sites

849
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:47,078
so that they can drop a bomb into the fault

850
00:41:47,145 --> 00:41:48,413
and destroy the entire area.

851
00:41:48,479 --> 00:41:50,315
But what these idiots don't realize

852
00:41:50,381 --> 00:41:51,816
is they're bombing the wrong spot.

853
00:41:51,883 --> 00:41:53,418
- Wake up!
- She's lying to you!

854
00:41:53,484 --> 00:41:55,687
- It's life or death!
- No!

855
00:41:55,753 --> 00:41:56,988
Come on, this way, this way.

856
00:41:57,055 --> 00:41:59,390
- We have data...
- Don't listen to her!

857
00:41:59,457 --> 00:42:01,960
We have data from legitimate sources at SEMA,

858
00:42:02,026 --> 00:42:04,295
which is our state seismic agency

859
00:42:04,362 --> 00:42:07,098
that the situation is normal.

860
00:42:07,165 --> 00:42:08,933
It is headed by Dr. Brett Rothers,

861
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,236
who is highly respected here in Missouri.

862
00:42:11,302 --> 00:42:13,504
He is not bought and paid for,

863
00:42:13,571 --> 00:42:16,474
if you'll excuse some honesty, by the people in Washington.

864
00:42:16,541 --> 00:42:20,245
He is one of us, and he cares about the people of Missouri.

865
00:42:20,311 --> 00:42:23,948
Not the Weddle's, not some special interest.

866
00:42:24,015 --> 00:42:26,818
That's all for now. Thank you.

Get your boys, assemble that bore-driller here.

00:43:15,066 --> 00:43:16,968
Yes, sir. You heard the man.

00:43:17,035 --> 00:43:18,469
Let's get it moving. Sir, yes, sir.

885
00:43:18,536 --> 00:43:21,539
All right, I want it up and running in 30 minutes!

886
00:43:23,308 --> 00:43:25,710
It looks like the sensor in St. Louis is up and running,

887
00:43:25,777 --> 00:43:27,912
but we won't be able to triangulate the epicenter

888
00:43:27,979 --> 00:43:30,715
unless all three are transmitting at the same time.

889
00:43:30,782 --> 00:43:32,417
There. All set.

890
00:43:32,483 --> 00:43:33,451
I'll let Cami know we're ready to go

once we get to the helicopter.

Okay.

All right, sensors in place.

- No.

Let's get out of here before it gets worse.

902

If we don't get that sensor before the sinkhole expands,

903
00:44:10,922 --> 00:44:12,523
we'll never find the exact pressure point on the fault.

989
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,870
There you go.

990
00:48:52,937 --> 00:48:55,406
Don't forget the head. The head of the sensor.

991
00:48:55,473 --> 00:48:56,407
I got you.

992
00:48:56,474 --> 00:48:57,908
[rumbling]

993
00:48:59,277 --> 00:49:00,511
Ah!

994
00:49:09,954 --> 00:49:11,322
All right.

995
00:49:11,389 --> 00:49:12,957
[grunting]

996
00:49:15,192 --> 00:49:16,460
I'm not going to let go.

997
00:49:16,527 --> 00:49:18,596
[grunting]

998
00:49:20,398 --> 00:49:21,966
Ah!

999
00:49:24,368 --> 00:49:25,803
Ooh...

1000
00:49:33,411 --> 00:49:35,613
[grunting]

1001
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,149
- Take my hand.
- All right, fine, help me up.

1002
00:49:38,215 --> 00:49:39,350
[grunting]

1003
00:49:41,952 --> 00:49:43,054
[panting]

1004
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:50,194
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1005
00:49:50,261 --> 00:49:52,163
You sure?

1006
00:49:52,229 --> 00:49:54,365
I'm gonna...

1007
00:49:54,432 --> 00:49:55,633
I'm going to get in touch with the kids.

1008
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,001
Let them know we're on our way.

1009
00:49:57,068 --> 00:49:59,170
Yeah, yeah. Let me grab this stuff. Here.

1010
00:49:59,236 --> 00:50:01,172
I'll take that heavy stuff.

1011
00:50:01,238 --> 00:50:03,407
I got it.

1012
00:50:03,474 --> 00:50:04,842
She's got it. She always got it.

1013
00:50:10,181 --> 00:50:11,482
Move it, people.

1014
00:50:11,549 --> 00:50:13,050
We've got to change this bit fast.

1015
00:50:14,452 --> 00:50:15,986
We got it as deep as we could go.

1016
00:50:16,053 --> 00:50:18,155
We could keep drilling, but we need to replace the bit.

1017
00:50:18,222 --> 00:50:19,623
It's going to take some time.

1018
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:21,125
How far is it now?

1019
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,662
We pushed as fast as we could go.

1020
00:50:24,729 --> 00:50:27,098
Maybe 1,000 feet, give or take.

1021
00:50:27,164 --> 00:50:28,599
It'll have to do.

1022
00:50:28,666 --> 00:50:30,301
Prep the drop line, get the bomb attached.

1023
00:50:30,368 --> 00:50:32,703
We're running out of time. We have to move on this now.

1024
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:34,605
You don't get it right the first time,

1025
00:50:34,672 --> 00:50:36,440
we won't get another chance.

1026
00:50:38,075 --> 00:50:39,643
Let's get it right then.

1027
00:50:41,946 --> 00:50:44,315
I'm working from the best data that I've got.

1028
00:50:44,382 --> 00:50:46,083
We'll give it our best shot

1029
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:48,119
and hope they were close enough to have the desired effect

1030
00:50:48,185 --> 00:50:50,721
we need to stop these quakes.

1031
00:50:50,788 --> 00:50:54,158
Let's prep the bomb, follow orders.

1032
00:50:54,225 --> 00:50:56,360
Are you sure we're far enough underground

1033
00:50:56,427 --> 00:50:58,195
that we won't decimate the city?

1034
00:50:58,262 --> 00:51:00,030
Yeah, it'll just feel like another earthquake to them.

1035
00:51:00,097 --> 00:51:02,099
What do we do with those other warheads?

1036
00:51:03,868 --> 00:51:05,903
Put on the helo and be ready to go.

1037
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:07,972
Get everyone packed up and ready to move.

1038
00:51:08,038 --> 00:51:09,940
We're out of here as soon as that bomb is in place.

1039
00:51:10,007 --> 00:51:11,075
Yes, sir.

1040
00:51:11,142 --> 00:51:12,576
You heard the man, let's get packing.

1041
00:51:12,643 --> 00:51:13,944
[whistles]

1042
00:51:14,011 --> 00:51:16,847
Move it, move it, let's get going, people.

1043
00:51:23,254 --> 00:51:24,522
Dan, good news.

1044
00:51:24,588 --> 00:51:25,923
All three sensors are up and running.

1045
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:28,626
Just waiting on the last one to sync up now.

1046
00:51:31,729 --> 00:51:33,431
What's wrong?

1047
00:51:33,497 --> 00:51:35,633
I couldn't get to her.

1048
00:51:35,699 --> 00:51:37,835
I couldn't save her.

1049
00:51:41,405 --> 00:51:42,540
Brenda...

1050
00:51:47,044 --> 00:51:48,212
She's gone.

1051
00:51:50,181 --> 00:51:51,749
What?

1052
00:51:57,455 --> 00:52:00,424
Why didn't you tell us?

1053
00:52:00,491 --> 00:52:04,061
She would have wanted us to make sure we got this right.

1054
00:52:04,128 --> 00:52:06,163
She wouldn't have wanted us to waste time

1055
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:07,531
feeling sorry for her.

1056
00:52:07,598 --> 00:52:08,866
You know Brenda.

1057
00:52:19,143 --> 00:52:20,578
You're right.

1058
00:52:25,716 --> 00:52:29,753
Hey, we need to stop this quake.

1059
00:52:32,189 --> 00:52:34,024
For Brenda.

1060
00:52:34,091 --> 00:52:35,593
And Karla.

1061
00:52:40,764 --> 00:52:43,000
[alarm sounding]

1062
00:52:45,769 --> 00:52:47,238
Is it working?

1063
00:52:47,304 --> 00:52:48,539
The software isn't designed to handle this much

1064
00:52:48,606 --> 00:52:50,508
incoming data at once.

1065
00:52:50,574 --> 00:52:53,344
It's going to overwhelm the central hub.

1066
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:54,645
Gah!

1067
00:52:54,712 --> 00:52:55,713
We've got to get the power back on.

1068
00:52:55,779 --> 00:52:57,147
Yeah, I know.

1069
00:52:57,214 --> 00:52:58,582
All right, without the calibrated sensor locations

1070
00:52:58,649 --> 00:52:59,917
were screwed.

1071
00:53:05,723 --> 00:53:07,391
I got nothing. Um...

1072
00:53:07,458 --> 00:53:09,059
Okay, stay on radio.

1073
00:53:09,126 --> 00:53:11,462
I'm going to go in the hanger and flip the main breaker.

1074
00:53:11,529 --> 00:53:14,131
Once the lab powers back on, turn on any of these monitors

1075
00:53:14,198 --> 00:53:16,233
and systems that doesn't come on automatically.

1076
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,835
- Got it?
- On it.

1077
00:53:19,537 --> 00:53:20,938
[alarm blaring]

1078
00:53:28,445 --> 00:53:29,914
What's going on?

1079
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:32,716
Yeah, I'm working on it. Okay, just give me a second.

1080
00:53:38,489 --> 00:53:39,623
This is...

1081
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:41,058
[grunting]

1082
00:53:46,497 --> 00:53:49,033
DAN: It's not working.

1083
00:53:49,099 --> 00:53:50,267
Almost there.

1084
00:53:50,334 --> 00:53:53,070
- Try again.
- All right, I'm almost there.

1085
00:53:54,672 --> 00:53:56,507
[grunts]

1086
00:53:56,574 --> 00:53:58,242
[powering on]

1087
00:53:58,309 --> 00:53:59,243
It's on.

1088
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:01,045
Great. I'm heading back now.

1089
00:54:09,219 --> 00:54:11,922
They said they'd be here by now.

1090
00:54:11,989 --> 00:54:13,691
- You don't think that...
- Don't even think it.

1091
00:54:13,757 --> 00:54:16,360
They said they're fine and they're coming when they can.

1092
00:54:25,903 --> 00:54:27,304
I've got the monitors back on.

1093
00:54:27,371 --> 00:54:28,339
Great.

1094
00:54:29,773 --> 00:54:31,542
Come on, come on.

1095
00:54:31,609 --> 00:54:32,943
Oh, thank God.

1096
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:34,678
It's still here. We have the info.

1097
00:54:34,745 --> 00:54:35,980
What does this say?

1098
00:54:36,046 --> 00:54:37,681
Wait...

1099
00:54:37,748 --> 00:54:40,050
Brett and his team are in the wrong spot.

1100
00:54:40,117 --> 00:54:42,519
They need to be in New Madrid, not Sikeston.

1101
00:54:42,586 --> 00:54:45,089
That's where the epicenter is according to Cami's sensors.

1102
00:54:45,155 --> 00:54:47,124
That red, those are the areas of impact?

1103
00:54:47,191 --> 00:54:49,493
Yeah. The quakes are spreading.

1104
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:52,062
Are you sure? Maybe we just need to run them again.

1105
00:54:52,129 --> 00:54:53,664
Yes, I have. All right?

1106
00:54:53,731 --> 00:54:56,300
Look, all these areas along the Mississippi,

1107
00:54:56,367 --> 00:54:57,735
those are flood zones.

1108
00:54:57,801 --> 00:55:00,337
With the recent storms, that water level is at a max, okay?

1109
00:55:00,404 --> 00:55:02,906
When this thing hits, all that water is going to spill over.

1110
00:55:02,973 --> 00:55:05,776
New Madrid, the Midwest, all underwater.

1111
00:55:05,843 --> 00:55:08,445
Maybe even the entire country.

1112
00:55:14,852 --> 00:55:16,020
You're lucky.

1113
00:55:16,086 --> 00:55:17,054
They wanted to throw you on a jail cell

1114
00:55:17,121 --> 00:55:18,555
until this all blows over.

1115
00:55:18,622 --> 00:55:20,090
Blows over? Are you kidding me?

1116
00:55:20,157 --> 00:55:22,226
- It's getting worse.
- We're doing all we can.

1117
00:55:22,292 --> 00:55:23,594
It's not enough.

1118
00:55:23,661 --> 00:55:24,928
You need to evacuate the state

1119
00:55:24,995 --> 00:55:27,164
and declare a state of emergency.

1120
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:30,000
Do you realize the trouble you caused me back there?

1121
00:55:30,067 --> 00:55:32,136
I've got the press on my back now.

1122
00:55:32,202 --> 00:55:33,771
You're just like your mom

1123
00:55:33,837 --> 00:55:35,105
once you sink your teeth into something.

1124
00:55:35,172 --> 00:55:37,007
Millions of lives are at stake.

1125
00:55:37,074 --> 00:55:38,742
We almost died out there cleaning up your mess.

1126
00:55:38,809 --> 00:55:41,045
And when the next one hits, it's going to be even worse.

1127
00:55:41,111 --> 00:55:42,613
And the next one and the one after that.

1128
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,082
So what are you going to do about it, Governor? Huh?

1129
00:55:45,149 --> 00:55:47,084
Your mother caused a massive panic

1130
00:55:47,151 --> 00:55:49,386
the last time we had a series of quake events.

1131
00:55:49,453 --> 00:55:52,356
The DOJ will have my hide

1132
00:55:52,423 --> 00:55:54,491
if we are not 100% positive about this.

1133
00:55:54,558 --> 00:55:57,961
I cannot declare a state of emergency on a hunch.

1134
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:01,865
So for the good people of this great state,

1135
00:56:01,932 --> 00:56:04,668
I will not have a redo of that episode.

1136
00:56:04,735 --> 00:56:06,070
We want the same thing.

1137
00:56:06,136 --> 00:56:08,472
We're on the same side, more than you know.

1138
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:10,074
Are you kidding me?

1139
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:11,642
We don't want the same thing.

1140
00:56:11,709 --> 00:56:14,344
You got your politics, your contracts, your kickbacks.

1141
00:56:14,411 --> 00:56:16,580
We don't have time for this right now.

1142
00:56:16,647 --> 00:56:18,248
Why didn't you use my mom's data?

1143
00:56:18,315 --> 00:56:20,017
It's way more reliable than Brett's.

1144
00:56:20,084 --> 00:56:24,188
Emily, the tech Brett has that he developed for SEMA

1145
00:56:24,254 --> 00:56:25,989
is much, much more advanced than your mother's.

1146
00:56:26,056 --> 00:56:27,524
But it hasn't been peer reviewed.

1147
00:56:27,591 --> 00:56:29,426
It's literally just Brett's work, right?

1148
00:56:29,493 --> 00:56:32,029
Which was developed and based off

1149
00:56:32,096 --> 00:56:34,364
of my mother's research and development.

1150
00:56:34,431 --> 00:56:35,933
Tell me I'm wrong.

1151
00:56:35,999 --> 00:56:37,468
We have a difference of opinion.

1152
00:56:37,534 --> 00:56:40,938
No, you omitted crucial data, my mother's data.

1153
00:56:41,004 --> 00:56:42,005
That's not a difference of opinion.

1154
00:56:42,072 --> 00:56:43,540
That's a difference of reality.

1155
00:56:43,607 --> 00:56:45,476
It just sounds to me like you're more concerned

1156
00:56:45,542 --> 00:56:48,045
with staying relevant than saving lives.

1157
00:56:50,481 --> 00:56:52,716
[rumbling]

1158
00:56:52,783 --> 00:56:56,186
[distant shouting]

1159
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:05,329
Look, just tell them the truth.

1160
00:57:05,395 --> 00:57:06,730
My mom's right. The quakes are getting bigger

1161
00:57:06,797 --> 00:57:08,065
every single time they hit.

1162
00:57:08,132 --> 00:57:09,566
Just do the right thing.

1163
00:57:09,633 --> 00:57:12,302
Or their deaths are going to be on your hands.

1164
00:57:12,369 --> 00:57:15,572
[phone buzzes]

1165
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:18,108
Governor Barber.

1166
00:57:18,175 --> 00:57:20,110
Alan and Dr. Weddle are here?

1167
00:57:22,012 --> 00:57:23,313
Send them to my office.

1168
00:57:40,397 --> 00:57:43,433
- Mom!
- Thank God you're okay.

1169
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:44,668
You all right?

1170
00:57:44,735 --> 00:57:47,471
Hi. Welcome.

1171
00:57:47,538 --> 00:57:48,672
I just spoke with Finn.

1172
00:57:48,739 --> 00:57:50,274
He confirmed we've triangulated the data

1173
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:52,242
and linked up with Brett's system.

1174
00:57:52,309 --> 00:57:53,911
Yeah, found the epicenter's weak spot.

1175
00:57:53,977 --> 00:57:55,345
It's a wide area.

1176
00:57:55,412 --> 00:57:57,047
We're still honing in on the exact site,

1177
00:57:57,114 --> 00:57:58,649
but it's somewhere south of New Madrid,

1178
00:57:58,715 --> 00:57:59,917
near the fracking sites.

1179
00:57:59,983 --> 00:58:02,219
Not in Sikeston, like Brett thought.

1180
00:58:02,286 --> 00:58:04,688
How sure are you of this?

1181
00:58:04,755 --> 00:58:07,291
This earthquake will rip apart the entire continent.

1182
00:58:07,357 --> 00:58:09,760
And the flooding will destroy what's left of middle America,

1183
00:58:09,827 --> 00:58:11,528
maybe even the entire country.

1184
00:58:11,595 --> 00:58:13,797
We have to stop this quake.

1185
00:58:13,864 --> 00:58:15,899
And you're sure you can stop it?

1186
00:58:15,966 --> 00:58:17,467
Yes.

1187
00:58:17,534 --> 00:58:20,237
We have to stop that warhead at Sikeston.

1188
00:58:20,304 --> 00:58:22,272
I tried to reach out to Brett, but no luck.

1189
00:58:22,339 --> 00:58:24,074
This could blow up in our face.

1190
00:58:24,141 --> 00:58:25,843
Are you okay with this?

1191
00:58:25,909 --> 00:58:28,445
Am I okay with it? It doesn't matter if I'm okay with it.

1192
00:58:28,512 --> 00:58:29,446
The tech's solid.

1193
00:58:29,513 --> 00:58:30,914
And there's more.

1194
00:58:32,282 --> 00:58:34,051
Aside from the quakes growing in strength,

1195
00:58:34,117 --> 00:58:36,386
the data is showing that it's rapidly building.

1196
00:58:36,453 --> 00:58:38,655
And it's hitting at specific time intervals.

1197
00:58:38,722 --> 00:58:40,023
Meaning?

1198
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:42,292
The big one we told you about?

1199
00:58:42,359 --> 00:58:44,228
You can expect it in a few hours.

1200
00:58:46,964 --> 00:58:50,234
If you're wrong about this, I will lock you up myself.

1201
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:53,103
This is not a charity for people's pet theories.

1202
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:54,738
Pet theories?

1203
00:58:54,805 --> 00:58:56,940
We have a state to protect, a society that has to keep going.

1204
00:58:57,007 --> 00:58:58,642
Do you understand that?

1205
00:58:58,709 --> 00:58:59,843
Sure.

1206
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:01,111
All right, I see what this is about.

1207
00:59:01,178 --> 00:59:03,046
See, for me, it's about human lives.

1208
00:59:03,113 --> 00:59:04,915
And that means sticking out your neck.

1209
00:59:05,782 --> 00:59:07,150
[rumbling]

1210
00:59:09,453 --> 00:59:10,754
Wait...

1211
00:59:10,821 --> 00:59:14,124
Get under the table now! Go! Go!

1212
00:59:14,191 --> 00:59:15,225
- Go, go, go, go!
- Take cover!

1213
00:59:15,292 --> 00:59:16,627
- Hurry!
- Get under the table!

1214
00:59:16,693 --> 00:59:17,661
Get under the table!

1215
00:59:24,401 --> 00:59:26,770
Mom, make it stop! Make it stop!

1216
00:59:26,837 --> 00:59:29,106
It's okay, it's okay.

1217
00:59:37,814 --> 00:59:39,216
I think it's over.

1218
00:59:39,283 --> 00:59:40,984
Mom, was that the big one?

1219
00:59:41,051 --> 00:59:43,620
No, no. That must have been a 7.4.

1220
00:59:43,687 --> 00:59:47,257
The big one is predicted to be at least 10.0.

1221
00:59:47,324 --> 00:59:48,992
That was a short 7.4.

1222
00:59:49,059 --> 00:59:50,294
That was short?

1223
00:59:52,095 --> 00:59:54,898
All right, come on, you guys.

1224
00:59:54,965 --> 00:59:56,466
I got you.

1225
00:59:57,834 --> 00:59:58,835
You all right?

1226
00:59:58,902 --> 01:00:02,439
Wow, that was heavy.

1227
01:00:02,506 --> 01:00:04,241
Oh, my God.

1228
01:00:05,208 --> 01:00:07,010
Oh, my God.

1229
01:00:07,077 --> 01:00:08,712
It's over.

1230
01:00:08,779 --> 01:00:10,180
This is all my fault.

1231
01:00:12,516 --> 01:00:14,017
Oh, my God.

1232
01:00:20,223 --> 01:00:23,527
If that's a 7.4, what's a 9.7?

1233
01:00:36,573 --> 01:00:38,175
Now you see why we need all the people

1234
01:00:38,241 --> 01:00:40,143
in the immediate vicinity evacuated.

1235
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:42,679
Multi-leveled buildings cleared.

1236
01:00:42,746 --> 01:00:44,982
We need a traffic lockdown to keep the cars

1237
01:00:45,048 --> 01:00:47,351
off of the highways and the bridges.

1238
01:00:47,417 --> 01:00:48,719
Okay.

1239
01:00:48,785 --> 01:00:51,688
Get Brett on the phone. We've got to stop this.

1240
01:00:51,755 --> 01:00:53,056
We're the point team now. Understood?

1241
01:00:53,123 --> 01:00:55,192
Understood.

1242
01:00:55,258 --> 01:00:57,427
Have Brett meet us in New Madrid.

1243
01:00:57,494 --> 01:00:59,463
I'll relay that information ASAP.

1244
01:00:59,529 --> 01:01:00,998
Thanks.

1245
01:01:01,064 --> 01:01:02,599
Dr. Weddle... Cami...

1246
01:01:02,666 --> 01:01:06,703
just please get down there and stop this anyway you can.

1247
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:08,171
I'll do the best I can.

1248
01:01:30,927 --> 01:01:32,596
Alan, get Brett on the line.

1249
01:01:32,662 --> 01:01:34,931
Eric and Emily, get the climbing gear

1250
01:01:34,998 --> 01:01:36,867
from my car to the helicopter. We're going to need it.

1251
01:01:36,933 --> 01:01:38,168
Okay.

1252
01:01:38,235 --> 01:01:39,436
I'm gonna update Finn. Be back in five.

1253
01:01:40,704 --> 01:01:43,340
Hey, we're back. How's it going?

1254
01:01:43,407 --> 01:01:45,075
Glad you're okay.

1255
01:01:45,142 --> 01:01:46,109
You, too.

1256
01:01:46,176 --> 01:01:47,110
How was New Madrid?

1257
01:01:47,177 --> 01:01:48,712
- Hey, Dan?
- Yeah.

1258
01:01:48,779 --> 01:01:50,380
Can you give us a sec?

1259
01:01:51,681 --> 01:01:53,483
Sure.

1260
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:55,085
Thanks.

1261
01:01:56,653 --> 01:01:58,021
Senator Paulson can't take your call.

1262
01:01:58,088 --> 01:01:59,890
Straight to voicemail.

1263
01:01:59,956 --> 01:02:03,827
Going to voicemail. I'll try the land line.

1264
01:02:03,894 --> 01:02:05,862
I think the tower's out or something.

1265
01:02:07,064 --> 01:02:08,498
What's up?

1266
01:02:13,136 --> 01:02:15,205
[sighs] I can't do this right now.

1267
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:19,242
It's been almost a year since you and Alan separated.

1268
01:02:19,309 --> 01:02:20,844
We have a catastrophe on our hands.

1269
01:02:20,911 --> 01:02:22,946
You want to do this?

1270
01:02:23,013 --> 01:02:25,649
I think we rushed into things.

1271
01:02:27,951 --> 01:02:32,956
I think a lot of things are happening way too fast.

1272
01:02:33,023 --> 01:02:34,858
Finn, it's...

1273
01:02:34,925 --> 01:02:36,259
Look...

1274
01:02:36,326 --> 01:02:40,297
This type of environment, it's not for me.

1275
01:02:41,698 --> 01:02:45,669
The system overloaded and the entire lab shut down.

1276
01:02:45,735 --> 01:02:48,972
You know, millions of people could have died

1277
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:51,808
because I didn't account for one little thing.

1278
01:02:54,544 --> 01:02:56,713
And I heard the two of you on the radio.

1279
01:02:59,549 --> 01:03:01,818
You guys are built for this kind of pressure.

1280
01:03:05,255 --> 01:03:06,456
Not me.

1281
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:12,829
And I can't ask you to give that up.

1282
01:03:14,965 --> 01:03:17,634
This is your life's work.

1283
01:03:19,102 --> 01:03:20,770
It's complicated.

1284
01:03:23,373 --> 01:03:24,875
Then I'll make it simple.

1285
01:03:26,543 --> 01:03:30,747
I will stay here and hold down base camp for you guys.

1286
01:03:32,149 --> 01:03:34,518
I'm here until the end.

1287
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:37,921
This is my home, too,

1288
01:03:37,988 --> 01:03:41,791
and I will do whatever I can to protect it.

1289
01:03:44,227 --> 01:03:45,695
But once this is all over...

1290
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,801
I'm going back to Jefferson City.

1291
01:03:55,705 --> 01:03:58,642
Maybe finally get that job in government.

1292
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:03,647
It seems like they could use a computer scientist

1293
01:04:03,713 --> 01:04:05,415
who actually knows what they're doing.

1294
01:04:08,919 --> 01:04:10,420
Maybe slow down for a bit.

1295
01:04:13,757 --> 01:04:15,892
I'm going to miss you around here.

1296
01:04:15,959 --> 01:04:18,195
Yeah.

1297
01:04:18,261 --> 01:04:20,230
I'm going to miss you, too.

1298
01:04:28,939 --> 01:04:30,774
Come on, keep it going. Hurry it up.

1299
01:04:34,477 --> 01:04:35,812
[phone rings]

1300
01:04:40,951 --> 01:04:41,851
Go for Brett.

1301
01:04:41,918 --> 01:04:43,720
Hey, hey, Brett, what's going on?

1302
01:04:43,787 --> 01:04:45,589
Hey, it's Alan Weddle right now.

1303
01:04:45,655 --> 01:04:47,057
I need you to talk to Cami about something. Cami?

1304
01:04:47,123 --> 01:04:48,858
Cami, I got him on the phone. Come on out.

1305
01:04:54,331 --> 01:04:56,233
Governor Barber ordered you to stop.

1306
01:04:56,299 --> 01:04:59,002
We're getting ready to drop the payload into borehole.

1307
01:04:59,069 --> 01:05:01,771
The epicenter will be at New Madrid, not Sikeston.

1308
01:05:01,838 --> 01:05:04,107
You we're wrong last time.

1309
01:05:04,174 --> 01:05:06,009
How can you be sure you're not wrong now?

1310
01:05:06,076 --> 01:05:08,979
If you detonate that bomb, it'll set off a chain reaction

1311
01:05:09,045 --> 01:05:10,914
of quakes we can't come back from.

1312
01:05:10,981 --> 01:05:13,550
That last quake convinced me we have to make a decision.

1313
01:05:13,617 --> 01:05:16,853
Sometimes it comes down to a best guess.

1314
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,322
You're playing with people's lives.

1315
01:05:19,389 --> 01:05:20,991
We are sticking with the original plan

1316
01:05:21,057 --> 01:05:22,692
before the activity worsens.

1317
01:05:22,759 --> 01:05:25,662
You said it yourself, we have to do this now or it won't work.

1318
01:05:25,729 --> 01:05:27,964
If you blow up the wrong place, it won't work at all.

1319
01:05:33,503 --> 01:05:36,640
My information is reliable and it's the best we've got.

1320
01:05:37,507 --> 01:05:38,942
Over and out.

1321
01:05:44,281 --> 01:05:45,315
Ugh!

1322
01:05:45,382 --> 01:05:46,549
He's going to get us all killed.

1323
01:05:46,616 --> 01:05:48,184
We have to do something.

1324
01:05:48,251 --> 01:05:50,420
We've got this, we're going to do something, okay?

1325
01:05:50,487 --> 01:05:52,289
What if I'm wrong? What if I'm wrong again?

1326
01:05:52,355 --> 01:05:53,423
Hey, stop that.

1327
01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:55,792
Okay, you're not wrong, okay?

1328
01:05:55,859 --> 01:05:58,261
Trust yourself. Believe in yourself.

1329
01:05:58,328 --> 01:05:59,696
You got this.

1330
01:05:59,763 --> 01:06:01,865
Fine but I can't have any mistakes right now.

1331
01:06:01,931 --> 01:06:02,866
Come on.

1332
01:06:02,932 --> 01:06:04,634
Get those ropes into the helicopter.

1333
01:06:09,105 --> 01:06:11,908
Pull up Brett's tech specs and ours into a side-by-side.

1334
01:06:13,343 --> 01:06:14,944
Just like last time, right?

1335
01:06:15,011 --> 01:06:17,180
- Boost the signal.
- Yeah, I did.

1336
01:06:17,247 --> 01:06:18,214
Same results.

1337
01:06:18,281 --> 01:06:19,716
But now that the sensors are up,

1338
01:06:19,783 --> 01:06:21,318
we should have a couple minutes heads up

1339
01:06:21,384 --> 01:06:22,819
before the next quake hits.

1340
01:06:22,886 --> 01:06:24,154
Wait.

1341
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:27,524
It is at the fracking site in Marston, not Sikeston.

1342
01:06:27,590 --> 01:06:29,125
The quake's coming in 56 minutes.

1343
01:06:29,192 --> 01:06:31,661
Regardless, we should cross-check the data with Brett.

1344
01:06:31,728 --> 01:06:32,896
You should call him.

1345
01:06:32,962 --> 01:06:34,564
Wait a minute, you guys are seeing

1346
01:06:34,631 --> 01:06:36,066
the predictive data right here?

1347
01:06:36,132 --> 01:06:37,667
When Brett detonates that bomb,

1348
01:06:37,734 --> 01:06:39,869
it's going to trigger an 8.6 quake

1349
01:06:39,936 --> 01:06:41,304
that's going to cause a kickback

1350
01:06:41,371 --> 01:06:43,273
that'll basically reset the plates

1351
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:44,641
but at a higher intensity.

1352
01:06:44,708 --> 01:06:46,309
What will that trigger?

1353
01:06:46,376 --> 01:06:47,977
A 10.6.

1354
01:06:48,044 --> 01:06:51,481
It's in the same time frame but 100 times the intensity.

1355
01:06:51,548 --> 01:06:54,584
It'll split the entire continent in half.

1356
01:06:55,985 --> 01:06:59,222
We've got to get to Marston and stop Brett.

1357
01:06:59,289 --> 01:07:01,091
I don't think the mobile lab can take it.

1358
01:07:01,157 --> 01:07:02,425
Everybody outside.

1359
01:07:02,492 --> 01:07:03,927
I'll back up the data.

1360
01:07:08,531 --> 01:07:10,166
[phone rings]

1361
01:07:20,777 --> 01:07:22,078
That's enough! That's enough!

1362
01:07:22,145 --> 01:07:24,381
Stop!

1363
01:07:24,447 --> 01:07:26,015
Get back to Jefferson city.

1364
01:07:26,082 --> 01:07:27,817
Yes, sir.

1365
01:07:34,491 --> 01:07:36,059
Let's get her in the air.

1366
01:07:36,126 --> 01:07:37,527
You got it!

1367
01:07:49,773 --> 01:07:52,742
Aaron, let me know when everyone's clear.

1368
01:07:59,182 --> 01:08:01,017
We need to move now.

1369
01:08:05,955 --> 01:08:08,158
Get everyone out now, Aaron.

1370
01:08:09,626 --> 01:08:11,060
Copy that.

1371
01:08:11,127 --> 01:08:12,495
Yes, we've pulled them back 50 miles.

1372
01:08:12,562 --> 01:08:14,631
I'm beginning detonation process.

1373
01:08:16,966 --> 01:08:21,371
Three, two, one.

1374
01:08:21,438 --> 01:08:22,372
[beeps]

1375
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:23,740
[explosion]

1376
01:08:27,243 --> 01:08:28,578
What's going on?

1377
01:08:34,517 --> 01:08:36,853
Sir, it didn't reset the plates.

1378
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:38,788
It triggered a magnitude 8.6!

1379
01:08:38,855 --> 01:08:40,323
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1380
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:43,626
No! Dammit!

1381
01:08:43,693 --> 01:08:45,462
It's splitting apart the Mississippi River!

1382
01:08:45,528 --> 01:08:48,565
Massive flooding is inbound from here to St. Louis.

1383
01:08:51,468 --> 01:08:52,735
[rumbling]

1384
01:08:52,802 --> 01:08:54,504
Under the table, now!

1385
01:08:54,571 --> 01:08:56,473
We have an 8.6 occurring now.

1386
01:08:56,539 --> 01:08:57,907
Was that Brett?

1387
01:09:01,177 --> 01:09:03,813
We've just received word that a magnitude 8.6 earthquake

1388
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,615
has occurred in eastern Missouri.

1389
01:09:05,682 --> 01:09:07,851
The last quake, a 7.4, left the capital

1390
01:09:07,917 --> 01:09:09,986
Jefferson City heavily damaged.

1391
01:09:10,053 --> 01:09:11,488
Reports of massive flooding along

1392
01:09:11,554 --> 01:09:12,856
the Mississippi have been reported,

1393
01:09:12,922 --> 01:09:14,624
which may send tsunami-like waves

1394
01:09:14,691 --> 01:09:15,925
as far north as St. Louis.

1395
01:09:15,992 --> 01:09:17,994
The death toll is estimated to be

1396
01:09:18,061 --> 01:09:19,696
in the thousands and rising.

1397
01:09:23,933 --> 01:09:25,235
Mission is a failure, sir.

1398
01:09:25,301 --> 01:09:27,604
The blast didn't reset the fault.

1399
01:09:27,670 --> 01:09:30,006
It just increased the intensity.

1400
01:09:30,073 --> 01:09:32,876
The next quake will be a 10.0 or higher.

1401
01:09:32,942 --> 01:09:34,711
No word yet from Governor Barber

1402
01:09:34,777 --> 01:09:37,814
if this 8.6 with part of the state's earthquake mediation.

1403
01:09:42,585 --> 01:09:43,786
Brett.

1404
01:09:43,853 --> 01:09:45,154
What happened out there?

1405
01:09:45,221 --> 01:09:48,525
Governor Barber, we need to start evacs now.

1406
01:09:48,591 --> 01:09:50,260
Right now.

1407
01:09:50,326 --> 01:09:53,630
I need casualties. Collateral damage.

1408
01:09:53,696 --> 01:09:56,866
Everything's gone.

1409
01:09:56,933 --> 01:09:58,535
It's all gone.

1410
01:09:58,601 --> 01:09:59,936
Shoulda listened to Weddle.

1411
01:10:02,739 --> 01:10:04,941
We need to evacuate the state.

1412
01:10:05,008 --> 01:10:07,277
- Now.
- It's too late, Brett.

1413
01:10:07,343 --> 01:10:10,213
This is a complete institutional failure.

1414
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:14,884
We have a magnitude of 10 or greater imminent.

1415
01:10:14,951 --> 01:10:18,154
Find Cami! And do whatever you can to fix this.

1416
01:10:22,825 --> 01:10:24,327
Sir, what do we do now?

1417
01:10:24,394 --> 01:10:26,930
We have floodwaters approaching our location.

1418
01:10:29,766 --> 01:10:32,035
Sir? Sir! Ah!

1419
01:10:35,238 --> 01:10:37,273
Okay... okay.

1420
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:38,274
Okay.

1421
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:41,778
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1422
01:10:41,844 --> 01:10:44,147
[screaming]

1423
01:10:45,715 --> 01:10:47,183
You okay?

1424
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:49,986
- Fire up the helo.
- All right, I got it. I got it.

1425
01:10:50,053 --> 01:10:52,555
We gotta go. Follow your dad. Now.

1426
01:10:52,622 --> 01:10:55,325
No, no!

1427
01:10:55,391 --> 01:10:56,793
Go.

1428
01:10:56,859 --> 01:10:58,328
Go, go, go.

1429
01:10:58,394 --> 01:10:59,629
Mom, Mom, no, no, no.

1430
01:10:59,696 --> 01:11:01,464
- You have to come.
- No.

1431
01:11:01,531 --> 01:11:02,665
Mom!

1432
01:11:10,073 --> 01:11:11,374
Oh, wow.

1433
01:11:11,441 --> 01:11:14,243
Let's go, guys. We gotta go. We gotta go.

1434

Hey, come on. We gotta go.

1437
01:11:42,939 --> 01:11:44,273
Tell her we gotta go.

1438
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:46,309
Mom!

1439
01:11:46,376 --> 01:11:49,112
Come on. You have to go! Mom, come on.

1440
01:11:52,949 --> 01:11:55,284
Guys, we gotta go now. Now, come on.

1441
01:11:55,351 --> 01:11:57,420
Backed up the data.

Whoa!

- Go, go, go, go, go, go.
- Go, go, go, go.

1444
01:12:16,773 --> 01:12:18,841
- You gotta go now.
- Go, now!

1446
01:12:20,443 --> 01:12:21,878

Oh, God.

We made it.

1452
01:12:51,741 --> 01:12:52,975
Oh, God.

1453
01:12:59,649 --> 01:13:01,050
Put your headsets on.

1454
01:13:12,361 --> 01:13:13,496
Get Brett on the radio.

1455
01:13:13,563 --> 01:13:17,300
That idiot detonated. He didn't listen.

1456
01:13:17,366 --> 01:13:19,335
No, we need to get Governor Barber on the phone.

1457
01:13:19,402 --> 01:13:21,437
We need to get evac to higher ground.

1458
01:13:21,504 --> 01:13:24,107
There is no higher ground.

1459
01:13:24,173 --> 01:13:25,775
The Mississippi started flooding.

1460
01:13:25,842 --> 01:13:28,811
The United States is going to completely split east to west.

1461
01:13:31,013 --> 01:13:32,348
There is nothing we can do.

Brett, your alive.

01:14:11,154 --> 01:14:13,289
Hey, we're headed your way.

1467
01:14:13,356 --> 01:14:15,758
Negative, negative. Everything's been destroyed.

1468
01:14:15,825 --> 01:14:19,729
All systems are down. It's gone. All gone.

1469
01:14:19,796 --> 01:14:21,164
Mission's a failure.

1470
01:14:22,665 --> 01:14:24,767
Where are you?

1471
01:14:24,834 --> 01:14:26,869
Should have listened to Alan.

1472
01:14:26,936 --> 01:14:29,172
Last check was 32 minutes

1473
01:14:29,238 --> 01:14:31,607
until the fault splits apart completely.

1474
01:14:33,676 --> 01:14:35,845
We failed.

1475
01:14:35,912 --> 01:14:38,181
We still have time.

1476
01:14:38,247 --> 01:14:41,417
Do we have anything, any weapons to use as an ordinance?

1477
01:14:42,618 --> 01:14:46,155
We brought another warhead as a backup but

1478
01:14:46,222 --> 01:14:49,492
with the granite encasement around the fault,

1479
01:14:49,559 --> 01:14:51,828
we've got nothing.

1480
01:14:51,894 --> 01:14:53,496
ALAN: Where is it?

1481
01:14:53,563 --> 01:14:55,131
On board.

1482
01:14:55,198 --> 01:14:57,200
It won't do us any good though, Doctor.

1483
01:14:57,266 --> 01:14:59,836
There's no way we're boring a hole that deep.

1484
01:14:59,902 --> 01:15:02,138
How much time do we have?

1485
01:15:02,205 --> 01:15:04,707
About 28 minutes.

1486
01:15:04,774 --> 01:15:06,242
Where's the weakest point?

1487
01:15:06,309 --> 01:15:08,978
The weakest point is about a mile north of Marston.

1488
01:15:09,045 --> 01:15:10,680
See, right there.

1489
01:15:10,746 --> 01:15:12,148
Right there?

1490
01:15:12,215 --> 01:15:14,250
That's my decommissioned fracking site.

1491
01:15:14,317 --> 01:15:15,885
Well, how deep does it go?

1492
01:15:15,952 --> 01:15:17,720
It's about 5,000 feet.

1493
01:15:17,787 --> 01:15:19,121
The heart of the fault.

1494
01:15:19,188 --> 01:15:21,257
I hate to say this, but Dad's fracking site

1495
01:15:21,324 --> 01:15:23,292
may actually be a good thing this time.

1496
01:15:23,359 --> 01:15:25,428
Wait, won't the site be underwater?

1497
01:15:25,494 --> 01:15:28,898
No, Marston's on a plateau, 300 feet above sea level.

1498
01:15:28,965 --> 01:15:30,199
It should be dry.

1499
01:15:30,266 --> 01:15:32,134
Brett, meet us at the airport in Marston.

1500
01:15:32,201 --> 01:15:34,437
I'll send you the coordinates.

1501
01:15:34,503 --> 01:15:37,006
Maybe, just, maybe we can stop this thing.

1502
01:15:47,783 --> 01:15:50,319
All right, drive it right here.

1503
01:15:50,386 --> 01:15:53,589
All right, everybody. There's no room for mistakes.

1504
01:15:53,656 --> 01:15:57,827
So, mini tactical nuclear weapon wired with a remote detonator.

1505
01:15:57,894 --> 01:16:00,963
Push these seven in sequential order to arm it.

1506
01:16:01,030 --> 01:16:04,433
Push this eighth detonator button when you're ready.

1507
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:05,534
But be careful.

1508
01:16:05,601 --> 01:16:06,903
You need a clear signal.

1509
01:16:06,969 --> 01:16:09,272
No obstructions between you and the bomb.

1510
01:16:09,338 --> 01:16:11,107
And once you trigger it, you have 30 seconds

1511
01:16:11,173 --> 01:16:12,675
to get out of there.

1512
01:16:12,742 --> 01:16:14,310
Got it.

1513
01:16:14,377 --> 01:16:16,412
You're not coming with us. Go with Brett and his pilot.

1514
01:16:16,479 --> 01:16:18,848
- What?
- No, I'm going with you.

1515
01:16:18,915 --> 01:16:22,218
Please, after Karla, I can't let that happen again.

1516
01:16:22,285 --> 01:16:23,419
Mom, I'm coming, too.

1517
01:16:23,486 --> 01:16:24,787
Somebody's got to fly that helo.

1518
01:16:24,854 --> 01:16:26,155
That's not a good idea.

1519
01:16:26,222 --> 01:16:28,424
Cami, you don't have any time to argue.

1520
01:16:28,491 --> 01:16:31,861
Look, Mom, none of us are going to sit this one out.

1521
01:16:31,928 --> 01:16:34,096
All right? Not for this.

1522
01:16:34,163 --> 01:16:36,565
And none of us want to get hurt either, but it's our choice.

1523
01:16:36,632 --> 01:16:37,767
Okay? Not yours.

1524
01:16:37,833 --> 01:16:39,769
We can handle this.

1525
01:16:39,835 --> 01:16:41,537
Okay.

1526
01:16:41,604 --> 01:16:43,906
Are we certain it's my mine in Marston?

1527
01:16:43,973 --> 01:16:45,808
Location confirmed.

1528
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:47,243
Dan, thank you for everything.

1529
01:16:47,310 --> 01:16:49,011
You stepped up when you didn't have to.

1530
01:16:49,078 --> 01:16:51,113
No, no, I had to.

1531
01:16:54,417 --> 01:16:56,018
All right, let's get this done, guys.

1532
01:16:56,085 --> 01:16:57,887
Give you a hand.

1533
01:16:57,954 --> 01:16:59,588
Be careful.

1534
01:17:27,316 --> 01:17:29,452
All right, you see that field up there?

1535
01:17:29,518 --> 01:17:30,720
Yep.

1536
01:17:30,786 --> 01:17:32,388
I think that's a good spot to set her down.

1537
01:17:32,455 --> 01:17:33,589
- Copy that.
- That's where we're going.

1538
01:17:33,656 --> 01:17:34,590
Okay?

1539
01:17:37,393 --> 01:17:40,629
See that? That tower moving?

1540
01:17:42,098 --> 01:17:44,567
That's not the wind.

1541
01:17:44,633 --> 01:17:45,568
A foreshock.

1542
01:17:47,670 --> 01:17:49,372
We've only got eight minutes. We need to hurry.

1543
01:17:49,438 --> 01:17:52,108
All right, okay, nice deep approach.

1544
01:17:52,174 --> 01:17:55,244
All right, I lower collective right paddle.

1545
01:17:55,311 --> 01:17:57,213
Watch your airspeed. Watch your airspeed.

1546
01:17:57,279 --> 01:17:58,881
I got it. I got it. I got it.

1547
01:17:58,948 --> 01:18:01,017
All right.

1548
01:18:01,083 --> 01:18:02,818
Your VSI. I'm just saying...

1549
01:18:02,885 --> 01:18:04,520
Dad, please. Thank you.

1550
01:18:04,587 --> 01:18:06,055
- I'm just saying.
- I got it.

1551
01:18:06,122 --> 01:18:07,056
I know you're saying but I got it.

1552
01:18:07,123 --> 01:18:09,058
Easy. Okay, good.

1553
01:18:09,125 --> 01:18:10,860
Nose through it, nice.

1554
01:18:10,926 --> 01:18:13,129
All right, let's set it down.

1555
01:18:13,195 --> 01:18:15,965
Eyes out front. Eyes out front.

1556
01:18:16,032 --> 01:18:17,767
Let's skid down and right.

1557
01:18:22,638 --> 01:18:24,306
Nice job.

1558
01:18:24,373 --> 01:18:25,875
- You did it, kid.
- We don't have much time.

1559
01:18:25,941 --> 01:18:27,476
We got to hurry.

1560
01:18:27,543 --> 01:18:28,978
Eric, you sure you got this?

1561
01:18:29,045 --> 01:18:30,046
Got it, Mom.

1562
01:18:30,112 --> 01:18:31,480
You got this?

1563
01:18:31,547 --> 01:18:32,681
- I got it.
- You sure?

1564
01:18:32,748 --> 01:18:33,849
Because I can do this.

1565
01:18:33,916 --> 01:18:36,285
-Dad, I got it
-Alan...

1566
01:18:36,352 --> 01:18:38,621
- I got it.
- He's good. All right.

1567
01:18:38,687 --> 01:18:39,722
You got it, kids.

1568
01:18:39,789 --> 01:18:40,756
Come on, let's hurry.

1569
01:18:40,823 --> 01:18:42,191
All right.

1570
01:18:53,736 --> 01:18:55,771
- Ready?
- Ready.

1571
01:18:55,838 --> 01:18:57,239
- Got it?
- Ready?

1572
01:18:57,306 --> 01:19:00,142
Okay, give me slack. Eric, give me slack. Thank you.

1573
01:19:00,209 --> 01:19:01,777
That's it.

1574
01:19:03,345 --> 01:19:05,748
- Go up.
- Take it up, take it up, go, go.

1575
01:19:12,188 --> 01:19:13,923
Nice and steady, full power.

1576
01:19:13,989 --> 01:19:16,025
Eyes out front, eyes out front.

1577
01:19:16,092 --> 01:19:17,593
Correct for that yaw right there.

1578
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:18,661
There you go.

1579
01:19:18,727 --> 01:19:20,296
Give me a little left pedal on that.

1580
01:19:23,866 --> 01:19:26,368
- The tower!
- Watch out! The tower!

1581
01:19:29,972 --> 01:19:31,240
[grunting]

1582
01:19:34,243 --> 01:19:35,811
Eric, I need you to straighten it out.

1583
01:19:35,878 --> 01:19:36,912
Straight... no, no, no, no.

1584
01:19:36,979 --> 01:19:38,214
Don't go over there.

1585
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,082
- Eric!
- I'm trying, I'm trying.

1586
01:19:40,149 --> 01:19:41,083
I thought you knew how to fly.

1587
01:19:41,150 --> 01:19:42,084
Steady, steady.

1588
01:19:42,151 --> 01:19:43,886
Full power, Eric.

1589
01:19:46,122 --> 01:19:47,223
Eric!

1590
01:19:47,289 --> 01:19:49,258
Come on, get control of it!

1591
01:19:49,325 --> 01:19:51,060
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1592
01:19:51,127 --> 01:19:52,795
Whoa, Eric, Eric! No, no, no, no.

1593
01:19:52,862 --> 01:19:54,330
Full power, full power.

1594
01:19:54,396 --> 01:19:55,598
Don't let it do that to you.

1595
01:19:55,664 --> 01:19:57,066
Get out of my ear. I'm doing it.

1596
01:19:57,133 --> 01:19:58,701
Whoa!

1597
01:19:58,767 --> 01:20:00,669
Eric, the bomb, you need to steady.

1598
01:20:00,736 --> 01:20:02,905
Pull up, full power, give me some left pedal.

1599
01:20:02,972 --> 01:20:04,140
Point it into the wind.

1600
01:20:04,206 --> 01:20:05,341
Okay, got it.

1601
01:20:09,011 --> 01:20:10,112
There you go, you got it?

1602
01:20:10,179 --> 01:20:11,380
It's really windy, Dad.

1603
01:20:11,447 --> 01:20:12,715
There you go, there you go.

1604
01:20:12,781 --> 01:20:15,551
Okay, stay in the wind. Grab it in the wind.

1605
01:20:15,618 --> 01:20:16,719
You're good, you're good right there.

1606
01:20:16,785 --> 01:20:18,554
All right, we need to set the well.

1607
01:20:18,621 --> 01:20:20,289
- Let's go.
- All right, I'm heading over.

1608
01:20:20,356 --> 01:20:23,325
At the well, over the tower this way.

1609
01:20:30,332 --> 01:20:31,901
How deep does this thing go?

1610
01:20:31,967 --> 01:20:34,236
About 1,000 feet.

1611
01:20:34,303 --> 01:20:35,704
Yeah, right through here, watch the tower.

1612
01:20:35,771 --> 01:20:37,740
- Straighten up.
- Straight up over the top.

1613
01:20:37,806 --> 01:20:39,875
Keep it steady.

1614
01:20:39,942 --> 01:20:41,877
I'm keeping it as steady as I can.

1615
01:20:41,944 --> 01:20:44,346
Bring it toward me, little more toward me.

1616
01:20:44,413 --> 01:20:45,347
There you go.

1617
01:20:45,414 --> 01:20:47,616
Easy, right there.

1618
01:20:47,683 --> 01:20:48,918
It's good, looking good.

1619
01:20:48,984 --> 01:20:50,486
Lower the collective just a little bit.

1620
01:20:50,553 --> 01:20:52,221
- Good job.
- Very nice, okay.

1621
01:20:52,288 --> 01:20:53,556
That kid.

1622
01:20:53,622 --> 01:20:54,957
I wonder where he gets this from.

1623
01:20:56,025 --> 01:20:57,626
Two more lefts.

1624
01:20:57,693 --> 01:21:00,029
There you go, looking really good. Nice and steady.

1625
01:21:00,095 --> 01:21:02,164
Keep it right there, keep it right there.

1626
01:21:02,231 --> 01:21:03,265
Nice.

1627
01:21:03,332 --> 01:21:04,333
Five more feet, that's good.

1628
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,869
Keep coming, coming, right here.

1629
01:21:06,936 --> 01:21:09,738
That's it, right there. Last five feet, we got it.

1630
01:21:09,805 --> 01:21:11,607
As soon as I start this, we've got about 30 seconds

1631
01:21:11,674 --> 01:21:13,442
until it hits the bottom and we've got to clear out.

1632
01:21:13,509 --> 01:21:14,977
It's going to be 30 seconds you guys,

1633
01:21:15,044 --> 01:21:16,612
then we're out, then we're up and out of here.

1634
01:21:16,679 --> 01:21:18,981
All right, let me know when.

1635
01:21:20,950 --> 01:21:22,985
Everybody ready?

1636
01:21:23,052 --> 01:21:25,588
Okay, I'm going to arm it.

1637
01:21:25,654 --> 01:21:26,755
Three...

1638
01:21:27,823 --> 01:21:28,757
Two...

1639
01:21:29,858 --> 01:21:31,160
One!

1640
01:21:31,227 --> 01:21:32,595
Drop it.

1641
01:21:34,196 --> 01:21:35,231
Go.

1642
01:21:35,297 --> 01:21:36,832
Okay, now go, go, go.

1643
01:21:36,899 --> 01:21:39,835
- Nice, we got it, we got it.
- All right, pulling out.

1644
01:21:39,902 --> 01:21:41,103
Go, go, go, go, go!

1645
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:42,571
- Let's go, let's go.
- Lower the ladder!

1646
01:21:42,638 --> 01:21:45,207
Okay, let me know when, let me know when.

1647
01:21:45,274 --> 01:21:49,945
Bring the ladder over here, in here, right in the zone.

1648
01:21:50,012 --> 01:21:51,814
All right, heading over.

1649
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:53,249
Yeah, meet us here, meet us here.

1650
01:21:53,315 --> 01:21:55,818
Come back to the LZ, LZ right here.

1651
01:21:55,884 --> 01:21:58,854
Okay, lower it down, lower it.

1652
01:21:58,921 --> 01:22:00,623
Okay, lowering.

1653
01:22:04,093 --> 01:22:05,194
Eric, it's broken.

1654
01:22:05,261 --> 01:22:06,695
What do you mean it's broken?

1655
01:22:06,762 --> 01:22:08,397
It's broken, it's only going part way,

1656
01:22:08,464 --> 01:22:09,632
you need to get lower.

1657
01:22:09,698 --> 01:22:11,467
- Lower!
- Wherever you got, lower it.

1658
01:22:11,533 --> 01:22:13,269
I'm as low as possible, I can't go any lower.

1659
01:22:13,335 --> 01:22:14,970
Okay, hold it steady.

1660
01:22:15,037 --> 01:22:16,338
Okay, grab the ladder.

1661
01:22:16,405 --> 01:22:21,377
Go, go, go, go, run, jump, jump.

1662
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:24,680
Steady.

1663
01:22:24,747 --> 01:22:26,548
Hang on.

1664
01:22:29,818 --> 01:22:30,819
Okay, yeah, yeah, they got it.

1665
01:22:30,886 --> 01:22:32,288
They got it? Yeah, yeah.

1666
01:22:32,354 --> 01:22:33,689
Let's go, get out of here, buddy.

1667
01:22:33,756 --> 01:22:34,990
Whoo!

1668
01:22:42,564 --> 01:22:44,300
FINN: Five, four,

1669
01:22:44,366 --> 01:22:47,736
three, two, one.

1670
01:22:47,803 --> 01:22:49,104
[explosion]

1671
01:22:56,178 --> 01:22:57,846
Whoa... whoa.

1672
01:22:57,913 --> 01:22:59,548
Are they alive?

1673
01:23:02,718 --> 01:23:04,086
- Are they good?
- They're on the ladder.

1674
01:23:04,153 --> 01:23:05,521
Whoo!

1675
01:23:05,587 --> 01:23:07,156
All right, heading out.

1676
01:23:07,222 --> 01:23:08,624
[laughing]

1677
01:23:08,691 --> 01:23:10,459
- We did it.
- We did it.

1678
01:23:10,526 --> 01:23:11,493
We did it!

1679
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:13,262
Oh, yeah!

1680
01:23:13,329 --> 01:23:14,797
You were awesome out there.

1681
01:23:14,863 --> 01:23:16,565
You are too.

1682
01:23:18,567 --> 01:23:20,669
Hey Mom and Dad, we're reeling you in.

1683
01:23:26,408 --> 01:23:29,211
FINN: Cami, pressure has been relieved all along the fault

1684
01:23:29,278 --> 01:23:33,315
and the water is receding.

1685
01:23:33,382 --> 01:23:36,218
CAMI: It worked! 10.0 averted.

1686
01:23:36,285 --> 01:23:37,753
Good job everyone.

1687
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:39,288
The damage done was catastrophic,

1688
01:23:39,355 --> 01:23:40,522
nothing can change that.

1689
01:23:40,589 --> 01:23:42,191
But at least we can rebuild.

1690
01:23:42,257 --> 01:23:46,362
A quake like that shouldn't happen again.

1691
01:23:46,428 --> 01:23:48,497
How about that flying, Pops? Whoo!

1692
01:23:48,564 --> 01:23:51,233
Yeah, Eric, man, I'm so proud of you.

1693
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:53,569
Flew the crap out of this bird.

1694
01:23:53,635 --> 01:23:55,037
Nicely done, brother.

1695
01:23:55,104 --> 01:23:56,271
Woo-hoo! Yeah.

1696
01:23:56,338 --> 01:23:59,708
Oh man, now you see why I got out of this racket.

1697
01:24:02,745 --> 01:24:04,813
Even though I do still miss it sometimes.

1698
01:24:06,782 --> 01:24:10,452
Yeah? You ever think about coming back?

1699
01:24:10,519 --> 01:24:12,020
Yeah, I think about coming back.

1700
01:24:14,256 --> 01:24:16,892
But...

1701
01:24:16,959 --> 01:24:19,528
You and Finn?

1702
01:24:19,595 --> 01:24:21,897
We talked.

1703
01:24:21,964 --> 01:24:24,967
He's a really good person and I'll always care about him.

1704
01:24:25,033 --> 01:24:26,835
But... 1705
01:24:
