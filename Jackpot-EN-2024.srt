No, our daughter did not get the part.

61
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,375
She totally shit the bed.

62
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,166
Got in the audition room
and completely clammed up like an amateur.

63
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,375
I-I thought you ran
those goddamned lines with her.

64
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:53,618
Well, it didn't work, did it?

65
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,083
All she had to do, Leanne,

66
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,142
was catch the baseball,
wink at the camera and say,

67
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,309
"Betty Butter is the best butter
when buying better butter."

68
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,875
I just fucking did it.
I just fucking did it.

69
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,666
Well, it was a big job, Leanne, okay,
and she fucking blew it.

70
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,791
Maybe she'd book more mature parts, Leann,

71
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,083
if she didn't dress
like Strawberry fucking Shortcake.

72
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,416
Don't you hang up. Goddamn it.

73
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,833
Oh, sure, now you can act,
when there's no one who can hire you.

74
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,250
That's great.

75
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,500
Give me a goddamn break.

76
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,416
I don't want to make a scene
in front of your, uh, daughter

77
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,458
because you're her daddy
and little girls love their daddies

78
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,583
even when they're assholes,
but maybe if you weren't such an asshole

79
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,559
and asked her if she actually
wanted to be an actor,

80
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:42,416
she wouldn't grow up
to fucking hate your guts.

81
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,041
Thanks, Dr. Phil.
How much do I owe you for that bullshit?

82
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,958
Why don't I report you to child services
for child abuse?

83
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:54,083
You know, I'm off duty, but I can
definitely still arrest you, if you want.

84
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,541
You're a cop?

Officer Katherine Kim,
Ventura County license 62638.

86
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,708
So, I highly suggest you start treating
your daughter like a human being

87
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,500
as opposed to a fucking ATM.

88
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,666
Yeah.

89
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,250
I really do like your dress, sweetie.

90
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,708
Sorry for all the bad words.

91
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,916
I only curse when your mom's
being a fucking bitch.

92

Excuse me, do you have the time?

93
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,916
Oh, yeah.

94
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,416
- It's, uh, 4:30.
- Uh-huh.

95
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,833
You're a little young for a cop.

96
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,250
Um...

97
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,791
Well, I'm not a cop.

98
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,125
I'm an actor.

99
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,833
I knew it.

100
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,458
You're pretty good.

101
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,583
Thanks.

102
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,250
Yeah, I just hate fuckers like that.

103
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,333
Yeah.

104
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,684
So, what would I have seen you...?

105
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:47,333
All right, did you play a businesswoman
who moved to a small town

106
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,333
and learned to love Christmas again?

107
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,833
No.

108
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,541
- Then I probably wouldn't have seen you.
- Hmm.

109
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:56,125
I've been, uh, out of the business
for a while.

110
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,208
- And now you're back?
- Yeah.

111
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,583
Me and millions of other people.

112
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,125
My dear, you listen.

113
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,625
There's only one you.

114
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,625
You are unique
and you have your own voice.

115
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,750
Now, you just be true to who you are.

116
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,541
You're gonna make it, I can feel it.

117
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,291
Oh.

118
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,375
Well... thanks.

119
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,166
That was really nice.

120
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,375
Now, what's your name?

121
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,309
Because I want to keep an eye out for you
when you're famous.

122
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,083
Katie. Katie Kim.

123
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,875
Oh, well, Miss Kim...

124
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,958
...I hope your legs fall off?

125
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,083
I-Isn't that what actors say?

126
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,583
Yeah, that's exactly what they say.

127
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,166

Lottery Day? What does that mean?

161
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,833
Lottery Day.

162
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,767
No, yeah, I heard you.
It's just I'm new in town,

163
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,072
- so I'm not really up on the L.A. stuff.
- Read the sign.

164
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,416
Oh.

Well, at least the neighborhood's diverse.

170
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,500
It smells like shit and piss.

171
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,041
Get in the back!

172
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,708
Get in the back of the car!

173
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,208
Ta-da.

174
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,583
Oh, wow.

175
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:18,708
It looks a little different from...
the Airbnb photos.

176
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,458
Yeah, I think the lighting is different.

177
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,541
Well, the entire room is different.

178
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,708
Oh, yeah, no, it was a different house,
'cause we use fake photos.

179
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,666
'Cause, like, who's gonna stay here
if we don't?

180
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,875
Wow, I've never been catfished
by a house before.

181
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,500
What?

182
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,333
Oh, wow. Okay.

183
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:38,958
That's interesting. Is this you?

184
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,916
Oh, my God. Yeah, that's me.

185
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,875
That's my manifestation board.

186
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,583
You gotta manifest the stuff you want

187
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,142
or else bad stuff's gonna happen
to you, dude.

188
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,500
- This is a nice, nice little bed here.
- Hmm.

189
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,583
So, why are you here?

190
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:53,708
Are you here for, like,
pleasure or pain or...

191
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:54,791
No, I'm an actress.

192
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,458
Yeah, me, I'm a marine biologist at NASA.

193
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:01,708
Why would NASA need a marine biologist?

194
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,250
Psych, bitch.

195
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,166
- I got you. I totally fooled you.
- Yeah.

196
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,500
I'm an actress, too.

197
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,166
Actress recognize actress, okay?

198
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,309
Are you gonna get that?

199
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,208
- The phone?
- Oh.

200
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,625
Oh, no.

201
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,083
Oh, my God. 'Cause I know...

202
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:22,041
- Yeah, it's my fucking mom. Bye.
- Oh.

203
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,583
She calls me all the time.

204
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,166
I haven't answered in two years.

205
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,333
How 'bout that?

206
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,392
Then she just calls and calls and calls.
And she's like,

207
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,166
"Shadi, I love you."

208
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,041
"Shadi, I miss you."

209
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,458
"Shadi, how are you?"

210
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,041
Hmm. That's sweet.

211
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,541
Fucking asshole.

212
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,833
- My mom's dead.
- Lucky.

213
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,041
Yo!

214
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,750
Oh, my God, DJ's here. DJ.

215
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,791
DJ. DJ.

216
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,125
- DJ!
- DJ!

217
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,601
- Oh, my God.
- Wh-why don't you just go out...

218
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,025
I can't wait for you to meet him.
You're gonna literally die.

219
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:54,500
- He's a deejay named DJ.
- Wow.

220
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,103
- I, honestly, I think his parents were fucking psychic.
- Right.

221
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,458
- You've got to meet DJ. Come on.
- Oh.

222
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:02,583
- Baby!
- Baby!

223
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,226
- You see how big the jackpot is?
- Oh, my God.

224
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,833
Like, what, like, $3 billion.

225
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,833
That's, like, twice as much as a million.

226
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,375
- That's so...
- This door!

227
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,892
Yeah. That's us.
That's you and me.

228
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,750
- That's you and me. That's you and me.
- That's you and me.

229
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,500
Come here, come here.

230
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,875
Okay.

231
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,083
This is DJ.

232
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,625
- This is him.
- Hi. - Hey, I'm DJ.

233
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,166
- Uh, really cool to meet you. Yeah.
- Yeah, you, too.

234
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,392
Do you guys have a house key?

235
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,083
- Yeah. Oh, here you go.
- Oh.

236
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,267
- Yeah, just go for it.
- Thank you. Thank...

237
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,333
- Oh.
- Oh.

238
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:30,875
Oh, shit. Oh, I'm so sorry.

239
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,583
- What the fuck was that?
- Babe?

240
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,458
- I thought you were gonna dodge it.
- Why?

241
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:37,166
Look at your bag.
It says you go to fighting school.

242
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,791
Oh. Okay, what the fuck is stage fighting?

243
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,166
It's fake fighting for movies.

244
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,916
Wait, they fake fight in movies?

245
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,101
Can I have the fucking keys, please?

246
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,767
- Could you chill. Could you just chill.
- No.

247
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,500
May I have the house keys, please?

248
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:50,892
- Yeah, sure. Here you go.
- Thanks.

249
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,166
Ooh.

250
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,666
You got quick hands, Katie.

251
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,031
- That was a good catch.
- That was a great catch.

252
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Mm.

253
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,166
What's her problem?

254
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,333
She's an actress.

255
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,083
Fuck.

256
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,291
No, we're not cool.

257
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:29,851
<i>Hey there.</i>

258
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,392
<i>Did you just win the Grand Lottery?</i>

259
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:34,208
<i>Is every citizen of Los Angeles
now trying to murder you</i>

260
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,416
<i>so they can win an unimaginably
large sum of money?</i>

261
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,916
{\an8}<i>Well, you can turn to me, Noel Cassidy.</i>

262
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,541
{\an8}<i>I will get you to sundown.</i>

263
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,309
<i>Sundown, sundown.</i>

264
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:57,916
Oh, what the...?

265
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,166
Oh, shit.

266
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,583
Oh!

267
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,083
What... What is that?

268
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,916
What the fuck is that?

269
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,791
Is this my new friend, Katie Kim?

270
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,000
Did it rain last night?

271
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:19,250
'Cause there seems to be
a pretty big leak in your ceiling.

272
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,666
That's crap. It doesn't rain in L.A.

273
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,416
No, I'm not lying.
There really is a leak in your ceiling.

274
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,000
No, I know it's leaking.

275
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,916
That's actual crap.
We have a sewage thing.

276
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,166
Um, it's just that all
of my-my clothes are wrecked

277
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,625
and-and I have a showcase
in a couple hours.

278
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,000
Man, Katie, I feel so bad about this.

279
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,750
Like, let me make it right.

280
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,625
Why don't you pay me to rent my clothes?

281
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,458
You want me to pay you?

282
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,458
It's your sewage on my clothes.

283
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,375
<i>Whoa, it's not my sewage.</i>

284
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:48,750
It's the people upstairs.

285
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,958
My sewage leaks on Mrs. Kachekarian.

286
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,666
Okay.

287
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,916
How much for the clothes?

288
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,833
Uh... $40. That's the going rate.

289
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,291
Fine.

290
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,458
Great.

291
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,892
Oh, this is going to be so fun.
We're going to look like twins.

292
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,708
Worth every penny.

293
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,375
You going to Comic Con or something?

294
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:14,708
No. Why do you say that?

295
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,101
If you're not going to Comic Con,

296
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,851
why are you dressed like
the British robot from <i>Star Wars?</i>

297
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,000
How far are we from the destination?

298
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,708
Wait a second, are you famous?

299
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,166
- I recognize you.
- Uh-huh.

300
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,708
- I do.
- It's possible. I was in...

301
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,017
Are you in that video where you put
a can of Monster up your butt?

302
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,166
No, that wasn't me.

303
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,083
- It was orange flavor.
- You think the flavor would jog my memory?

304
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,767
I don't know what it's like
to shove something like that up my butt.

305
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,833
I don't either.

306
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:38,125
I worked with a ton of celebrities
when I did construction.

307
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,226
I actually installed
Machine Gun Kelly's panic room.

308
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,416
What does Machine Gun Kelly
have to panic about?

309
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,375
Running out of skin to tattoo?

310
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:45,875
What do you think I'd panic about?

311
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,541
Not talking?

312
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:48,750
Bingo.

313
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,673
Awesome.
I think I'm gonna put my headphones in

314
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,601
for the rest of the ride,
if that's okay with you.

315
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,065
Okay, keep the volume low
so you can hear me when I say stuff.

316
00:16:56,666 --> 00:17:00,916
<i>Okay, make sure
to thumb-print those lotto tickets, L.A.,</i>

317
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,875
<i>because we are just ten minutes away from
drawing our biggest jackpot winner yet.</i>

318
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,333
Great. They're rebooting Barbie.

319
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:25,416
Katie Kim.

320
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,250
Oh, yes, present.

321
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,958
All right, so,
we're just about ready for you,

322
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,333
but first, that's going to be $400.

323
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,625
Oh.

324
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,458
Because it had said $200 online.

325
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:41,750
Yeah, that's our online price.

326
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,458
In person, it's $400.

327
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:47,208
Oh. Well, in that case, maybe I can go
get a computer and just do that online.

328
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,541
Oh, I wish. That'd be so great, right?

329
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,458
Unfortunately, you're here,

330
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:55,083
in person, so it's $400.

331
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,250
Are you serious about being famous?

332
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,416
Yeah.

333
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,791
Oh. Real cash.

334
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,125
- It's retro.
- Yeah.

335
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,500
Okay, come on in, and hey, smile.
It's your big break.

336
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,958
Come on.

337
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,166
'Kay.

338
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,083
Oof.

339
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,791
Hi. I'm Katie.

340
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,958
You just come from some sci-fi thing?

341
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,083
Oh. No, I...

342
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,083
- Any acting experience?
- Yeah, totally.

343
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,375
Uh, mostly when I was younger.

344
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,000
You couldn't turn on the TV
in the mid-2000s without seeing me.

345
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:32,125
Oh, are you the kid from the
Spaghetti Squares commercials?

346
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:35,458
Yeah. "Who cares? It's Spaghetti Squares."

347
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,750
Well, we are honored to have
canned pasta royalty in our presence.

348
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,125
So, anything since Spaghetti Squares?

349
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,458
I was taking care of my sick mom
back in Michigan,

350
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:48,791
and, uh, just got back into town
and ready to act.

351
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,541
You left your mom by herself?

352
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:51,875
Is she okay?

353
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,791
No, she died.

354
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,500
No, so she's not.

355
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:56,750
Which I thought was implied.

356
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,625
Oh.

357
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,125
Did you kill her?

358
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,541
No, um...

359
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,267
All right, well, is this your monologue,
or did you prepare something?

360
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,250
No, I-I... Sorry, I have something, yeah.

361
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,916
<i>Registering player
for the next draw.</i>

362
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,833
<i>Good luck, Katie Kim.</i>

363
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,434
Hey, Spaghetti Squares, are you ready?
We got a lot of girls waiting.

364
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,958
Yeah, yes. I'm going to start.

365
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,184
- You should really have that memorized.
- I do, I do. I'm sorry.

366
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,833
Real actors are always off-book.

367
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:26,708
Yes, and I am also a real actor,
so I will be going off-book.

368
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:27,791
Enough!

369
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,291
That's enough now.

370
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,458
From all of you.

371
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,583
You think water moves fast?

372
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,041
Well, you should see ice.

373
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,416
It moves like it has a mind.

374
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,958
Like it killed the world once...

375
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,250
- Touch your toes.
- Is that from <i>Deep Blue Sea?</i>

376
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,583
Uh...

377
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,166
Sorry, I-I, I just, I had more.

378
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,684
I want to know if you're flexible,
so touch your toes, please.

379
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,083
Why?

380
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,916
'Cause we want to see
how vulnerable you are.

381
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Mm. Mm-hmm.

382
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,833
Could I see you, uh, jiggle a little?

383
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:53,958
Give me my money back.

384
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,625
You paid to be seen. You were seen.

385
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,333
- Libby.
- Oh, that's me.

386
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,125
- Hi.
- Hi. Good to see you.

387
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,916
Hey. Don't let them get to you.

388
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,833
You are worth so much more than this.

389
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:13,083
Thank you. I, like, I really needed
to hear that today.

390
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,208
Hey.

391
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:16,791
Don't let them get to you.

392
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:19,041
You are worth so much more than this.

393
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,333
Don't let them get to you.

394
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,083
You are worth so much more than this.

395
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,458
- So much...
- Break a leg.

396
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,333
You break a leg, bitch.

397
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,541
Break your entire fucking body.

398
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:28,875
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

399
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,666
Are you seeing it's her?

400
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,500
Oh.

401
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,041
Excuse me.

402
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:56,291
Oh, I-I definitely didn't get the part,
so there's no need for the death stare.

403
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,958
Oh. Oh.

404
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,291
Ow.

405
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,458
Oh, shit.

406
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:08,791
What the fuck, ladies?

407
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,075
"Break a leg" means good luck
in the theater. Calm down.

408
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,583
Back off, Riley. She's my jackpot.

409
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,250
Congrats, girlie. You're famous now.

410
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,291
And I'm gonna be rich.

411
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,541
Ho. Ho, ho, ho, ho.

412
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:30,875
Oh, oh, oh, not the heel.

413
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,833
Jesus. Hollywood's gotten
extremely competitive.

414
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,041
What?

415
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,500
The fuck is going on?

416
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:46,000
- She went down here.
- She's my jackpot!

417
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,208
Oh, come on.

418
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,208
She's mine.

419
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:56,375
My jackpot.

420
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,625
Jackpot!

421
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,000
Oh, shit.

422
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,500
My jackpot!

423
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:07,083
She's mine.

424
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,291
- You want some of this?
- Everyone!

425
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,583
Time out! Hey!

426
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:12,875
What is happening?

427
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,250
Everybody back off.

428
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,541
Thank you.

429
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:16,458
She's my jackpot.

430
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:18,208
What is that, a sex thing?

431
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,642
- What are you doing? Let go.
- No. No, you let go.

432
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:29,083
- Let go. Let go.
- No. I will not let go.

433
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,708
- Ma'am, ma'am.
- We're bonding. You can't kill me now.

434
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,375
Hey, girl.

435
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,333
You're better than this. Maybe you're not.

436
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,125
Can't we help each other out?

437
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:51,500
Oh!

438
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:54,125
Oh, my God! That's your student!

439
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,541
No. No, please, no.

440
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,250
Oh, my God.

441
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,166
I'm so sorry about that.

442
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,875
Ah! God, oh, my God, oh, my God.
Let me go. Let me go.

443
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:05,416
Wait, don't, don't let me go.

444
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,958
Don't let me go!

445
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,791
...elbows to bring your knees.

446
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:10,208
There we go. Beautiful.

447
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,416
Oh.

448
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,916
Oh, ladies. Thank God.

449
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:29,041
Oh. You guys have the cards, too.

450
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:31,208
Uh-oh, you guys have the cards, too.

451
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:32,809
I think I'm just gonna go
through the wall.

452
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:35,166
Okay, okay.

453
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,642
I'm-I'm going with you. I'm going with you.

454
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,791
Wait up, Trish!

455
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,708
Ow.

456
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:44,041
Katie Kim, you're mine!

457
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:45,500
It's my money!

458
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,875
- Door.
- That's my jackpot.

459
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:52,750
X block!

460
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:58,875
- You're dead.
- I'm not here.

461
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:00,309
I'm just a haunted yoga mat, y'all.

462
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:11,541
Oh, ooh, I would faint, too.

463
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:12,750
Oh, what the...!

464
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,555
Don't do it, Jessica.

465
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,416
Why me?

466
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,916
3.6 billion reasons.

467
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
What?

468
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:34,791
Now what?

469
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:42,041
No.

470
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:43,458
Ten percent.

471
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:44,916
What?

472
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:49,083
First five takedowns are free.

473
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:51,083
After that, it'll cost you ten percent.

474
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:53,166
That's freebie number two.

475
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,416
Oh!

476
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:57,666
That's freebie number three.

477
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,267
You are really burning through them, eh?

478
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:00,541
I'm keeping track.

479
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:01,875
Go.

480
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,541
- Oh, my God.
- That's freebie four.

481
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:05,791
She's mine.

482
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,291
- Here, take this.
- Gotcha.

483
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:11,809
Scroll to the bottom,
use your thumbprint to sign it.

484
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:13,458
Sorry if the screen's a bit cold.

485
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:15,041
Sign what?

486
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:18,000
That's your last freebie.

487
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,083
Guy!

488
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:24,309
Okay, you know what, he was attacking me,
so I'm not gonna charge you for that.

489
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:25,500
That's just me being nice.

490
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:27,541
All right.

491
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:29,875
Hey, why is there so much legalese
in here?

492
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:30,998
Standard terms of service.

493
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:32,851
I don't mean to push you,
but it's now or never.

494
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:33,875
Okay.

495
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:35,083
Okay, great.

496
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:37,392
Ah, congratulations.

497
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:38,934
We have a consensual
business relationship.

498
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:42,708
Hold my coattails.

499
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:50,458
- Make your feet sharp.
- What?

500
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:54,208
Whoa.

501
00:25:54,958 --> 00:25:56,708
Oh!

502
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:00,666
No, no.

503
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:04,958
- Oh, hell no.
- Oh, hell yeah.

504
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:07,458
Whoa.

505
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:12,155
I did not sign up for this shit.

506
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,666
Oh. Oh, girl. Oh, girl.

507
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,958
Ooh!

508
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:19,083
I felt that, too.

509
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:20,809
- Right in the bean.
- Okay, okay.

510
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:22,666
Okay, you done? Untie me.

511
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,916
You sure about that?

512
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:30,791
Yeah, wax off, bro.

513
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,666
You got fast hands.

514
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,000
Well, I'm not looking for
hand compliments right now.

515
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:40,625
I want to know what the fuck is going on.

516
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:42,208
And what am I threatening you with?

517
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:45,375
Oh, that shoots enzyme-protein-peptide-
bioactive constituent rounds

518
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:47,083
that cause temporary paralysis.

519
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:49,208
- What?
- Wasp venom.

520
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:52,208
Lottery security requires
a specialized set of tools.

521
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:54,833
Yeah, you-you are holding that all wrong.

522
00:26:54,916 --> 00:26:56,517
- No, I got my finger on the...
- Just it's, no, you...

523
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:57,958
Give me that thing.

524
00:26:58,041 --> 00:27:00,708
I just want you to know that I'm not mad.

525
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:04,208
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

526
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:06,476
Do you want them to choke on their tongues?

527
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,601
Based upon the last four minutes
with them, yeah, a little bit.

528
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:09,791
I would love that, actually.

529
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:13,625
Okay, listen, the drone posts
your location in 14 minutes.

530
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:15,833
- We are leaving.
- The drone? What drone?

531
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:20,559
Okay, so the rules say your fans
can't kill anyone else

532
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:21,833
for your money, just you.

533
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:24,309
Also, your fans cannot use
lethal ballistics... that means no guns...

534
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:27,833
but anything throwable is legal
and, trust me, they throw some nasty shit.

535
00:27:27,916 --> 00:27:29,000
Hold on, hold on. "Fans"?

536
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:30,208
I don't have any fans.

537
00:27:30,291 --> 00:27:32,500
Hey. It's Katie Kim.

538
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,500
We should go. Car doors open.

539
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:39,142
There she is.

540
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:40,666
That's her.

541
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,958
There's Katie!

542
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:43,642
Hey, you really don't know
what's going on?

543
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:45,500
I know you're some sort of
kung fu bodybuilder

544
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:48,333
that cares about the tongues of people
he beats up.

545
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:51,708
I mean, that feels rude,
but not inaccurate.

546
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:53,309
I need the money!

547
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:55,041
I live in that food truck!

That nice girl from the bus.

Katie, you won the lottery,

and now anyone with a losing ticket

that kills you before sundown

Oh, not in California.

569
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:47,816
It's just a chance at the big time.

570
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:50,166
Okay, when the fuck
did this become a thing?

571
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,750
I don't know, a few years ago?

572
00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:53,708
How did you not hear about this?

573
00:28:53,791 --> 00:28:56,517
Me and my mom just watched movies
and emotionally neutral baking shows.

574
00:28:56,541 --> 00:28:58,958
We didn't watch the news.
It was too depressing.

575
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:01,750
Yeah. But you gotta keep up
with what's going on in the world.

576
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:03,458
It's your duty as a citizen of Earth.

577

Hey, look, the Shutterbug's gonna post
your location every 14 minutes,

578
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:09,517
but your fans around here,
they're just gonna see it tailing us.

579
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,208
Oh, shit.

00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:18,583

I don't want to sound like

but I told you to protect the head.

618

But the only way to quit is what?

619
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:13,291

is if you leave the city.

Okay, then let's leave the city, then.

631
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,666
I want to get out of the game. Now.

632
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,791
Come on. You really mean that?

633
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:06,916
How can someone whose face
looks so much like a giant ear

634
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,875
not hear what I'm saying?

635
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:11,541
Okay, you're really bringing up
some stuff for me there.

636
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:13,500
Kids at school used to call me
Earface, okay?

637
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:15,000
Get me outta the game!

638
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:20,541
Okay, I will get you to the Grapevine,

639
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:23,125
but after I do,

We're fucked.

958
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:16,208
Not if he can't.

959
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:18,458
I'm sorry, Mr. Gun Kelly,
but you know too much.

960
00:47:18,541 --> 00:47:20,208
I-I really don't, though.

961
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:22,208
- Ow.
- Ow!

962
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:24,875
You know, I'm more of a white wine guy,
but this feels...

963
00:47:24,958 --> 00:47:27,375
...pretty good.

964
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:29,666
Oh. Ho, ho.

965
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,666
- They're over here.
- Shit, shit, shit.

966
00:47:33,833 --> 00:47:35,791
Where are you?

967
00:47:35,875 --> 00:47:36,958
Fuck.

968
00:47:41,416 --> 00:47:42,833
Nice. Whoa.

969
00:47:42,916 --> 00:47:44,083
What the fuck, dude?

970
00:47:44,166 --> 00:47:46,142
I knew you were trying to kill me
this entire time.

971
00:47:46,166 --> 00:47:47,416
Kill you?

972
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,726
I was trying to save you...
your face was just in front of my gun.

973
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,583
That is such a murder-y thing to say.

974
00:47:51,666 --> 00:47:52,916
You just want my money.

975
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,416
Really?

976
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:58,250
Okay, you know, that hurt.

977
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,625
So, Machine Gun Kelly has a panic room.

978
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:10,500
What's that guy panic about,
running out of skin to tattoo?

979
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:12,458
Am I right?

980
00:48:12,541 --> 00:48:13,916
Espresso?

981
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,458
The, uh, machine matches your outfit.

982
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,434
How'd you find out about this place?

983
00:48:20,458 --> 00:48:22,166
Lucky guess.

984
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:25,500
God, there is no way out of here.

985
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:26,750
Yeah, I see that.

986
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:28,250
I don't think you'll need one.

987
00:48:28,333 --> 00:48:29,791
He'll be out for hours.

988
00:48:29,875 --> 00:48:32,250
I think we can just wait
the whole thing out in here.

989
00:48:32,333 --> 00:48:34,250
Oh. Oh, what a surprise
that you think that.

990
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:35,833
You want to open that door

991
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:38,916
and make a sprint for the Grapevine,
be my guest, all right? Relax.

992
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,833
We're in a hermetically sealed box.

993
00:48:40,916 --> 00:48:43,236
As long as nothing unexpected
consumes our oxygen reserves,

994
00:48:43,291 --> 00:48:44,541
we're gonna be completely fine.

995
00:48:44,625 --> 00:48:47,083
Okay, can you stop reassuring me?

996
00:48:47,166 --> 00:48:49,375
I am allowed to panic in a panic room.

997
00:48:57,416 --> 00:48:59,791
We got some time to ourselves, so...

998
00:48:59,875 --> 00:49:01,208
where you from?

999
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:04,583
Me, I'm a Massachusetts boy.

1000
00:49:04,666 --> 00:49:06,500
Not the Ben Affleck part of Massachusetts.

1001
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:09,500
The part that smells like dead fish.

1002
00:49:09,583 --> 00:49:10,875
Interesting things about me:

1003
00:49:10,958 --> 00:49:13,351
I hold the World Record
for Fastest Ironing of a Dress Shirt.

1004
00:49:13,375 --> 00:49:14,458
18 seconds.

1005
00:49:14,541 --> 00:49:15,875
I'm proud of that one.

1006
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:17,642
I got two sisters,
both in law enforcement...

1007
00:49:17,666 --> 00:49:19,708
one on the good side, one on the bad side.

1008
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:21,666
Oh! I'm a Hufflepuff.

1009
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,416
Knew it right away when I read the book.

1010
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,916
Took the online test......
confirmed it.

1011
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,750
I have a single adult zoo membership.

1012
00:49:27,833 --> 00:49:29,000
And, yes, I do use it.

1013
00:49:29,083 --> 00:49:30,541
And every week I buy a bag of salad,

1014
00:49:30,625 --> 00:49:33,105
I don't touch it, it turns to mush
and I throw it in the trash.

1015
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:38,916
Oh, hey.

1016
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,208
Lucky charm?

1017
00:49:40,291 --> 00:49:42,208
Hey, man, don't touch that.

1018
00:49:42,291 --> 00:49:44,166
Relax. I thought it was cool.

1019
00:49:47,541 --> 00:49:49,083
It's stupid.

1020
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:53,666
My mom gave it to me.

1021
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:58,500
She always loved movies and movie stars,

1022
00:49:58,583 --> 00:50:03,125
so I decided to become an actor
'cause I knew it would make her happy.

1023
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:06,416
She knew Hollywood was a hard place,

1024
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:10,750
so she gave me this to remind me that
she'd be proud no matter what happened.

1025
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:17,083
I guess I still try to act because it...
makes me feel close to her.

1026
00:50:18,166 --> 00:50:20,375
Did you, did you do okay back then?

1027
00:50:20,458 --> 00:50:21,875
Yeah, I...

1028
00:50:21,958 --> 00:50:25,875
I was in a bunch of stuff,
mostly when I was a kid.

1029
00:50:25,958 --> 00:50:28,208
You make good money being a kid actor?

1030
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:29,458
No?

1031
00:50:30,541 --> 00:50:32,375
You'd have to ask my dad.

1032
00:50:32,458 --> 00:50:34,125
Wherever he is.

1033
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:40,500
Uh, well, you know, hey, look at that.

1034
00:50:40,583 --> 00:50:42,851
In a few hours, you'll never have
to worry about money again

1035
00:50:42,875 --> 00:50:44,458
for the rest of your life, so...

1036
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:47,125
If you don't kill me
and take it all for yourself.

1037
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:50,791
Wow.

1038
00:50:50,875 --> 00:50:52,041
Thanks.

1039
00:50:52,125 --> 00:50:56,250
I tell you I'm a Hufflepuff and still,
still the suspicion?

1040
00:50:58,083 --> 00:51:01,166
I don't deserve this negativity, you know,
but I always put up with it.

1041
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:03,750
That's what my therapist keeps trying
to get me to recognize.

1042
00:51:10,958 --> 00:51:12,791
Sorry.

1043
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:15,958
I want to trust you, it's just that, um...

1044
00:51:17,166 --> 00:51:20,208
...I've been proven wrong
every other time in my life.

1045
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:23,083
Katie, let me tell you something.

1046
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:29,625
Once, there were four baby turtles

1047
00:51:29,708 --> 00:51:32,291
who were thrown into a sewer
and covered in radioactive ooze.

1048
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:34,208
And what did they do?

1049
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:36,226
Did they spend their whole lives
not trusting people?

1050
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:38,541
No. No.

1051
00:51:38,625 --> 00:51:42,791
They spent their lives protecting
New Yorkers and eating pizza.

1052
00:51:42,875 --> 00:51:45,041
So...

1053
00:51:45,125 --> 00:51:47,375
So, so...

1054
00:51:47,458 --> 00:51:50,833
You... you gotta find
your inner Turtle power.

1055
00:51:52,666 --> 00:51:54,833
Can I be Michelangelo?

1056
00:51:56,875 --> 00:52:00,000
No. I'm always Michelangelo.

1057
00:52:01,958 --> 00:52:04,333
Okay, so tell me Noel,

1058
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:08,333
why would you make me sign a contract
giving you ten percent of my jackpot

1059
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:12,250
and then five minutes later
say that you'll help me quit?

1060
00:52:12,333 --> 00:52:14,333
'Cause here's my list of priorities, okay?

1061
00:52:14,416 --> 00:52:16,375
One: Save people's lives.

1062
00:52:16,458 --> 00:52:19,166
Two: Make enough money
to continue saving people's lives.

1063
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:21,583
I love what I do and I'm good at it,

1064
00:52:21,666 --> 00:52:24,101
but that doesn't mean I get the right
to make you risk your life

1065
00:52:24,125 --> 00:52:26,791
if you don't want to.

1066
00:52:26,875 --> 00:52:29,125
Katie, you're a human being,
you're not an ATM.

1067
00:52:30,708 --> 00:52:32,916
<i>Katie!</i>

1068
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,291
Oh.

1069
00:52:36,458 --> 00:52:39,250
Oh, what the fuck?

1070
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:48,416
Who's that?

1071
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,875
Some enemy from your past,
back for revenge?

1072
00:52:50,958 --> 00:52:52,458
Worse.

1073
00:52:52,541 --> 00:52:54,208
My Airbnb host.

1074
00:52:56,041 --> 00:52:57,833
I got a bad feeling about this.

1075
00:53:02,166 --> 00:53:04,291
Wake up, Colson Baker!

1076
00:53:04,916 --> 00:53:07,000
What's the code?!

1077
00:53:07,875 --> 00:53:10,250
You beautiful scarecrow.

1078
00:53:23,375 --> 00:53:25,291
What the fuck is she doing?

1079
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:28,500
Done missed work for this shit.

1080
00:53:34,875 --> 00:53:40,041
Wake your tattooed ass up!

1081
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:50,875
Did I fall asleep in the pool again?

1082
00:53:50,958 --> 00:53:53,250
- What's the code?
- Huh?

1083
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:54,583
Do you remember me?

1084
00:53:54,666 --> 00:53:56,083
We hooked up in 2019.

1085
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:57,333
It was crazy.

1086
00:53:57,416 --> 00:53:58,541
Um...

1087
00:53:58,625 --> 00:54:00,458
Fuck you. What's your code?!

1088
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:01,833
Oh, 6-9-6-9.

1089
00:54:01,916 --> 00:54:03,375
Ugh, that's so lame.

1090
00:54:05,083 --> 00:54:06,708
Oh. Oh.

1091
00:54:06,791 --> 00:54:08,083
Oh, she has the code.

1092
00:54:08,166 --> 00:54:10,250
She has the code.

1093
00:54:11,208 --> 00:54:13,500
Fu... uh, fuck.

1094
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:14,958
Fuck, fuck!

1095
00:54:15,041 --> 00:54:17,791
Fucking shit! Goddamn it!

1096
00:54:17,875 --> 00:54:18,875
- Fuck!
- Chill.

1097
00:54:18,958 --> 00:54:20,916
- Fuck it.
- What are you doing?

1098
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,833
- I'm getting us out of here.
- Okay, okay.

1099
00:54:22,916 --> 00:54:24,416
Noel Cassidy for Louis Lewis.

1100
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,041
It's an emergency.

1101
00:54:26,125 --> 00:54:29,083
Okay, then, take the phone
in the fucking bathroom!

1102
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:31,583
Motherfucker! Louis, hey. Noel.

1103
00:54:31,666 --> 00:54:34,125
Yeah. Yeah, I know, I got a lot of nerve.

1104
00:54:34,208 --> 00:54:36,625
That's why they call me
ol' Lotta Nerve Noel.

1105
00:54:36,708 --> 00:54:38,184
Yeah, I know, I know, fuck me, right?

1106
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:39,666
Yeah, yeah, I suck, yeah.

1107
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,470
Can you stop catching up
with your gym bros?

1108
00:54:41,541 --> 00:54:43,000
They're gonna come through the door.

1109
00:54:43,083 --> 00:54:44,833
Louis, I'm with the jackpot, Katie Kim.

1110
00:54:44,916 --> 00:54:46,916
Yeah, I don't know how either, yeah.

1111
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,059
We need an urgent Phone Strike
on our position, please.

1112
00:54:49,083 --> 00:54:50,250
Yes, yes and yes.

1113
00:54:50,333 --> 00:54:52,142
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you, my friend. Thank you.

1114
00:54:52,166 --> 00:54:54,434
Give me your phone. Give me your phone.
Give me your fucking phone!

1115
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:56,375
- What is a Phone Strike?
- Gonna find out.

1116
00:55:00,708 --> 00:55:02,625
- You got the code?
- I got the code.

1117
00:55:02,708 --> 00:55:04,708
6-9-6-9.

1118
00:55:04,791 --> 00:55:06,125
Machine Gun, you my boy.

1119
00:55:12,125 --> 00:55:13,833
Oh, oh.

1120
00:55:13,916 --> 00:55:15,333
Kick that phone.

1121
00:55:20,291 --> 00:55:21,892
AMBER Alert?
We're getting an AMBER Alert?

1122
00:55:21,916 --> 00:55:23,333
Hey, don't steal kids, y'all.

1123
00:55:23,416 --> 00:55:25,250
Whoa!

1124
00:55:29,666 --> 00:55:30,666
Oh, shit.

1125
00:55:32,708 --> 00:55:35,548
It's the phone, it's the phone.
Baby, get rid of the phone.

1126
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:39,166
My hand!

1127
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:41,250
- Ah, my face!
- Ah, your face!

1128
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:42,958
Babe, ow. Babe, ow.

1129
00:55:43,041 --> 00:55:44,767
- Babe, ow.
- You don't look good. You don't look good.

1130
00:55:47,583 --> 00:55:50,000
Go.

1131
00:55:50,083 --> 00:55:51,559
Shit. I know they were trying
to murder me,

1132
00:55:51,583 --> 00:55:53,458
but I'm not pro dicks on fire.

1133
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:54,791
You need to go. Go, go, go.

1134
00:55:56,166 --> 00:55:58,541
- Make it stop.
- Oh, sorry.

1135
00:55:58,625 --> 00:56:01,250
Oh, I'm sorry. It's either a hurt dick
or a burnt dick.

1136
00:56:01,333 --> 00:56:04,166
I'm doing it for your own health. It's not going out.

1137
00:56:05,916 --> 00:56:08,416
- I'm helping you. I'm helping you.
- Why?!

1138
00:56:09,875 --> 00:56:11,166
Just put some cream on that.

1139
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:12,684
You'll still be able to procreate.
I think.

1140
00:56:12,708 --> 00:56:15,458
Babe. Babe, they're getting away, babe.
They're getting away, babe.

1141
00:56:15,541 --> 00:56:16,791
Fuck this shit. Fuck this shit.

1142
00:56:16,875 --> 00:56:17,875
- I'm outtie.
- What?

1143
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:19,708
- I can't go on without you.
- You can.

1144
00:56:19,791 --> 00:56:23,458
Avenge me. Avenge, my queen.

1145
00:56:26,833 --> 00:56:28,375
Fuck.

1146
00:56:32,416 --> 00:56:33,583
There's your ride.

1147
00:56:35,666 --> 00:56:36,726
Thank you so much. This is...

1148
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:37,750
- Katie Kim?
- Yes.

1149
00:56:37,833 --> 00:56:39,892
Yeah. You guys those male strippers
from the billboards?

1150
00:56:39,916 --> 00:56:41,958
Oh. Thank you.

1151
00:56:42,041 --> 00:56:43,833
Oh, hey, fine.

1152
00:56:43,916 --> 00:56:45,041
Oh, uh, he's with me.

1153
00:56:45,125 --> 00:56:47,083
He's not on the list.

1154
00:56:47,166 --> 00:56:48,250
He's on my list.

1155
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:49,892
Well, our orders are only to bring you.

1156
00:56:49,916 --> 00:56:53,125
Okay, well... I'm the billionaire here...

1157
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:56,291
and I'm not getting in the car with you
Jason Momoa-looking motherfuckers

1158
00:56:56,375 --> 00:56:58,833
- without him.
- Thank you, but we should go.

1159
00:56:58,916 --> 00:56:59,916
- Okay.
- Just get in.

1160
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,291
Thank you.

1161
00:57:11,375 --> 00:57:13,500
Where'd she go?

1162
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:18,500
Oh, you're dead, Katie Kim.

1163
00:57:26,791 --> 00:57:28,625
Bulletproof glass. New gear.

1164
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:31,166
You guys must be doing pretty good.

1165
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:32,410
So, you work with these guys?

1166
00:57:32,458 --> 00:57:33,625
Oh, no, I'm a freelancer.

1167
00:57:33,708 --> 00:57:36,208
I... called in a favor.

1168
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:40,125
How you feeling?

1169
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:41,916
How am I feeling?

1170
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,208
Like I'm about to put some lucky
therapist's kids through college.

1171
00:57:45,291 --> 00:57:46,583
How?

1172
00:57:48,125 --> 00:57:50,458
Because I'm gonna need
a lot of therapy after this.

1173
00:57:50,541 --> 00:57:51,750
Oh, I got it in my head

1174
00:57:51,833 --> 00:57:54,958
that you were gonna start
some scholarship fund or something.

1175
00:57:55,041 --> 00:57:57,333
Oh.

1176
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:02,125
How are you feeling?

1177
00:58:02,208 --> 00:58:03,708
Oh, don't worry about me.

1178
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:05,875
I was severely traumatized
long before today.

1179
00:58:05,958 --> 00:58:07,750
Cool brag, weirdo.

1180
00:58:10,333 --> 00:58:11,958
What happens now?

1181
00:58:12,041 --> 00:58:14,250
We'll debrief you in Beverly Hills.

1182
00:58:14,333 --> 00:58:16,166
Don't worry, you're safe.

1183
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:17,708
Actually safe.

1184
00:58:17,791 --> 00:58:19,750
Yeah, cool brag.

1185
00:58:19,833 --> 00:58:21,208
Weirdo.

1186
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:25,666
I couldn't think of anything,
so I used yours 'cause I thought...

1187
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:28,142
- it got me, so I wanted to get him with it.
- No, that-that was okay.

1188
00:58:28,166 --> 00:58:31,166
That was a good use.
I think it... I think it worked.

1189
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:33,125
- We'll work on it.
- Okay.

1190
00:58:42,083 --> 00:58:43,375
We're here.

1191
00:58:43,458 --> 00:58:44,767
You guys really upgraded the place.

1192
00:58:44,791 --> 00:58:46,041
This must've cost a fortune.

1193
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:48,000
You saved that many jackpots?

1194
00:58:48,083 --> 00:58:51,250
We're the best,
and we only want the best for our clients.

1195
00:58:58,291 --> 00:59:01,041
I thought you said guns were illegal.

1196
00:59:01,125 --> 00:59:03,250
We can use rubber bullets to incapacitate.

1197
00:59:03,333 --> 00:59:05,625
But kills have to be close quarters.

1198
00:59:07,375 --> 00:59:09,250
Minimizes collateral damage.

1199
00:59:10,833 --> 00:59:14,708
The, uh, creepy guy vibes aside,
these guys are the real deal.

1200
00:59:14,791 --> 00:59:16,041
I mean, look at this place.

1201
00:59:16,125 --> 00:59:17,934
These guys could control Jurassic Park
from here.

1202
00:59:17,958 --> 00:59:19,809
Except this time
the dinosaurs wouldn't get out.

1203
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,041
Katie Kim, welcome to LPA.

1204
00:59:24,125 --> 00:59:26,250
I'm Louis. I'm a huge fan.

1205
00:59:26,333 --> 00:59:28,375
Of <i>Jurassic Park?</i>
I feel like a lot of people are.

1206
00:59:28,458 --> 00:59:29,976
That's why they make hundreds
of those movies.

1207
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,375
No, are you kidding me? Of-of you.

1208
00:59:32,458 --> 00:59:35,375
I mean, most people don't last
15 minutes without representation.

1209
00:59:35,458 --> 00:59:38,750
You've already made it several hours,
pretty much completely alone.

1210
00:59:38,833 --> 00:59:41,333
That makes me so proud to say
as an Asian man.

1211
00:59:41,416 --> 00:59:43,750
- Well, I wasn't alone.
- Of course not.

1212
00:59:43,833 --> 00:59:46,416
You had all of our ancestors
looking out for you.

1213
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,583
No, I was with him.

1214
00:59:48,666 --> 00:59:50,041
Oh, you meant Noel.

1215
00:59:50,125 --> 00:59:51,458
Okay.

1216
00:59:51,541 --> 00:59:54,261
Honestly, Noel was lucky the wind
was blowing in his direction today.

1217
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:56,309
I mean, signing a rollover jackpot
as important as you,

1218
00:59:56,333 --> 01:00:00,000
that's not a job for...
no offense, Noel... but a hobbyist.

1219
01:00:00,083 --> 01:00:03,583
Luckily, he realized that
and called us before it was too late.

1220
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:07,250
Listen, I just really want to get
to the Grapevine and finish this day.

1221
01:00:07,333 --> 01:00:09,625
Totally hear you, totally hear you.

1222
01:00:09,708 --> 01:00:11,333
But...

1223
01:00:11,416 --> 01:00:14,083
we are the biggest lottery
protection agency in the city.

1224
01:00:14,166 --> 01:00:17,500
Your life is about to change,
if you let us change it for you.

1225
01:00:17,583 --> 01:00:19,625
Hey, that reminds me. Um...

1226
01:00:19,708 --> 01:00:23,083
Please accept a little welcome gift,
on our behalf.

1227
01:00:23,166 --> 01:00:25,726
It's an official LPA phone...
so sorry you lost yours in the strike.

1228
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:28,250
Noel, use an Apple Store
across the street.

1229
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:30,583
I'm sure they got some cheap models
left in stock.

1230
01:00:31,833 --> 01:00:33,708
Come on, I'll show you around.

1231
01:00:33,791 --> 01:00:36,375
More of a Motorola guy, but fuck yourself.

1232
01:00:41,416 --> 01:00:44,250
<i>Attention.
Lottery ends in four hours.</i>

1233
01:00:44,333 --> 01:00:47,083
Oh. This is where you keep
all the good-looking people.

1234
01:00:47,166 --> 01:00:50,541
- Sure is.
- Not all the good-looking people.

1235
01:00:50,625 --> 01:00:52,375
You're good-looking.

1236
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,375
Pity shoulder pat... that's brutal.

1237
01:00:56,458 --> 01:00:58,125
That is our wall of winners.

1238
01:00:59,791 --> 01:01:02,476
In a few hours, your face...
... is gonna go right there.

1239
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,291
It's been a while since the last one, huh?

1240
01:01:04,375 --> 01:01:06,375
Yeah. Well, you know,

1241
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:09,208
half the jackpots these days
are so desperate,

1242
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:11,976
they decide to risk keeping the commission
rather than letting us save their lives.

1243
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,333
Now, we charge 30% here,

1244
01:01:13,416 --> 01:01:15,291
which sounds like a lot, I know,

1245
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:18,125
but, uh, we also have
the highest rate of survival in the city.

1246
01:01:18,208 --> 01:01:19,458
Sir?

1247
01:01:19,541 --> 01:01:21,208
Thank you.

1248
01:01:21,291 --> 01:01:23,083
So, what do you say, Katie Kim?

1249
01:01:23,166 --> 01:01:26,041
Can we officially make you a billionaire?

1250
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:28,916
Without that Phone Strike,
we'd be dead meat.

1251
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,291
So, they do deliver.

1252
01:01:32,333 --> 01:01:34,541
What percentage does Noel get?

1253
01:01:35,583 --> 01:01:37,166
Sorry, Noel?

1254
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:40,458
Yeah. He saved me way before
you guys entered the picture.

1255
01:01:40,541 --> 01:01:42,083
Yeah, I'll tell you what.

1256
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:46,166
We would be happy to give Noel
five percent of our commission.

1257
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:47,541
Five percent?

1258
01:01:47,625 --> 01:01:50,416
Wow, waiters must love you.

1259
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,458
- Fifty percent.
- Katie, that's...

1260
01:01:52,541 --> 01:01:53,750
Fifty percent.

1261
01:01:53,833 --> 01:01:56,583
Uh... okay.

1262
01:01:56,666 --> 01:01:58,625
Tell you what.

1263
01:01:58,708 --> 01:02:02,125
I think it's only fair that Noel receive
the same commission that we charge.

1264
01:02:02,208 --> 01:02:04,166
- Thirty percent.
- Say-say what?

1265
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:05,708
Say 30%.

1266
01:02:05,791 --> 01:02:07,166
How's that sound?

1267
01:02:14,708 --> 01:02:16,666
Excellent. Wonderful.

1268
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:18,500
You made the right choice today, Katie.

1269
01:02:18,583 --> 01:02:21,708
I know that every single agent,
myself especially,

1270
01:02:21,791 --> 01:02:23,625
we're all here to kick butt
on your behalf.

1271
01:02:23,708 --> 01:02:29,208
Really? Because you look more ready
to challenge Celine Dion to a sing-off.

1272
01:02:29,291 --> 01:02:31,976
Well, I did always have trouble
hitting the high note in "All By Myself,"

1273
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,083
but, uh, I reckon I could blow
her face off pretty good with these.

1274
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:37,291
Slimline grenades.

1275
01:02:37,375 --> 01:02:39,750
You're safe with us. I guarantee it.

1276
01:02:40,833 --> 01:02:42,458
Come on.

1277
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:43,625
You can come, too, Noel.

1278
01:02:46,833 --> 01:02:48,750
Come on, Noel. What are you doing?

1279
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:52,750
Your fans are very smart, Katie.

1280
01:02:52,833 --> 01:02:54,642
They don't wait for your location
to be posted.

1281
01:02:54,666 --> 01:02:56,208
They just follow the drone.

1282
01:02:56,291 --> 01:02:59,666
I feel like you might want to use
a different word than "fans."

1283
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:01,559
Well, they're rabid,
I'll tell you that.

1284
01:03:01,583 --> 01:03:03,642
And they want to get me almost as bad
as they want to get you

1285
01:03:03,666 --> 01:03:05,142
since I'm standing in the way
of their money.

1286
01:03:05,166 --> 01:03:08,083
We can hold them off here for a while
but, uh, not indefinitely.

1287
01:03:08,166 --> 01:03:09,291
What?

1288
01:03:09,375 --> 01:03:12,166
What, you build a bunker like this
and you skimp on the windows?

1289
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:15,791
Well, when the pot is $3.6 billion, Noel,
we don't take any chances.

1290
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,250
That's why we're the best.

1291
01:03:17,333 --> 01:03:18,375
Makes sense.

1292
01:03:18,458 --> 01:03:19,708
All right, so here's the deal.

1293
01:03:19,791 --> 01:03:21,934
First, we'll dispatch a fleet
of autonomous decoy vehicles.

1294
01:03:21,958 --> 01:03:24,142
Most of your fans will follow those,
thinking you're in one of them.

1295
01:03:24,166 --> 01:03:26,142
Once they do, we'll exfiltrate you
in a different vehicle

1296
01:03:26,166 --> 01:03:28,000
to a hidden underground fortress,

1297
01:03:28,083 --> 01:03:30,250
and, uh, from there,
you're home free, Richie Rich.

1298
01:03:31,375 --> 01:03:33,041
Isabella's going to take care of you.

1299
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:35,375
Miss Kim, follow me.

1300
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:38,000
Oh, and, uh, Isabella,
why don't we make sure

1301
01:03:38,083 --> 01:03:41,625
that Miss Kim gets an outfit
that's, uh, not visible from space.

1302
01:03:41,708 --> 01:03:43,500
I-I don't normally dress like this.

1303
01:03:43,583 --> 01:03:45,458
We probably shop at the same store.

1304
01:03:45,541 --> 01:03:48,875
My comfort zone is dressing
like a husky tween.

1305
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:50,267
Okay.

1306
01:03:50,291 --> 01:03:52,101
<i>Agent Ash,
call on line three.</i>

1307
01:03:52,125 --> 01:03:54,750
Louis, uh, I just wanted to say
it was really decent

1308
01:03:54,833 --> 01:03:56,226
what you did back there, cutting me in.

1309
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,458
You did not have to do that.

1310
01:03:57,541 --> 01:03:58,708
I know.

1311
01:03:58,791 --> 01:04:00,583
Thank you.

1312
01:04:00,666 --> 01:04:02,875
I, uh, hope the past
is just water under the bridge.

1313
01:04:02,958 --> 01:04:05,666
Hey, we're cool.

1314
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:07,458
All right?

1315
01:04:07,541 --> 01:04:09,083
It's good to see you.

1316
01:04:09,166 --> 01:04:11,791
Would you do me a favor,
just fix yourself up a little bit.

1317
01:04:11,875 --> 01:04:15,750
You look like Wreck-It Ralph after
a 14-hour cocaine bender. Geez.

1318
01:04:16,875 --> 01:04:18,208
You look like...

1319
01:04:18,291 --> 01:04:19,916
Fuck.

1320
01:04:22,166 --> 01:04:24,416
Wow, this is how
the other half lives, huh?

1321
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:27,208
My doctor's office is in a strip mall
next to an El Pollo Loco.

1322
01:04:27,291 --> 01:04:28,708
Ow! Oh.

1323
01:04:28,791 --> 01:04:31,471
I hope my health care pays for this.
Just kidding, I don't have any.

1324
01:04:32,458 --> 01:04:34,541
- Um, can I ask you something?
- Shoot.

1325
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,958
You been doing this a long time?

1326
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:39,250
A while.

1327
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:41,416
You save a lot of people?

1328
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:43,500
A few.

1329
01:04:43,583 --> 01:04:45,375
Then what do you spend your money on?

1330
01:04:45,458 --> 01:04:49,583
Because, um, well, I can tell that you-you
might not be spending it on yourself.

1331
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:50,916
Excuse me?

1332
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,934
For starters, you dress like a gym teacher
at a funeral.

1333
01:04:52,958 --> 01:04:55,041
I was voted Best Dressed my senior year.

1334
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:56,666
Ah, so you were homeschooled?

1335
01:04:57,958 --> 01:05:00,142
- And you clearly cut your own hair.
- My grandmother cuts my hair.

1336
01:05:00,166 --> 01:05:02,708
I'm just saying, it's...
it's dangerous work.

1337
01:05:02,791 --> 01:05:07,791
And anyone with their head screwed on
right would make their money and stop.

1338
01:05:07,875 --> 01:05:10,958
So, uh, well, why haven't you?

1339
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:12,166
Thanks.

1340
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:13,750
That's a fair question.

1341
01:05:15,833 --> 01:05:17,125
Um...

1342
01:05:17,208 --> 01:05:19,500
I used to be a mercenary, private sector.

1343
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:20,833
With Louis.

1344
01:05:20,916 --> 01:05:25,500
Our unit got sent all around the world
to do bad things to bad people.

1345
01:05:25,583 --> 01:05:27,916
And we weren't paid to ask any questions.

1346
01:05:29,166 --> 01:05:30,541
One day, I did,

1347
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:33,500
and I found out some of those people
weren't as bad as they say.

1348
01:05:34,666 --> 01:05:37,250
I tried to convince Louis.
He wouldn't listen.

1349
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:38,583
So I just bailed.

1350
01:05:38,666 --> 01:05:40,708
Right there in the middle of a job, but...

1351
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:44,666
...because I wasn't there,
the mission went sideways,

1352
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:46,375
and, uh, my unit...

1353
01:05:48,958 --> 01:05:51,458
Louis and I are the only survivors.

1354
01:05:53,666 --> 01:05:57,041
So the money I make, my ten percent,
uh, goes to their families

1355
01:05:57,125 --> 01:05:59,000
and the families of the good people
we hurt.

1356
01:06:00,083 --> 01:06:01,166
Oh.

1357
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,875
Wow. That's heavy.

1358
01:06:04,958 --> 01:06:06,041
You know what?

1359
01:06:06,125 --> 01:06:07,805
Because of what you negotiated with Louis,

1360
01:06:07,833 --> 01:06:10,166
they are gonna be getting
a whole lot more now, so...

1361
01:06:11,333 --> 01:06:13,458
...thank you.

1362
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:18,875
M... my dad was my manager.

1363
01:06:18,958 --> 01:06:21,375
He had me working my ass off
since I was eight years old.

1364
01:06:21,458 --> 01:06:23,666
And then, on my 18th birthday,

1365
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:28,500
I tell him I want to take charge
of my own time

1366
01:06:28,583 --> 01:06:30,583
and my own money.

1367
01:06:32,041 --> 01:06:34,333
And he said...

1368
01:06:34,416 --> 01:06:38,125
"Okay, sweetheart.
I'll take care of you. Trust me."

1369
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:41,625
Then the next morning, he's gone.

1370
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:44,625
He took every cent I ever earned,

1371
01:06:44,708 --> 01:06:46,666
left me and my mom high and dry.

1372
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:48,916
Then my mom got sick

1373
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,291
and I had to quit to take care of her
because no one else would.

1374
01:06:53,375 --> 01:06:55,583
She finally died a month ago.

1375
01:06:56,875 --> 01:07:00,791
Left me with $600
and a bus ticket to L.A., so...

1376
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:03,375
here I am now...

1377
01:07:03,458 --> 01:07:04,625
trying to start over.

1378
01:07:04,708 --> 01:07:06,125
Katie, I am...

1379
01:07:06,208 --> 01:07:09,666
I-I'm not trying to compete
with your story. Um...

1380
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:13,458
I'm just explaining that my own father

1381
01:07:13,541 --> 01:07:18,291
didn't hesitate for a second to choose
money over me and my mom, so...

1382
01:07:18,375 --> 01:07:20,083
how was I supposed to trust you?

1383
01:07:22,708 --> 01:07:24,041
Sure.

1384
01:07:24,125 --> 01:07:27,208
But I do trust you, Noel.

1385
01:07:27,291 --> 01:07:29,750
For some weird reason, I-I do.

1386
01:07:31,333 --> 01:07:33,666
I think it's because you look
like a bulldog

1387
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:36,000
that, like, a witch cast a spell on...

1388
01:07:36,083 --> 01:07:38,166
...and turned into a human,
like, against his will.

1389
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:39,892
You ever get that?

1390
01:07:39,916 --> 01:07:41,000
Yes.

1391
01:07:43,708 --> 01:07:46,625
Miss Kim, please put your face right here.

1392
01:07:46,708 --> 01:07:48,916
This is a prosthetics machine.

1393
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,750
Go ahead and pick any face you'd like.

1394
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:52,250
Oh, cool.

1395
01:07:52,333 --> 01:07:55,333
It's just an extra added layer
of protection for when you're in transit.

1396
01:07:55,416 --> 01:07:57,541
If people can't recognize you,
you're a lot safer.

1397
01:07:57,625 --> 01:07:59,745
Oh, my God.
There are so many different faces.

1398
01:08:01,166 --> 01:08:02,583
Cool, cool.

1399
01:08:02,666 --> 01:08:04,166
Oh, I like this one.

1400
01:08:09,958 --> 01:08:12,166
Oh. Oh.

1401
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:14,041
This is, it's weird in here.

1402
01:08:14,125 --> 01:08:16,083
It's crazy.

1403
01:08:16,166 --> 01:08:18,541
Um, hey, Noel?

1404
01:08:18,625 --> 01:08:20,500
- Yeah?
- Why'd you get so upset earlier

1405
01:08:20,583 --> 01:08:22,958
when you were asking Louis
for help in the panic room?

1406
01:08:23,041 --> 01:08:25,101
Is it 'cause you didn't want to lose out
on commission?

1407
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:26,208
Oh, come on, no.

1408
01:08:26,291 --> 01:08:28,267
There's a lot of bad blood between us
after what happened, okay?

1409
01:08:28,291 --> 01:08:30,833
I hated that I needed him.

1410
01:08:30,916 --> 01:08:33,458
But he seems to be past it, so...

1411
01:08:33,541 --> 01:08:35,958
I will suck it up as long as it helps you.

1412
01:08:36,041 --> 01:08:37,958
He's definitely
still a dick to you.

1413
01:08:38,041 --> 01:08:39,416
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1414
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:40,958
That's Louis.

1415
01:08:41,041 --> 01:08:44,333
That's why I was so surprised
when he caved in on the 30%.

1416
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:47,583
Not like the old Louis, but I mean,
people change, right?

1417
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:50,208
Oh, yeah,
I've found that not to be the case.

1418
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:52,208
I mean, do you really trust him?

1419
01:08:52,291 --> 01:08:55,083
Our lives are literally
in his hands right now.

1420
01:08:58,083 --> 01:09:00,375
Hey, girl, hey.

1421
01:09:00,458 --> 01:09:02,333
What? Too sexy?

1422
01:09:03,416 --> 01:09:04,958
Let's go pee standing up

1423
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:07,441
and make more money
than our female counterparts, am I right?

1424
01:09:08,833 --> 01:09:10,541
What's wrong?

1425
01:09:10,625 --> 01:09:14,041
This, this equipment, staff, the facility.

1426
01:09:14,125 --> 01:09:15,791
Those are huge expenses.

1427
01:09:15,875 --> 01:09:18,083
And moving out of this bunker
doesn't make sense.

1428
01:09:18,166 --> 01:09:20,500
You saw how long it's been
since they had a jackpot.

1429
01:09:20,583 --> 01:09:22,851
And the ones they had before, that weren't
that big, not big enough for all this.

1430
01:09:22,875 --> 01:09:24,083
So you think it's a setup?

1431
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:26,142
- I don't know.
- What don't you know, Noel?

1432
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:28,416
Um... why I just farted.

1433
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:29,916
It's probably the muscle relaxants.

1434
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,666
Nothing loosens a sphincter faster.

1435
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:33,226
And since I know what Noel usually eats,

1436
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:35,750
I'd say it's best we get the hell
out of here ASAP.

1437
01:09:35,833 --> 01:09:37,083
Shall we?

1438
01:09:37,166 --> 01:09:38,791
Yes.

1439
01:09:38,875 --> 01:09:41,416
As long as you're ready, Noel.

1440
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:43,875
Oh, uh, yeah, yeah, we should go.

1441
01:09:43,958 --> 01:09:46,000
That's a strong look, by the way, Katie.

1442
01:09:46,083 --> 01:09:47,851
Not many women could pull off
a goatee like that.

1443
01:09:47,875 --> 01:09:49,250
- Oh.
- Dig it.

1444
01:09:49,333 --> 01:09:51,500
Thank you.

1445
01:09:54,916 --> 01:09:58,250
Hey, Louis, uh, you sure it's a good idea
to move her out of here?

1446
01:09:58,333 --> 01:09:59,851
I mean, this place seems really secure.

1447
01:09:59,875 --> 01:10:02,541
Oh, if people know where she is,
then it's not secure, is it, Noel?

1448
01:10:02,625 --> 01:10:04,351
You're not questioning my expertise,
are you?

1449
01:10:04,375 --> 01:10:06,958
No. No, Louis, you know me.
Always looking for a way out.

1450
01:10:07,041 --> 01:10:08,559
Ain't that the truth.

1451
01:10:08,583 --> 01:10:10,875
<i>Attention.
Lottery ends in three hours.</i>

1452
01:10:10,958 --> 01:10:12,226
Okay, we're in trouble, aren't we?

1453
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:13,583
Yes, we are.

1454
01:10:13,666 --> 01:10:15,392
I could never figure out
why more than half the players

1455
01:10:15,416 --> 01:10:17,416
that killed jackpots this year
requested anonymity.

1456
01:10:17,458 --> 01:10:19,666
Now it makes sense.

1457
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:22,375
I think that Louis
has been murdering his clients.

1458
01:10:22,458 --> 01:10:23,875
Wait, what? No.

1459
01:10:23,958 --> 01:10:27,041
Why would he do all that,
the-the decoy cars, the disguises?

1460
01:10:27,125 --> 01:10:28,500
He patched up our wounds.

1461
01:10:28,583 --> 01:10:31,101
I know, he has to. He has to make it look
like the agency's doing their job.

1462
01:10:31,125 --> 01:10:33,791
That way, the next jackpot does
the same thing that we did:

1463
01:10:33,875 --> 01:10:36,333
walk right in here
and look for his protection.

1464
01:10:36,416 --> 01:10:38,333
Katie, we're in a honey trap.

1465
01:10:38,416 --> 01:10:39,958
Oh, shit.

1466
01:10:40,041 --> 01:10:41,500
Hmm? What?

1467
01:10:42,583 --> 01:10:44,625
Noel sharted.

1468
01:10:44,708 --> 01:10:46,559
Noel, buddy,
would you squeeze your asshole shut

1469
01:10:46,583 --> 01:10:48,125
and hold it in like a fucking man.

1470
01:10:48,208 --> 01:10:49,208
Seriously.

1471
01:10:49,291 --> 01:10:52,083
- What do we do?
- I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

1472
01:10:52,166 --> 01:10:54,375
Just give me a second.

1473
01:10:56,041 --> 01:10:57,291
See that, Noel?

1474
01:10:57,375 --> 01:10:59,958
A big breachable door
with a bloodthirsty mob behind it.

1475
01:11:00,041 --> 01:11:02,625
Too risky.
Told you I knew what I was talking about.

1476
01:11:02,708 --> 01:11:05,458
Well, Katie Kim, your chariot awaits.

1477
01:11:05,541 --> 01:11:07,892
Just hop on in and we'll dispatch
the decoys from the main exit

1478
01:11:07,916 --> 01:11:10,250
to clear the door and, uh,
get you out of here to safety.

1479
01:11:10,333 --> 01:11:12,041
This way, Miss Kim.

1480
01:11:12,125 --> 01:11:14,416
Noel, you're gonna ride with us.

1481
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:15,500
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no.

1482
01:11:15,583 --> 01:11:17,791
Uh, uh, you know,
I'd really prefer to stick with Noel.

1483
01:11:17,875 --> 01:11:19,083
If that's cool.

1484
01:11:19,166 --> 01:11:21,250
- You're much safer with us.
- Sure.

1485
01:11:21,333 --> 01:11:24,791
Uh, but it just...
and-and I don't want to mansplain...

1486
01:11:24,875 --> 01:11:28,375
uh, it's just that he saved my life
four times today.

1487
01:11:28,458 --> 01:11:30,833
And he's kind of a lucky rabbit's foot,

1488
01:11:30,916 --> 01:11:33,125
except he's the size of 80 of them.

1489
01:11:33,208 --> 01:11:34,958
Look, I know we all love big,
dumb animals,

1490
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:39,333
but as the guy who just saved you
and that just a moment ago,

1491
01:11:39,416 --> 01:11:41,666
I'm asking that you give us a shot.

1492
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:43,875
Um, I don't know.
I think we should just stay here

1493
01:11:43,958 --> 01:11:46,708
'cause that door seems, like,
really strong and, like...

1494
01:11:46,791 --> 01:11:48,291
Katie...

1495
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:50,416
I'm not going to let anything bad
happen to you.

1496
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,166
Okay?

1497
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:54,541
I'll take care of you, sweetheart.

1498

Trust me.

1499

01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,583
<i>Yeah, fuck this guy.</i>

1576
01:15:48,666 --> 01:15:50,333
<i>What's it gonna be, Katie, huh?</i>

1577
01:15:53,125 --> 01:15:55,500
Okay, all right, I-I'll turn around.

1578
01:15:55,583 --> 01:15:57,250
<i>- No!
- That's a good girl.</i>

1579
01:15:57,333 --> 01:15:59,375
<i>Now show me.
I want to see you turn the car around.</i>

1580
01:15:59,458 --> 01:16:00,750
I'm doing it.

1581
01:16:08,291 --> 01:16:09,517
<i>All right, I'll drop you a pin.</i>

1582
01:16:09,541 --> 01:16:11,875
<i>I know a nice quiet place
where your fans won't find you.</i>

1583
01:16:11,958 --> 01:16:15,208
<i>If you're not there in 24 minutes,
well, the next time you see Noel's face</i>

1584
01:16:15,291 --> 01:16:18,458
<i>will be when I mail you his fucking head!</i>

1585
01:16:18,541 --> 01:16:19,583
<i>'Kay, bye.</i>

1586
01:16:23,083 --> 01:16:24,916
Oh, man, fucking Noel.

1587
01:16:29,541 --> 01:16:31,666
Oh, you really think nobody's
gonna find her in here?

1588
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:34,101
Of course not. Nobody gives a shit
about theater in Los Angeles.

1589
01:16:34,125 --> 01:16:36,166
I do.
I saw the last performance here.

1590
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:37,625
<i>Other Space: The Hip Hop Musical.</i>

1591
01:16:37,708 --> 01:16:38,750
Vin Diesel was amazing.

1592
01:16:38,833 --> 01:16:40,708
Shut the fuck up.

1593
01:16:42,375 --> 01:16:44,291
- She's smarter than you think, Louis.
- Really?

1594
01:16:44,375 --> 01:16:47,184
She's a wannabe actress who moved to L.A.
expecting to have a good experience.

1595
01:16:47,208 --> 01:16:48,568
Yeah, she's a real fucking genius.

1596
01:16:48,625 --> 01:16:51,125
Okay, so you're gonna kill
an innocent woman for what?

1597
01:16:51,208 --> 01:16:53,489
'Cause your fucking bozos
bought too many cases of LaCroix

1598
01:16:53,541 --> 01:16:54,833
for your executive lounge?

1599
01:16:54,916 --> 01:16:56,309
Don't pretend like you don't LaCroix.

1600
01:16:56,333 --> 01:16:57,767
It tastes like a drawing of a coconut.

1601
01:16:57,791 --> 01:16:58,916
Coconut is the worst flavor!

1602
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,333
You cannot judge it based on coconut!

1603
01:17:01,416 --> 01:17:03,916
It's a delicious zero-calorie beverage.

1604
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,517
I'm tired of people shitting on LaCroix.

1605
01:17:07,708 --> 01:17:10,083
See, this is exactly why no one wants
to work with you, man.

1606
01:17:10,166 --> 01:17:13,375
You talk about these jackpots
like they're, like they're fucking people.

1607
01:17:13,458 --> 01:17:15,166
They're big walking ATMs.

1608
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:18,291
And this one is the biggest
fucking ATM of all time.

1609
01:17:18,375 --> 01:17:21,541
You really are a reprehensible
chunk of wet shit, Louis.

1610
01:17:21,625 --> 01:17:23,625
Oh, grow the fuck up, you dick stain.

1611
01:17:23,708 --> 01:17:26,041
How do you think the world works? Huh?

1612
01:17:26,125 --> 01:17:28,833
It runs on money.

1613
01:17:28,916 --> 01:17:30,958
You know the mission that you bailed on?

1614
01:17:31,041 --> 01:17:33,666
Now, that... that was a fucking jackpot.

1615
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:36,291
That family was guarding millions in gold
for those warlords.

1616
01:17:36,375 --> 01:17:37,833
That money changed my life.

1617
01:17:37,916 --> 01:17:39,809
You never should have gone in there
knowing what we knew.

1618
01:17:39,833 --> 01:17:41,226
You got all our men killed without me.

1619
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:42,791
We didn't need you.

1620
01:17:42,875 --> 01:17:45,291
There was no danger in that raid,
you dumb fuck.

1621
01:17:45,375 --> 01:17:48,375
There were no fighters around for miles,
no one in the house was even armed.

1622
01:17:48,958 --> 01:17:50,559
It was the easiest fucking job of my life.

1623
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:54,166
Just walked in, took out the family,
grabbed the jackpot.

1624
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:56,208
Th-There was no firefight?

1625
01:17:57,291 --> 01:17:59,458
Let's just say I don't like to share.

1626
01:18:01,708 --> 01:18:03,583
You killed our team for gold?

1627
01:18:03,666 --> 01:18:05,000
Yeah, I did, Noel.

1628
01:18:05,083 --> 01:18:07,541
It's just business, okay?

1629
01:18:07,625 --> 01:18:09,142
High-stakes business, winner take all.

1630
01:18:09,166 --> 01:18:10,375
Welcome to the real world.

1631
01:18:11,916 --> 01:18:13,625
You evil fucking son of a bitch.

1632
01:18:13,708 --> 01:18:16,000
Oh, compliments will get you
nowhere with me.

1633
01:18:16,083 --> 01:18:17,791
Yeah.

1634
01:18:17,875 --> 01:18:20,458
<i>- Sir.</i>
- Have the team rally on my position.

1635
01:18:20,541 --> 01:18:22,583
It's time to close this account.

1636
01:18:30,458 --> 01:18:32,333
Stupid Noel.

1637
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:35,916
Why couldn't you have just been
a fucking asshole like everybody else?

1638
01:18:38,583 --> 01:18:40,041
Watch the clock.

1639
01:18:40,125 --> 01:18:42,325
You kill her one second after the bell,
you get no money

1640
01:18:42,375 --> 01:18:43,708
and you get a murder charge.

1641
01:18:43,791 --> 01:18:46,750
So we go fucking fast
and we go fucking hard.

1642
01:18:52,958 --> 01:18:55,250
Where do these guys keep their guns...

1643
01:18:55,333 --> 01:18:57,208
grenades...

1644
01:18:57,291 --> 01:18:59,083
Bingo.

1645
01:19:00,583 --> 01:19:03,000
Looks like a fucking SpongeBob gun.

1646
01:19:16,666 --> 01:19:18,875
Katie Kim.

1647
01:19:20,208 --> 01:19:21,583
Center stage.

1648
01:19:21,666 --> 01:19:25,458
That's a... deadly-looking weapon
you got there.

1649
01:19:25,541 --> 01:19:27,666
What's the range on that thing,
like two inches?

1650
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:28,916
I'm shaking.

1651
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,250
Let him go.

1652
01:19:32,625 --> 01:19:37,375
You literally have
zero leverage here, so no.

1653
01:19:37,458 --> 01:19:40,208
I don't know, I have a little.

1654
01:19:40,291 --> 01:19:41,583
Oh, yeah?

1655
01:19:41,666 --> 01:19:44,166
See, you get all the money if you kill me,

1656
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:49,000
but what happens if...

1657
01:19:49,083 --> 01:19:50,500
I do it myself?

1658
01:19:51,583 --> 01:19:53,416
- Katie.
- Let him go.

1659
01:19:54,625 --> 01:19:58,458
You expect me to believe
that you would kill yourself

1660
01:19:58,541 --> 01:20:00,791
for this guy?

1661
01:20:02,375 --> 01:20:04,250
You met him, what, four hours ago?

1662
01:20:04,333 --> 01:20:05,750
I said let him go.

1663
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:07,333
Uh-uh, nope.

1664
01:20:07,416 --> 01:20:08,916
Not buying it.

1665
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,500
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit?

1666
01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:13,333
I'm gonna die anyway, right?

1667
01:20:14,875 --> 01:20:17,500
So the only choice that I have left

1668
01:20:17,583 --> 01:20:20,208
is whether or not I want you to be rich
because of it.

1669
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:24,708
Let him go.

1670
01:20:26,083 --> 01:20:27,375
Go ahead.

1671
01:20:27,458 --> 01:20:29,458
No, go ahead. Pop your own skull.

1672
01:20:29,541 --> 01:20:33,291
I'll just wipe your prints off
the bolt gun and tell them I did it.

1673
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:35,416
Not with a million of my fans watching.

1674
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,125
Fuck.

1675
01:20:37,208 --> 01:20:39,125
Oh, shit.

1676
01:20:39,208 --> 01:20:41,416
You're crazy, Katie Kim.

1677
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:43,541
What do I have to live for anyway?

1678
01:20:43,625 --> 01:20:45,208
I got no friends.

1679
01:20:45,291 --> 01:20:47,208
I got no family.

1680
01:20:47,291 --> 01:20:50,041
Everybody fucking sucks.

1681
01:20:50,125 --> 01:20:53,291
I came to this town
chasing a stupid dream that,

1682
01:20:53,375 --> 01:20:55,500
deep down, I know won't happen.

1683
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:57,125
Not for me.

1684
01:20:57,208 --> 01:20:59,708
And you're right, I did meet him today.

1685
01:20:59,791 --> 01:21:01,250
Today.

1686
01:21:01,333 --> 01:21:04,208
And that's the best relationship
I have in my life.

1687
01:21:04,291 --> 01:21:06,875
Isn't that fucking pathetic?

1688
01:21:09,666 --> 01:21:12,041
Aren't I fucking pathetic?

1689
01:21:12,125 --> 01:21:14,791
Katie, don't do this. Please.

1690
01:21:16,333 --> 01:21:18,500
Why keep pretending
things are gonna go my way?

1691
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:21,750
So let's just fucking do this.

1692
01:21:21,833 --> 01:21:24,666
Fuck you and fuck your money.

1693
01:21:27,208 --> 01:21:29,833
No, no, no, no, no, stop, stop.

1694
01:21:29,916 --> 01:21:31,791
Okay, okay.

1695
01:21:32,875 --> 01:21:34,708
I'll let him go.

1696
01:21:40,875 --> 01:21:42,916
Okay, now give me the gun.

1697
01:21:48,958 --> 01:21:50,291
Okay.

1698
01:21:50,375 --> 01:21:51,625
You win.

1699
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:54,541
That's a good girl.

1700
01:21:55,625 --> 01:21:57,791
Push kick!

1701
01:22:00,875 --> 01:22:03,208
Acting, motherfucker.

1702
01:22:06,250 --> 01:22:08,166
Bravo.

1703
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:10,666
Daniel Day-Lewis wishes he had your range.

1704
01:22:13,583 --> 01:22:16,291

01:23:27,958 --> 01:23:29,833
No!

1733
01:23:29,916 --> 01:23:31,601
Where do you think you're going,
you little shit?

1734
01:23:36,416 --> 01:23:38,166
You're a loser with no friends.

1735
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:40,166
What do you even need that money for?

1736
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:43,410
What are you going to do with the money,
buy more white suits, you fucking diva?

1737
01:23:44,125 --> 01:23:45,791
Fucking die.

1738
01:23:46,458 --> 01:23:48,708
Oh, shit.

1739
01:23:49,333 --> 01:23:50,875
Fuck off, mall cop.

1740
01:23:53,833 --> 01:23:55,458
No.

1741
01:23:57,333 --> 01:23:59,041
Oh, shit.

1742
01:24:05,041 --> 01:24:06,851
Ah, fuck this.

1743
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:08,875
It's Turtle time, motherfuckers.

1744
01:24:08,958 --> 01:24:10,083

1755
01:24:37,375 --> 01:24:39,125
[screaming

1756
01:24:39,208 --> 01:24:41,000
Fucking psycho! Ah!

1757
01:24:45,291 --> 01:24:47,250
- A little help, please.
- Ow!

1758
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:49,208
I'm on it.

1759
01:24:49,291 --> 01:24:50,625
No, no!

1760
01:24:51,958 --> 01:24:53,458
Finally.

1761
01:24:54,291 --> 01:24:55,958
Where you going, Katie?

1762
01:24:57,708 --> 01:24:59,333
Katie, run.

1763
01:25:02,875 --> 01:25:05,708
My ticket, my jackpot.

1764
01:25:05,791 --> 01:25:07,791
Well, I gave you one star on Airbnb.

1765
01:25:07,875 --> 01:25:09,541
Now you'll never be a Superhost.

1766
01:25:09,625 --> 01:25:11,791
Not cool.

1767
01:25:12,708 --> 01:25:14,291
Oh, I'm going to enjoy this.

1768
01:25:14,375 --> 01:25:16,333
No, I'm going to enjoy this.

1769
01:25:17,875 --> 01:25:19,166
Shit.

1770
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:24,166
You're fucking with my money, Noel.

1771
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:25,875
Bye!

1772
01:25:27,041 --> 01:25:28,791
Owie, owie, owie, owie, I'm sorry.

1773
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:29,916
No.

1774
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Wait. Remember all the good times
we've had?

1775
01:25:32,083 --> 01:25:33,833
Like when my roof leaked
human shit on you?

1776
01:25:33,916 --> 01:25:35,458
That was hilarious.

1777
01:25:35,541 --> 01:25:37,000
Call your fucking mom back.

1778
01:25:39,041 --> 01:25:41,750
God, I should've just stabbed you.

1779
01:25:59,875 --> 01:26:01,541
Katie, four minutes. Climb!

1780
01:26:02,333 --> 01:26:04,166
Oh, God.

1781
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:16,000
Let me take that off your hands,
Van Damme.

1782
01:26:23,541 --> 01:26:25,916
Looks like it's showtime, motherfucker.

1783
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,267
Uh, excuse me, can I borrow that?

1784
01:26:27,291 --> 01:26:28,375
Maybe, can I...

1785
01:26:30,833 --> 01:26:33,250
Yes. Oh, shit.

1786
01:26:34,208 --> 01:26:36,583
Huh. After this, there's an oboe
going right up your ass.

1787
01:27:10,416 --> 01:27:12,333
Hi, Miss Kim. Good to see you again.

1788
01:27:12,416 --> 01:27:13,250
What?

1789
01:27:13,333 --> 01:27:15,916
Your watch keeps terrible time.

1790
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,916
Oh, let me reset it for you.

1791
01:27:20,583 --> 01:27:21,708
Ouch.

1792
01:27:25,166 --> 01:27:27,375
- You know what? Good to see you're okay.
- Ow!

1793
01:27:27,458 --> 01:27:29,125
Excuse me.

1794
01:27:34,458 --> 01:27:35,500
Katie, two minutes!

1795
01:27:54,291 --> 01:27:56,041
Whoa.

1796
01:28:07,708 --> 01:28:09,291
I'm coming, Katie. No!

1797
01:28:14,791 --> 01:28:17,291
Where do you think you're going,
Katie Kim?

1798
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:18,833
Shit.

1799
01:28:25,875 --> 01:28:26,916
Hey, Katie, girl.

1800
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,040
- Uh-huh, you're a horrible actress!
- Go on, bitch.

1801
01:28:38,708 --> 01:28:40,166
Katie, stay away from him!

1802
01:28:46,958 --> 01:28:48,583
Oh. Ow.

1803
01:28:48,666 --> 01:28:50,208
Where you going?

1804
01:28:57,416 --> 01:29:00,000
You're doing a terrible job
of protecting me.

1805
01:29:00,083 --> 01:29:01,666
I think I'm gonna have to let you go.

1806
01:29:03,458 --> 01:29:05,375
Katie, 60 seconds!

1807
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,750
Shit.

1808
01:29:10,708 --> 01:29:14,041
Keep going, Spaghetti Squares!

1809
01:29:20,875 --> 01:29:22,166
I've got to say, Katie,

1810
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:26,083
two people of proud Asian heritage
trying to kill each other for money...

1811
01:29:26,166 --> 01:29:27,750
very inspiring.

1812
01:29:31,583 --> 01:29:32,958
Leave her alone, Louis!

1813
01:29:40,833 --> 01:29:41,958
No!

1814
01:29:48,291 --> 01:29:49,541
Oh, I'm sorry, Katie.

1815
01:29:49,625 --> 01:29:51,892
Looks like you don't have what it takes
to get out of this now.

1816
01:29:51,916 --> 01:29:53,166
I do have one thing.

1817
01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:55,000
What's that, your little lucky charm?

1818
01:29:55,083 --> 01:29:56,333
Fast hands.

1819
01:29:57,375 --> 01:29:58,208
Wait.

1820
01:29:58,291 --> 01:30:00,916
Is that a grenade in your pocket,
or are you just happy to see me?

1821
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,125
Fuck me.

1839
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:16,083
You're off the clock, boys.
Your boss just blew up.

1840
01:31:16,166 --> 01:31:18,000
Oh, sorry, sir.

1841
01:31:18,083 --> 01:31:19,083
You did it!

1842
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,958
Ooh, you got a little bit of Louis
on you there.

1843
01:31:28,041 --> 01:31:30,833
Yeah, I think his, like, tooth
flew in my mouth.

1844
01:31:30,916 --> 01:31:32,958
Hey, um,

1845
01:31:33,041 --> 01:31:36,541
I don't know if you were still expecting
that 30%.

1846
01:31:36,625 --> 01:31:39,916
Come on. I'm a man of my word.
Ten percent.

1847
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,291
But I'm not a woman of my word,

1848
01:31:42,375 --> 01:31:45,708
so I hope you'll be happy with 50%.

1849
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:49,416
Just so you know,
I was gonna double-cross you.

1850
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:50,750
I just ran out of time.

1851
01:31:50,833 --> 01:31:52,250
No, you weren't.

1852
01:31:52,333 --> 01:31:55,041
'Cause you really are a nice guy.

1853
01:31:55,125 --> 01:31:57,041
And I trust you.

1854
01:32:00,833 --> 01:32:01,958
Over here.

1855
01:32:02,041 --> 01:32:03,041
I.D., please.

1856
01:32:03,125 --> 01:32:04,750
Oh.

1857
01:32:04,833 --> 01:32:06,166
Not my real height.

1858
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:07,916
Hey.

1859
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,416
You saved me.

1860
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:11,666
You saved me.

1861
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:13,625
The people with the sheet,
they helped a lot.

1862
01:32:13,708 --> 01:32:15,041
Yeah, they did. They helped.

1863
01:32:15,125 --> 01:32:17,000
And, hey, just so you know,

1864
01:32:17,083 --> 01:32:19,125
I think my mom would've really liked you.

1865
01:32:19,208 --> 01:32:21,541
Katie!

1866
01:32:21,625 --> 01:32:23,708
Hey. All right.

1867
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,750
Hey!

1868
01:32:26,833 --> 01:32:30,250
Congratulations, Katie Kim.

1869
01:32:30,333 --> 01:32:34,875
I'm Johnny Grand,
and you're our biggest jackpot winner yet.

1870
01:32:36,625 --> 01:32:41,208
{\an8}All right, so what are you going to do
now that you're a billionaire, Miss Kim?

1871
01:32:41,291 --> 01:32:43,791
{\an8}I'm gonna get the fuck out
of Los Angeles.

1872
01:32:43,875 --> 01:32:45,559
Ooh, watch the language.
There's kids watching.

1873
01:32:45,583 --> 01:32:46,958
{\an8}Sorry, children.

1874
01:32:47,041 --> 01:32:48,833
{\an8}All right, right this way
for an interview.

1875
01:32:48,916 --> 01:32:52,375
I think I've had enough publicity
for today, but thank you.

1876
01:32:52,458 --> 01:32:54,809
- No, the cameras...
- No. No, wait, wait. She said she'd had enough publicity.

1877
01:32:54,833 --> 01:32:56,642
If she doesn't want publicity,
that's her right.

1878
01:32:56,666 --> 01:32:58,517
- Hey, pal, it's live. It's live.
- Give her space.

1879
01:32:58,541 --> 01:33:00,184
Come back here,
we'll give you the check.

1880
01:33:00,208 --> 01:33:01,642
I thought all actors
wanted publicity.

1881
01:33:03,041 --> 01:33:04,434
I don't think I want to be
an actor anymore.

1882
01:33:04,458 --> 01:33:05,458
Yeah?

1883
01:33:05,541 --> 01:33:07,208
It's like, what's the point?

1884
01:33:07,291 --> 01:33:09,184
Fucking wrestlers and YouTubers
are movie stars now.

1885
01:33:09,208 --> 01:33:10,708
Yeah, I know, tell me about it.

1886
01:33:10,791 --> 01:33:13,083
Sort of makes it feel like
anybody can do it, right?

1887
01:33:14,833 --> 01:33:17,250
Hey, my last ten bucks.

1888
01:33:17,333 --> 01:33:18,708
Yeah, yeah.

1889
01:33:18,791 --> 01:33:20,083

01:39:32,791 --> 01:39:36,458
This is a guy that takes a dump
standing up.

2043
01:39:39,916 --> 01:39:41,625
<i>♪ Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah...</i>

2044
01:39:41,708 --> 01:39:43,583
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2045
01:39:43,666 --> 01:39:45,458
Oh, my God. That was really funny.

2046
01:39:46,875 --> 01:39:48,958
I once played <i>Tetris</i>
for about 65 hours straight.

2047
01:39:49,041 --> 01:39:50,375
I speak fluent Dothraki.

2048
01:39:50,458 --> 01:39:51,767
I don't know why I thought
that'd be useful.

2049
01:39:51,791 --> 01:39:53,142
I sucked my thumb for way too long,

2050
01:39:53,166 --> 01:39:55,208
and since my thumbs
are three times normal size,

2051
01:39:55,291 --> 01:39:56,750
my overbite was bananas.

2052
01:39:56,833 --> 01:39:58,267
I believe that Honeycomb
is the best cereal.

2053
01:39:58,291 --> 01:39:59,916
All other cereals are trash.

2054
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,208
Oh, I make my own socks.

2055
01:40:01,291 --> 01:40:04,541
My calves are always bursting
through the store-bought ones.

2056
01:40:04,625 --> 01:40:07,500
I estimated that I've eaten about
8,000 chickens in my life.

2057
01:40:07,583 --> 01:40:10,500
Oh, and I believe in aliens,
but I'm not a weirdo about it.

2058
01:40:10,583 --> 01:40:11,916
I once broke my femur.

2059
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,833
Still finished my shift at Baskin-Robbins.

2060
01:40:13,916 --> 01:40:16,000
31 flavors ain't gonna scoop themselves.

2061
01:40:16,083 --> 01:40:18,458
I nursed a baby squirrel
back to life once.

2062
01:40:18,541 --> 01:40:21,375
I fed it Muscle Milk in an eyedropper.

2063
01:40:21,458 --> 01:40:23,000
It was jacked.

2064
01:40:23,083 --> 01:40:24,791
You guys all named Riley? What?!

2065
01:40:29,708 --> 01:40:31,125
If you're not going to Comic Con,

why are you dressed like
the British robot from <i>Star Wars?</i>

2067
01:40:32,958 --> 01:40:35,791
No, I'm not C-3PO.

2068
01:40:35,875 --> 01:40:36,875
That's not his name.

2069
01:40:36,958 --> 01:40:39,166
Yeah, yes, it's definitely C-3PO.

2070
01:40:39,250 --> 01:40:41,541
No, it's definitely not
'cause I'd remember that.

2071
01:40:41,625 --> 01:40:43,833
Yeah, it's like Todd Beasley.

2072

'Ello. I'm Todd Beasley.

You'll be malfunctioning in a day,

that his name was C-3PO?

- That's not his name.
