1
00:03:26,515 --> 00:03:28,213
That's them in there
just like that?

2
00:03:29,605 --> 00:03:30,650
Just like that.

3
00:03:32,042 --> 00:03:34,001
I wouldn't go in there
for a day or two.

4
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,656
Heard the expression
kick the hornet's nest?

5
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,658
I'll stay right here.
Thank you.

6
00:03:39,267 --> 00:03:40,921
Those things
scare me to death.

7
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:42,314
They been killing
my honey bees.

8
00:03:43,315 --> 00:03:44,838
A few days unchecked,

9
00:03:44,838 --> 00:03:46,274
they'll wipe out
the whole colony.

10
00:03:46,274 --> 00:03:47,928
What are you gonna
do with them?

11
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:49,364
Well, that's between
me and them,

12
00:03:49,364 --> 00:03:50,409
if you don't mind.

13
00:03:51,584 --> 00:03:52,628
That's okay.

14
00:03:53,455 --> 00:03:54,891
I understand these things.

15
00:03:57,285 --> 00:03:59,113
I just wanted to thank you

16
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,072
for putting up with me,

17
00:04:03,726 --> 00:04:05,119
and all of my bees.

18
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:08,035
This place was crabgrass
and weeds,

19
00:04:08,035 --> 00:04:09,254
and you brought it
back to life.

20
00:04:10,472 --> 00:04:11,560
You're a blessing.

21
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:15,085
No one's ever
taken care of me before.

22
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:22,005
I'll, uh...

23
00:04:24,312 --> 00:04:25,487
Mr. Clay...

24
00:04:28,925 --> 00:04:30,971
Come back at suppertime.
Let me feed you.

25
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,649
- Boss.

26
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:42,129
You got something, yeah?
- I got one.

27
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:44,044
- I want it. I need it.

28
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,524
Hey, put it in my ear.

29
00:05:45,524 --> 00:05:48,353
Get this fucking
hippie shit down, please.

30
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,226
United Data Group.
Good afternoon. This is Boyd.

31
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,270
How may I help you?

32
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:55,142
Boyd.

33
00:05:55,142 --> 00:05:57,362
Uh, hello.
I just got a message saying

34
00:05:57,362 --> 00:05:59,364
that there's a problem
with my computer.

35
00:05:59,364 --> 00:06:01,148
<i>Don't you worry.
The message you received</i>

36
00:06:01,148 --> 00:06:03,368
<i>is from our United Data Group
antivirus software.</i>

37
00:06:03,368 --> 00:06:04,934
<i>It's part of
the software package</i>

38
00:06:04,934 --> 00:06:06,066
<i>that you pre-installed
on your computer.</i>

39
00:06:06,675 --> 00:06:08,721
I'm sorry.
I'm not a computer person.

40
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:10,723
What did you say the name
of your product is again?

41
00:06:17,556 --> 00:06:20,167
Now, our records show
that you actually

42
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:22,038
have an older version
on your account.

43
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:24,650
So what I'm going to need you
to do is uninstall that

44
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,434
<i>and install
the latest version.</i>

45
00:06:26,434 --> 00:06:28,349
Well, I have no idea
how to do that.

46
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:29,916
My daughter set up
everything for me.

47
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,526
<i>Well, I would recommend</i>

48
00:06:31,526 --> 00:06:32,875
<i>you take your computer
to an IT specialist.</i>

49
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,442
However, keep in mind

50
00:06:34,442 --> 00:06:36,444
that you will lose
all your data,

51
00:06:36,444 --> 00:06:38,707
since they'll have to replace
the hard drive.

52
00:06:40,143 --> 00:06:41,493
I'm pretty remote out here.

53
00:06:43,756 --> 00:06:45,497
Everything I have
is on the computer.

54
00:06:45,497 --> 00:06:47,107
<i>Okay. There is actually</i>

55
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:48,848
<i>a software package
that you can download</i>

56
00:06:48,848 --> 00:06:51,154
that would allow me
to reinstall remotely.

57
00:06:51,154 --> 00:06:54,157
All right.
Tell me what to do.

58
00:06:54,636 --> 00:06:57,030
It's okay. Can you, uh,
can you type this,

59
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:00,076
Friendly friend dot net?

60
00:07:00,076 --> 00:07:02,165
<i>Spelled just how it sounds.</i>

61
00:07:03,776 --> 00:07:05,038
Okay. I'm there.

62
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:06,474
And there should be a button

63
00:07:06,474 --> 00:07:07,562
on your screen
that says "install."

64
00:07:07,562 --> 00:07:08,911
<i>Can you click on that button?</i>

65
00:07:08,911 --> 00:07:10,783
- I clicked the button.

66
00:07:10,783 --> 00:07:12,045
So you're about
to see some windows

67
00:07:12,045 --> 00:07:13,525
open, close on your desktop,

68
00:07:13,525 --> 00:07:15,614
<i>as I reinstall
the virus shield for you.</i>

69
00:07:17,485 --> 00:07:18,660
Okay.

70
00:07:19,008 --> 00:07:20,749
I hope you fucking clowns
are paying attention.

71
00:07:20,749 --> 00:07:21,968
You stick to the script,

72
00:07:22,447 --> 00:07:26,625
but not so much that you sound
like a goddamn robot.

73
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:27,843
- All right?

74
00:07:27,843 --> 00:07:30,542
She has got
10K checking,

75
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:33,458
life insurance annuity,
Roth IRA,

76
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,720
teacher's pension and...

77
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,331
Holy fucking shit!

78
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,159
-  All right.

79
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,291
She is a signatory

80
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:44,338
on a $2 million dollar
account.

81
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:47,472
Some, uh...
It's some fucking charity.

82
00:07:47,472 --> 00:07:50,866
All right, kids,
let the strip mining begin.

83
00:07:53,086 --> 00:07:54,653
Ooh.
My computer's going crazy.

84
00:07:54,653 --> 00:07:56,524
<i>Totally normal.</i>

85
00:07:56,524 --> 00:07:57,786
<i>Just do not touch
your keyboard.</i>

86
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:06,534
Because of this inconvenience,

87
00:08:06,534 --> 00:08:08,014
I'm going to credit back
your subscription fees.

88
00:08:08,014 --> 00:08:09,189
How about that?

89
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,365
I've gone ahead
and deposited $500

90
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,280
into the account ending 020.

91
00:08:13,802 --> 00:08:15,543
Oh, that's not my account.

92
00:08:15,543 --> 00:08:17,284
That's an account
that I manage.

93
00:08:17,284 --> 00:08:18,764
Can you log into that account

94
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,548
and verify the transfer,
please, Miss Parker?

95
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:24,465
Just hold on.

96
00:08:24,465 --> 00:08:26,293
Yes, there's...

97
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,558
There's a transfer
for $50,000?

98
00:08:32,168 --> 00:08:35,563
- Set the hook with sympathy.

99
00:08:35,563 --> 00:08:37,173
- Miss Parker, I...

100
00:08:38,131 --> 00:08:39,567
I made a terrible mistake.

101
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:41,090
<i>I was supposed
to credit you 500,</i>

102
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,918
<i>but I don't know,
I got a stuck key here.</i>

103
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:45,268
<i>I'm gonna lose my job here.</i>

104
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:48,097
- I got kids.

105
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:49,446
I ain't got fucking kids.

106
00:08:50,883 --> 00:08:53,538
Oh, I don't want you
to get in trouble, but...

107
00:08:53,538 --> 00:08:57,629
I could wire the amount back.

108
00:08:57,629 --> 00:09:01,502
I will need
a different password though.

109
00:09:01,502 --> 00:09:02,938
One second.

110
00:09:02,938 --> 00:09:06,159
This is the master password
for all her accounts.

111
00:09:06,638 --> 00:09:11,164
Okay, so the second we get it,
we zero out everything.

112
00:09:11,164 --> 00:09:13,166
Um...

113
00:09:15,734 --> 00:09:17,605
You know, I, um...

114
00:09:18,388 --> 00:09:21,653
I think
I should call the bank. Hm?

115
00:09:22,088 --> 00:09:23,393
<i>You know what?
You're probably right.</i>

116
00:09:23,393 --> 00:09:26,005
But there goes my job,

117
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,312
and there goes all your data.

118
00:09:34,927 --> 00:09:39,975
All my kids' pictures
are on this computer.

119
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,589
- Okay.

120
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:51,291
Boom! Fucking yes!

121
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,946
That is what
I am talking about! Come on!

122
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,080
Let me fucking hear it!
I fucking love you people!

123
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,429
I fucking love you!

124
00:10:03,651 --> 00:10:04,739
Hello?

125
00:10:05,131 --> 00:10:06,698
Hello? You still there?

126
00:10:15,228 --> 00:10:16,577
Uh-oh.

127
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:21,930
- Oh.

128
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,285
Oh.

129
00:10:47,695 --> 00:10:49,001
What did I do?

130
00:10:49,871 --> 00:10:51,873
Stupid...

131
00:11:33,523 --> 00:11:34,742
Mrs. Parker?

132
00:11:59,724 --> 00:12:00,986
Don't move.

133
00:12:01,726 --> 00:12:03,728
Don't you fucking move.

134
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,642
Drop the knife.

135
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,778
Hands behind your back.

136
00:12:14,477 --> 00:12:17,654
Slowly get on your knees
one knee at a time.

137
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,794
- Now, who the fuck are you...

138
00:12:26,794 --> 00:12:28,927
...and what are you doing
in my mother's house?

139
00:12:32,191 --> 00:12:33,235
Verona...

140
00:12:34,976 --> 00:12:36,064
I'm so sorry.

141
00:12:36,891 --> 00:12:38,066
How do you know my...

142
00:12:42,288 --> 00:12:43,724
Mom.

143
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:51,688
<i>Until we can clear him,
he's our best and only perp.</i>

144
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,125
Clear him?

145
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,517
Agent Parker,
I know that's your mother.

146
00:12:54,517 --> 00:12:55,562
I understand.

147
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,000
But there's a world where
she committed suicide.

148
00:13:02,787 --> 00:13:06,094
Suicide? You can't be serious.

149
00:13:06,094 --> 00:13:09,750
That woman loved life
more than anybody I know.

150
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,970
But by all means,
let's just completely ignore

151
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,015
the big white dude
in her house with a knife.

152
00:13:14,015 --> 00:13:15,190
Get him up.

153
00:13:15,843 --> 00:13:16,801
Come on.

154
00:13:21,153 --> 00:13:22,415
It's Clay, right?

155
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:24,069
Adam Clay?

156
00:13:24,852 --> 00:13:26,767
I don't have much to say.

157
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:28,290
Mr. Clay, we just got
a couple of questions.

158
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,596
Like, what the fuck
were you doing

159
00:13:29,596 --> 00:13:30,858
in my mother's house?

160
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,469
I was bringing her
a jar of honey.

161
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,255
A jar of honey.

162
00:13:37,386 --> 00:13:38,518
Who the fuck are you?
Winnie-the-Pooh?

163
00:13:39,345 --> 00:13:40,476
I keep bees.

164
00:13:42,261 --> 00:13:43,697
How do you know my mother?

165
00:13:44,611 --> 00:13:46,482
I rent some space
in the barn from her.

166
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,658
I have a signed lease.

167
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:52,749
But what the fuck
were you doing in her house?

168
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,710
She didn't answer
when I knocked.

169
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,016
I noted her car
in the driveway.

170
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,366
I heard the smoke alarm
and I entered.

171
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,237
You "noted"?

172
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,283
You got a law enforcement
background?

173
00:14:04,979 --> 00:14:06,894
I told you,
I take care of bees.

174
00:14:52,287 --> 00:14:53,549
Oh, my God.

175
00:15:16,964 --> 00:15:19,227
His hands tested
negative for gunshot residue.

176
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,708
But the prints on the gun
were your mother's.

177
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,929
It seems, sadly,
it was suicide.

178
00:15:35,548 --> 00:15:38,725
Mr. Clay, I need to apologize
for last night.

179
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,294
I realize I may have been
a little aggressive.

180
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,386
That's understandable.

181
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,261
Could I interest you
in something a bit stronger?

182
00:15:55,785 --> 00:15:56,830
No.

183
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,833
But I'll sit with you
if you like.

184
00:16:07,014 --> 00:16:07,972
No, thank you.

185
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:13,542
I wanted to thank you

186
00:16:15,022 --> 00:16:16,371
for taking care of my mom.

187
00:16:18,547 --> 00:16:21,072
I tried to stay in her life
as much as I could.

188
00:16:21,072 --> 00:16:22,595
Obviously, I could have
done a better job.

189
00:16:25,815 --> 00:16:27,382
Being old
can be a lonely thing.

190
00:16:29,341 --> 00:16:32,997
Turn a certain age, you cease
to exist. Cease to matter.

191
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:36,435
Used to be a part of life,
of the family.

192
00:16:37,392 --> 00:16:39,220
Part of the hive,
I guess you could say.

193
00:16:41,614 --> 00:16:43,920
There's some British Isles
hiding in your accent.

194
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:47,881
I was born there.

195
00:16:50,797 --> 00:16:52,755
I hated that she was
out here alone.

196
00:16:54,627 --> 00:16:55,802
She wouldn't leave.

197
00:16:59,023 --> 00:17:00,241
There's too many memories.

198
00:17:03,853 --> 00:17:05,768
You know, I think I know
why she liked you.

199
00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:07,944
You're just like my brother.

200
00:17:09,598 --> 00:17:11,470
He was in MARSOC,
a Marine Raider.

201
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,951
He was killed
a few years ago kicking doors.

202
00:17:16,257 --> 00:17:18,868
She loved him.

203
00:17:20,087 --> 00:17:21,610
He'd mow the lawn

204
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,570
and you'd think
he invented fire.

205
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:26,572
You know, while I graduated
the FBI Academy

206
00:17:26,572 --> 00:17:28,748
and she said,
"Oh, that's nice."

207
00:17:31,881 --> 00:17:33,013
She got scammed.

208
00:17:34,884 --> 00:17:36,973
Somebody emptied out
all her accounts,

209
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,759
her savings, her retirement.

210
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,762
Got every penny.
Maxed out all her cards.

211
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,677
She was an educator,

212
00:17:44,677 --> 00:17:46,679
director of a charity
for kids.

213
00:17:47,636 --> 00:17:49,377
They got two million
out of that account.

214
00:17:51,858 --> 00:17:53,642
- You know who did it?

215
00:17:53,642 --> 00:17:55,427
I talked to an agent
in our cyber-crimes office.

216
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:57,690
This crew's been operating
for two years

217
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,995
and we don't even have names.

218
00:17:59,692 --> 00:18:01,433
And even if we did, good luck
building an indictment

219
00:18:01,433 --> 00:18:02,651
that would stand up in court.

220
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,089
Some defense attorney
would just argue that

221
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:07,352
the elderly victim agreed

222
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,658
to wire a complete stranger
his entire life savings.

223
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,226
Taking from an elderly person

224
00:18:12,226 --> 00:18:13,793
is as bad as stealing
from a child.

225
00:18:15,664 --> 00:18:16,970
Maybe worse.

226
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,798
Someone hurts a child,

227
00:18:20,147 --> 00:18:21,322
there are parents.

228
00:18:22,149 --> 00:18:24,064
People who care,
ready to step in.

229
00:18:25,631 --> 00:18:27,328
Someone hurts
an older person...

230
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:32,028
sometimes they're left to face
the hornets alone.

231
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:36,120
Because either
it goes unnoticed...

232
00:18:38,774 --> 00:18:39,993
or no one cares.

233
00:18:41,516 --> 00:18:42,735
I care.

234
00:18:44,476 --> 00:18:45,738
And I'm stubborn.

235
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,262
And so help me God,

236
00:18:48,654 --> 00:18:50,699
I'm going to get these
motherfuckers who did this.

237
00:18:56,662 --> 00:18:58,446
I need to take care
of the hive.

238
00:19:01,449 --> 00:19:02,798
You've been up all night.

239
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,366
The hive
is more important.

240
00:19:21,948 --> 00:19:23,558
What are you doing?

241
00:19:23,558 --> 00:19:25,517
- I thought you retired.
<i><i>I did.</i>

242
00:19:26,735 --> 00:19:27,910
I need a favor.

243
00:19:28,389 --> 00:19:29,608
<i>What kind of favor?</i>

244
00:19:30,304 --> 00:19:32,263
A name and address.

245
00:19:32,915 --> 00:19:35,091
<i>- Easy.</i>
- Not easy.

246
00:19:36,397 --> 00:19:38,747
Even the FBI can't
find these people.

247
00:19:39,531 --> 00:19:40,967
Well, we're not the FBI,
are we?

248
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:42,708
<i>Shoot me the deets
and stand by.</i>

249
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,716
Yeah.

250
00:19:50,716 --> 00:19:52,196
You weren't kidding.
This one kicked my butt.

251
00:19:52,674 --> 00:19:54,067
They're routing
all over the world.

252
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,416
But you found them?

253
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,375
Sure.
But who are these people?

254
00:19:58,419 --> 00:19:59,899
I'm gonna find out.

255
00:20:05,209 --> 00:20:06,688
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

256
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:08,342
The hell you think
you're going, pal?

257
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:10,344
This United Data Group?

258
00:20:10,344 --> 00:20:11,737
Don't know nothing about that.

259
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:14,870
This is private property,
and you're trespassing.

260
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,132
I'm going inside.

261
00:20:17,308 --> 00:20:18,657
I'm going to burn it down.

262
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:20,920
Yeah, that's not happening, buddy.

263
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,443
You're not going
any-fucking-where

264
00:20:22,443 --> 00:20:24,402
except right the fuck back
the way you came.

265
00:20:24,402 --> 00:20:26,230
Do you know what they do here?

266
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:29,233
Buddy, I'm counting to three.

267
00:20:29,842 --> 00:20:31,583
One, two, three.

268
00:20:32,061 --> 00:20:33,933
There. I did it for you.

269
00:20:36,675 --> 00:20:38,242
You aware
this is a criminal outfit?

270
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:40,635
Scamming the weakest
in our society.

271
00:20:40,635 --> 00:20:42,768
Stealing everything they have.

272
00:20:43,464 --> 00:20:44,857
Do you know
that's who you work for?

273
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,524
<i>I'm looking
for the call center.</i>

274
00:21:00,046 --> 00:21:01,221
Yeah,
you're in the right place.

275
00:21:01,221 --> 00:21:02,962
You just have to sign in here.

276
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,316
Tell any other companies
in the building

277
00:21:09,316 --> 00:21:10,274
to evacuate now.

278
00:21:11,405 --> 00:21:13,929
- There's going to be a fire.
- Okay. Th...

279
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:14,843
Thanks.

280
00:21:19,805 --> 00:21:21,285
Hang up the phone.

281
00:21:21,285 --> 00:21:23,243
Nah, I'm good, buddy.
I'm just doing my thing here.

282
00:21:25,332 --> 00:21:26,377
Hang up the phone.

283
00:21:26,855 --> 00:21:30,381
Uh, Miss Perkins, so sorry,
I'll have to

284
00:21:30,381 --> 00:21:32,252
- call you right back.
- Everyone...

285
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,603
I need your attention, please.

286
00:21:36,343 --> 00:21:37,301
Repeat after me.

287
00:21:38,606 --> 00:21:41,087
I will never steal
from the weak

288
00:21:41,087 --> 00:21:42,175
and the vulnerable again.

289
00:21:44,308 --> 00:21:46,222
I sent you
a department download,

290
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:47,833
and we'll find out
what's going on...

291
00:22:01,673 --> 00:22:02,761
Repeat after me.

292
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:05,764
I will never steal
from the weak

293
00:22:05,764 --> 00:22:07,156
and the vulnerable again.

294
00:22:07,156 --> 00:22:08,941
I will never steal
from the weak

295
00:22:08,941 --> 00:22:10,551
and the vulnerable again.

296
00:22:13,641 --> 00:22:15,034
To help you keep that promise,

297
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:17,906
I'm gonna burn this place
to the ground.

298
00:22:20,866 --> 00:22:22,650
Might be a good time
to go home.

299
00:22:23,782 --> 00:22:25,044
Oh, my God!

300
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:26,785
It's gas!
Fucking psycho.

301
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,875
It's gas!

302
00:22:31,006 --> 00:22:32,530
It's gas! It's gas!

303
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,970
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

304
00:22:38,579 --> 00:22:40,276
What the fuck, bro?

305
00:22:41,452 --> 00:22:43,062
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

306
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:44,063
I'm a beekeeper.

307
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:46,500
I protect the hive.

308
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:50,025
Sometimes I use fire
to smoke out hornets.

309
00:22:50,591 --> 00:22:53,594
This a multi-million dollar
operation, asshole.

310
00:22:53,594 --> 00:22:55,291
Okay, so you can't
come up here,

311
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,728
white-knighting shit.

312
00:23:00,732 --> 00:23:02,734
Will you stomp
his ass out, please?

313
00:23:18,837 --> 00:23:20,882
I got it. You fucking get him.

314
00:23:20,882 --> 00:23:22,797
- You fucking get him!

315
00:23:32,459 --> 00:23:34,418
Bet you feel
really proud of yourself.

316
00:23:56,265 --> 00:23:57,571
Mister...?

317
00:23:58,006 --> 00:23:59,486
Uh...

318
00:23:59,486 --> 00:24:01,532
- Uh, uh,  Garnett.
- Mr. Garnett.

319
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:05,971
I don't care if your friends
here live or die.

320
00:24:05,971 --> 00:24:09,017
The next call
from your little phishing scam

321
00:24:09,017 --> 00:24:10,497
to this call center

322
00:24:10,497 --> 00:24:12,760
will make a spark
across these wires.

323
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,154
Given all of
the gasoline fumes in here,

324
00:24:16,895 --> 00:24:17,983
I promise you...

325
00:24:20,115 --> 00:24:22,030
anything alive in here
won't be.

326
00:24:27,514 --> 00:24:29,603
Uh, guys,
we might want to dip out.

327
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:57,413
Hey. What's going on?

328
00:24:57,413 --> 00:25:02,070
Uh, let me get flat white,
oat milk, of course,

329
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,029
and, uh,
extra shot of espresso.

330
00:25:04,029 --> 00:25:05,596
- Of course, sir.
- Thank you.

331
00:25:05,596 --> 00:25:09,469
Good morning. Did we get
the otoro and the uni in?

332
00:25:09,991 --> 00:25:11,340
- Yes, sure.
- We did?

333
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,081
- Yes.
- Fucking finally. Great.

334
00:25:15,997 --> 00:25:17,956
-  Hey, Michaela.
- Yes.

335
00:25:17,956 --> 00:25:20,480
It... it came back.
The whole thing. Yeah.

336
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,874
And it's like I can barely
fucking move.

337
00:25:22,874 --> 00:25:24,397
- It's all tweaked.

338
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:27,748
- Oh, those are nice.
Mmm-hmm.

339
00:25:27,748 --> 00:25:29,576
- Those the new bowls?
- Yeah.

340
00:25:31,186 --> 00:25:33,232
- That's perfect. Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.

341
00:25:38,716 --> 00:25:40,239
What? I'm in a meeting.

342
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,457
<i>You said
hit me on voice</i>

343
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:42,589
<i>if there's an emergency.</i>

344
00:25:42,589 --> 00:25:45,026
Okay. Right. Well, uh...

345
00:25:46,027 --> 00:25:49,030
It seems we had
a disgruntled customer.

346
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:53,165
Uh, I just can't comprehend
why you're bothering me.

347
00:25:53,165 --> 00:25:54,819
Just get in touch
with the attorney

348
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:55,689
and start shoving back.

349
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:59,780
Well, yeah, I don't think
that legal's gonna help much.

350
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,261
Okay, tell me what the fuck
is going on right now.

351
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:04,916
This dude just strolls in

352
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:07,005
saying we're stealing
from people,

353
00:26:07,005 --> 00:26:09,834
<i>and he just tears through
all my security guys,</i>

354
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:13,315
<i>like, fucking tissue paper
and, um...</i>

355
00:26:13,315 --> 00:26:14,229
And what?

356
00:26:15,317 --> 00:26:16,797
And he burns the place
to the ground.

357
00:26:18,146 --> 00:26:19,495
<i>Yeah. The call center is gone.</i>

358
00:26:20,366 --> 00:26:23,021
<i>I'm standing here staring
at a $30 million building,</i>

359
00:26:23,021 --> 00:26:26,067
it's now
a giant fucking ashtray.

360
00:26:27,242 --> 00:26:28,548
Four people didn't get out.

361
00:26:28,548 --> 00:26:30,071
You're telling me
that this asshole

362
00:26:30,071 --> 00:26:31,333
burnt the entire building down

363
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:32,683
and dropped
four fucking bodies?

364
00:26:33,161 --> 00:26:35,207
Yeah, that's not exactly
a disgruntled customer, is it?

365
00:26:35,207 --> 00:26:36,861
<i>Who did this?
Give me a name right now.</i>

366
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:38,602
Sir, I don't have it.

367
00:26:38,602 --> 00:26:41,822
<i>All the cameras and the drives
burned up in the fire.</i>

368
00:26:41,822 --> 00:26:43,650
He had a hat.

369
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,739
Oh, he had a hat. Okay.

370
00:26:45,739 --> 00:26:47,436
I'm gonna hit you back.
All right?

371
00:26:47,436 --> 00:26:49,134
I got to go big-dog this shit
for a minute.

372
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:57,098
- Hey, I need to talk to you.
- About what?

373
00:26:57,751 --> 00:26:58,883
What? What? No, nothing.

374
00:26:59,361 --> 00:27:01,842
I mean, if I had a friend
who, like, had a call center

375
00:27:01,842 --> 00:27:04,192
and someone burned it down,
maybe killed some people,

376
00:27:04,192 --> 00:27:05,890
you could get him, right?

377
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:07,805
Get him?

378
00:27:07,805 --> 00:27:09,023
Yeah,
like disappear the problem.

379
00:27:09,023 --> 00:27:11,547
- Come on.

380
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,158
I'll be an hour.

381
00:27:13,158 --> 00:27:15,334
That's way above my pay grade.

382
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:16,988
You literally ran the CIA,

383
00:27:16,988 --> 00:27:18,598
and you're telling me
you can't just find

384
00:27:18,598 --> 00:27:20,078
some guy in Massachusetts?

385
00:27:20,078 --> 00:27:21,601
Listen, this sounds
like a job for the police.

386
00:27:22,297 --> 00:27:23,342
I just need a name.

387
00:27:23,777 --> 00:27:25,170
Well, you won't get it
from me.

388
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,173
And you keep me
a million miles away

389
00:27:28,173 --> 00:27:29,653
from your metaverse meth lab

390
00:27:29,653 --> 00:27:30,566
or whatever it is.

391
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,352
- Yup.

392
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:34,875
So check it out.

393
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:36,529
Daddy can't hold your hand
on this one.

394
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:39,314
Uh, this is clearly some kind
of crime of passion,

395
00:27:39,314 --> 00:27:40,489
spur of the moment,

396
00:27:40,489 --> 00:27:42,274
someone snapped,
like, whatever.

397
00:27:42,274 --> 00:27:43,623
But, uh,
what we're going to do is

398
00:27:43,623 --> 00:27:44,885
I'm going to send you
some credentials,

399
00:27:44,885 --> 00:27:46,365
you're going
to log into our cloud

400
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:47,845
and you're going
to look at anyone connected

401
00:27:47,845 --> 00:27:49,368
to the last few deals
you closed. All right?

402
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:50,891
<i>Just, I don't know,
start there.</i>

403
00:27:50,891 --> 00:27:53,111
And, like,
what if I find this guy?

404
00:27:53,111 --> 00:27:54,329
Then what?

405
00:27:54,329 --> 00:27:56,592
You get a wrecking crew
together

406
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:57,855
and you go <i>Goodfellas</i>
on him.

407
00:27:57,855 --> 00:27:59,378
I mean, come on,
you're a connected guy, right?

408
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:00,466
Do you understand?

409
00:28:02,424 --> 00:28:04,644
Yeah. No, I understand.
I, uh...

410
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:06,211
I'll get it done.

411
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,794
It's called a day off.

412
00:28:24,882 --> 00:28:25,883
<i>V, you good?</i>

413
00:28:26,361 --> 00:28:27,711
Yeah, I'm great. Why?

414
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:30,322
I mean, you did
lose your mother yesterday.

415
00:28:33,717 --> 00:28:34,718
Yeah.

416
00:28:37,459 --> 00:28:39,157
<i>What do you want, Wiley?</i>

417
00:28:39,157 --> 00:28:40,811
Are you leaving?
Please don't go.

418
00:28:40,811 --> 00:28:42,813
I'm going to yoga.

419
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,424
- Remember United Data Group?

420
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:49,994
<i>Go on.</i>

421
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,213
You sober enough to drive?

422
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,044
Yeah.

423
00:29:00,874 --> 00:29:02,441
Give us a few seconds,
thank you.

424
00:29:04,965 --> 00:29:06,140
Where's mine?

425
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,751
It's an old cup from my car

426
00:29:07,751 --> 00:29:09,230
with instant
and gas station hot water.

427
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,579
Ew.

428
00:29:10,579 --> 00:29:11,667
- You want a sip?
- No.

429
00:29:12,581 --> 00:29:16,150
So the fire fried
all the CCTV footage.

430
00:29:17,325 --> 00:29:19,327
Receptionist said she saw
some jacked dude in his 40s,

431
00:29:19,327 --> 00:29:21,155
manhandled security
and walked in

432
00:29:21,155 --> 00:29:22,156
with a couple gas cans.

433
00:29:22,896 --> 00:29:25,464
This clown car saw everything,
but no one's talking.

434
00:29:25,856 --> 00:29:28,554
They're all frequent fliers
with perjury,

435
00:29:28,554 --> 00:29:30,730
fraud and cyber BeEFs.

436
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:33,864
Fucking scumbags.
I want IDs on all of them.

437
00:29:37,215 --> 00:29:39,391
You know, this is just the tip
of, like, 20 spears, right?

438
00:29:40,522 --> 00:29:41,785
Can I just have this moment?

439
00:29:57,452 --> 00:29:58,845
Eloise Parker.

440
00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:01,500
Yeah, I took her for over
two million yesterday.

441
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,894
She's, uh... she's Black,

442
00:30:03,894 --> 00:30:05,939
widow, just has a daughter
in Boston.

443
00:30:05,939 --> 00:30:08,159
I don't think this is it,
but, you know.

444
00:30:10,378 --> 00:30:13,338
You said your boy
has an old-ass pickup truck.

445
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:15,862
That's him.

446
00:30:26,655 --> 00:30:28,483
What the hell are those?

447
00:30:29,876 --> 00:30:31,312
Fucking beehives.

448
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,532
Yeah, dickhead was talking
about them.

449
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:36,143
I guess he's a, like,
bee lover.

450
00:30:37,492 --> 00:30:38,885
You know what?

451
00:30:38,885 --> 00:30:41,888
He breaks my shit,
you break his shit.

452
00:31:29,718 --> 00:31:31,416
Where you at, bee boy?

453
00:31:33,331 --> 00:31:35,420
You fucking hiding, bitch?

454
00:31:36,203 --> 00:31:38,336
Come out and fucking face us!

455
00:31:47,127 --> 00:31:48,520
Bye, bitch, now!

456
00:31:49,303 --> 00:31:50,565
Let's go!

457
00:32:58,285 --> 00:33:00,113
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

458
00:33:00,766 --> 00:33:02,811
Can someone,
like, fucking help me?

459
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,251
Fuck.

460
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:09,122
No! I'm okay.

461
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:14,214
We can talk about this.

462
00:33:14,214 --> 00:33:15,694
We can talk about this.

463
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:17,652
Let's just work this out,
me and you. We can fix...

464
00:33:17,652 --> 00:33:19,915
No, no!

465
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:24,050
Oh, fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

466
00:33:35,801 --> 00:33:39,196
So, help me understand
because I'm a little confused.

467
00:33:39,196 --> 00:33:40,762
What's the nature
of your business?

468
00:33:40,762 --> 00:33:42,895
Don't know nothing
about no business.

469
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,462
So then why are people
just wiring you

470
00:33:44,462 --> 00:33:45,941
their entire life savings?

471
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:48,901
Must be
your winning personality.

472
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,033
They got us lawyers,

473
00:33:50,033 --> 00:33:51,686
so maybe
you want to talk to them.

474
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:55,168
You know, this is a really
nice shirt, by the way.

475
00:33:55,168 --> 00:33:57,344
Did you steal it out
of a casket, you dog fucker?

476
00:33:57,344 --> 00:33:59,085
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa. Uh...

477
00:33:59,085 --> 00:34:00,565
Verona, if you're done
shitting all over

478
00:34:00,565 --> 00:34:02,132
this gentleman's civil rights,

479
00:34:02,132 --> 00:34:03,742
can I speak to you
for a moment?

480
00:34:05,091 --> 00:34:06,310
That's a nice shirt.

481
00:34:08,225 --> 00:34:10,749
- V.
- Yeah, I know. I know.

482
00:34:12,142 --> 00:34:13,273
I'm an asshole.

483
00:34:14,361 --> 00:34:16,102
Oh, so you like fires?

484
00:34:16,842 --> 00:34:17,843
Yeah, today I do.

485
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:20,541
Good, 'cause, uh,
today's your lucky day.

486
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:23,327
'Cause apparently,
your mother's house

487
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:25,155
is on fire, too,
and some other shit.

488
00:34:25,155 --> 00:34:26,721
- Let's go.
- Wait. What?

489
00:34:26,721 --> 00:34:29,289
Yeah. Shit's on fire.
Let's go.

490
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:47,220
You good?

491
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:48,961
V, you okay?

492
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:51,790
Yeah.

493
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,881
- That's a new one.
- Jesus Christ.

494
00:34:55,881 --> 00:34:58,057
Where's Maggie?
Hey, Maggie, ID?

495
00:35:02,235 --> 00:35:04,629
- United Data Group.
Well, he's handsome.

496
00:35:05,673 --> 00:35:06,805
Thank you.

497
00:35:09,112 --> 00:35:10,200
Are you okay?

498
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,202
Yeah, Wiley, I'm good.
I'm good.

499
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:15,205
You think there's
even the remotest chance

500
00:35:15,205 --> 00:35:18,121
that the dude who burned down
United Data Group

501
00:35:18,121 --> 00:35:19,339
is the same guy
renting this spot

502
00:35:19,339 --> 00:35:20,340
from your mother?

503
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,128
The beekeeper.

504
00:35:28,957 --> 00:35:30,872
I lost my virginity
in that barn.

505
00:35:40,926 --> 00:35:42,623
Fucking shit.

506
00:35:55,288 --> 00:35:58,030
The universe is going
to have to wait.

507
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,249
I gotta take this.

508
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:04,558
Yo, what's up, playa?

509
00:36:04,558 --> 00:36:05,907
This is the part
where you tell me

510
00:36:05,907 --> 00:36:07,344
what a good job you did,

511
00:36:07,344 --> 00:36:09,955
and I put you on a G6
to Hawaii to chill for a week.

512
00:36:09,955 --> 00:36:11,435
I'm so sorry, Mr. Danforth.

513
00:36:12,784 --> 00:36:14,046
Did you fuck this up?

514
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,526
Are you fucking crying
right now?

515
00:36:15,526 --> 00:36:19,051
I'm not crying.
I'm bleeding.

516
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,009
Bleeding?
Why are you bleeding?

517
00:36:21,009 --> 00:36:22,359
What do you mean, bleeding?

518
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:26,014
My fingers on my right hand.

519
00:36:26,537 --> 00:36:27,668
He cut them off.

520
00:36:27,668 --> 00:36:30,715
Okay. Fuck off. Go. Go.

521
00:36:32,934 --> 00:36:36,024
He? Who the fuck is he?
Tell me who he is right now.

522
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:40,246
I don't know.
A fucking beekeeper.

523
00:36:40,246 --> 00:36:43,336
<i>Makes honey and
fucks with beehives.</i>

524
00:36:43,336 --> 00:36:46,034
He fucks with beehives?
What's he saying about bees?

525
00:36:46,687 --> 00:36:48,123
I don't know.
He said he was, like,

526
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:50,082
protecting the hive
or something.

527
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:51,953
- Oh, fuck, man. What the...

528
00:36:51,953 --> 00:36:53,912
Oh, Jesus Christ!

529
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:55,261
No, no, no! Bro, bro, bro!

530
00:36:55,261 --> 00:36:56,784
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

531
00:36:56,784 --> 00:36:58,960
You want money?
You want crypto? NFTs?

532
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,484
I got fucking NFTs.

533
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:02,268
What are you fucking... What?

534
00:37:02,268 --> 00:37:04,444
No! Dude,
what the fuck is this, man?

535
00:37:07,665 --> 00:37:08,840
Don't move.

536
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:12,060
I fucking can't move!

537
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:15,194
<i>You're fucking crazy, man.</i>

538
00:37:15,194 --> 00:37:17,022
What the fuck, bro?

539
00:37:31,732 --> 00:37:33,995
What the fuck!
No, no, no, no! No, no, no!

540
00:37:33,995 --> 00:37:37,303
Fucking stop the fucking car!
No! No!

541
00:37:53,667 --> 00:37:55,887
Who do I have the pleasure
of speaking with?

542
00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:00,674
Fuck you. That's who.

543
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:02,372
You burned down
my million-dollar

544
00:38:02,372 --> 00:38:03,286
fucking call center.

545
00:38:04,374 --> 00:38:05,984
Now I'm going
to burn you down.

546
00:38:07,377 --> 00:38:08,769
You haven't told me your name.

547
00:38:08,769 --> 00:38:10,423
I told you my name.

548
00:38:10,423 --> 00:38:11,642
It's fuck you. Mr. Fuck You.

549
00:38:11,642 --> 00:38:12,904
You better fucking
remember it.

550
00:38:12,904 --> 00:38:14,340
<i>Because you don't
burn me down.</i>

551
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,994
<i>I burn you down.
You understand me?</i>

552
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:18,431
You are fucking with forces
that you cannot comprehend.

553
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,520
You sound young.

554
00:38:21,652 --> 00:38:22,914
I bet you don't
have estate planning.

555
00:38:23,654 --> 00:38:26,047
I'm fucking 28 years old.
Why would I need that?

556
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,398
I'm about to show you.

557
00:38:46,894 --> 00:38:48,374
<i>Breaking news in Springfield,</i>

558
00:38:48,374 --> 00:38:50,028
<i>where three bodies
have been discovered</i>

559
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:52,378
<i>following an arson fire
at a small farm.</i>

560
00:38:52,378 --> 00:38:54,249
<i>There was an office building
explosion...</i>

561
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:57,340
- And you say one guy did this?
Yup.

562
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:01,866
Killed seven armed men
without firing a shot.

563
00:39:02,693 --> 00:39:05,130
Yup. And he said
he was going to kill me.

564
00:39:05,739 --> 00:39:07,306
And this is your

565
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:12,093
data mining consumer service
business, right?

566
00:39:13,094 --> 00:39:14,661
Yes, something like that.

567
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:17,098
Pulling in 9 million a month
in one office.

568
00:39:17,098 --> 00:39:18,273
I've got, like, 20.

569
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,754
Yeah.

570
00:39:22,887 --> 00:39:24,889
And the only thing
you know about him

571
00:39:25,716 --> 00:39:27,282
is he says he's a beekeeper.

572
00:39:28,196 --> 00:39:30,285
Yeah, it's like
his whole brand or whatever.

573
00:39:32,897 --> 00:39:35,595
Jesus.

574
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,597
What?

575
00:39:40,034 --> 00:39:46,345
For someone who has elevated
fucking up into an art form,

576
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:49,783
this might well
be your <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

577
00:39:50,871 --> 00:39:52,525
How did I fuck up?

578
00:39:53,134 --> 00:39:56,007
I don't know.
You've done something.

579
00:39:57,095 --> 00:39:58,705
You've disturbed a Beekeeper.

580
00:39:58,705 --> 00:40:00,228
Oh.

581
00:40:00,228 --> 00:40:02,187
Oh, okay.
So fucking what?

582
00:40:02,187 --> 00:40:04,058
Why'd I care if the guy
keeps bees?

583
00:40:04,058 --> 00:40:06,321
If a Beekeeper
says you're gonna die,

584
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:07,497
you're gonna die.

585
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:11,065
There's nothing I can do
or anybody else to stop it.

586
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:16,244
So, like, what do you
even do here, then?

587
00:40:16,244 --> 00:40:17,855
What good are you?

588
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,596
Yeah.

589
00:40:21,206 --> 00:40:26,298
I did 35 years of loyal
government service,

590
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:29,867
culminating as director
of the world's

591
00:40:29,867 --> 00:40:31,738
premier intelligence agency.

592
00:40:31,738 --> 00:40:33,305
I could have done anything,

593
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:35,699
but I chose this job
as a favor to your mother.

594
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,877
I keep
Danforth Enterprises safe.

595
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:44,534
Keep her reputation safe,
her name safe.

596
00:40:44,534 --> 00:40:46,623
It's my fucking name too,
all right?

597
00:40:46,623 --> 00:40:48,451
Oh, sit down.

598
00:40:48,451 --> 00:40:50,191
I put up with you.

599
00:40:50,191 --> 00:40:51,976
I've put up
with your tantrums,

600
00:40:51,976 --> 00:40:55,066
kept you out of the tabloids,
kept you out of jail.

601
00:40:55,545 --> 00:40:59,505
The endless stream
of sex workers.

602
00:41:02,247 --> 00:41:04,945
You're a drowning man.
Do you know that?

603
00:41:05,946 --> 00:41:07,078
Mm.

604
00:41:07,078 --> 00:41:08,035
You're scared.

605
00:41:08,035 --> 00:41:09,559
Dead right I'm scared.

606
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:13,563
Terrified. So should you be.

607
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:17,480
Wallace, just tell me
what the fuck this guy is.

608
00:41:21,788 --> 00:41:24,878
He's probably
the last pair of eyes

609
00:41:24,878 --> 00:41:26,314
that you're going to sneer at.

610
00:41:32,538 --> 00:41:33,931
Okay, listen.

611
00:41:33,931 --> 00:41:35,454
Remember our favorite
burning building?

612
00:41:35,454 --> 00:41:37,195
United Data Group.

613
00:41:37,195 --> 00:41:38,544
The guys who work there
are hackers,

614
00:41:38,544 --> 00:41:40,807
con men, fraudsters,
et cetera, et cetera.

615
00:41:40,807 --> 00:41:42,896
Guy who ran it. Garnett.

616
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,073
He's in the book.
He's a known mob associate.

617
00:41:46,073 --> 00:41:48,162
He's missing, but I've got
PD chasing him down.

618
00:41:48,162 --> 00:41:50,774
Okay, so I had some analysts
run some shit,

619
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:53,341
and I think I'm starting to
get the shape of the animal.

620
00:41:53,341 --> 00:41:55,692
Dude, I think
United Data Group

621
00:41:55,692 --> 00:41:57,389
is one of several
call centers.

622
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:59,260
So there's got to be
like a central office

623
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,523
that's controlling
all of them,

624
00:42:00,523 --> 00:42:01,741
and that's what
we got to find.

625
00:42:02,263 --> 00:42:03,656
Wiley, this could be like

626
00:42:03,656 --> 00:42:05,615
a billion-dollar-a-year
operation.

627
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:07,747
- Hello?
- Hey!

628
00:42:07,747 --> 00:42:09,575
Did you hear a single word
I just said?

629
00:42:09,575 --> 00:42:10,576
Yeah.

630
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,406
And?

631
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,929
I was just thinking
you come in here,

632
00:42:15,929 --> 00:42:17,278
hungover on your day off,

633
00:42:17,278 --> 00:42:18,758
and gain more yardage
on this thing

634
00:42:18,758 --> 00:42:20,412
than the whole squad has
in two years.

635
00:42:21,326 --> 00:42:24,242
Yeah, well,
they fucked with my family.

636
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,332
What'd you get on Clay?

637
00:42:27,332 --> 00:42:28,725
- Your beekeeper?
- Yeah.

638
00:42:28,725 --> 00:42:29,900
He's a ghost.

639
00:42:30,988 --> 00:42:32,293
What?

640
00:42:32,293 --> 00:42:34,034
Yeah, all I have
is a birth certificate

641
00:42:34,034 --> 00:42:35,035
and a social.

642
00:42:35,732 --> 00:42:37,168
- The guy's never even

643
00:42:37,168 --> 00:42:38,256
had a bank account,

644
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:40,563
credit card, flown on a plane.

645
00:42:41,085 --> 00:42:42,739
I ran his prints through
every database

646
00:42:42,739 --> 00:42:44,349
I can think of, no hits.

647
00:42:45,655 --> 00:42:46,917
That's bullshit.

648
00:42:46,917 --> 00:42:48,266
This dude is former military
all day.

649
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:50,442
No hits. I'm telling you.

650
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:51,617
Either he's never
been printed,

651
00:42:51,617 --> 00:42:54,315
or Adam Clay doesn't exist.

652
00:42:55,621 --> 00:42:57,318
Which is terrifying to me

653
00:42:57,318 --> 00:42:59,233
because he's probably
in a classified program.

654
00:43:01,758 --> 00:43:03,150
Special Agent Wiley.

655
00:43:05,109 --> 00:43:06,414
Okay.

656
00:43:06,414 --> 00:43:07,938
- Let's go.
- What?

657
00:43:07,938 --> 00:43:10,244
- They found the guy, Garnett.
- What?

658
00:43:10,244 --> 00:43:12,290
- They found him. Let's go.
- Oh, shit.

659
00:43:15,032 --> 00:43:16,642
- Jessica.

660
00:43:16,642 --> 00:43:17,991
<i>I think you know
why I'm calling.</i>

661
00:43:18,949 --> 00:43:21,299
You know,
I'd do anything for you.

662
00:43:22,256 --> 00:43:24,998
Anything for you.

663
00:43:25,912 --> 00:43:27,261
Derek's scared shitless.

664
00:43:27,261 --> 00:43:28,959
I've never seen him
this scared.

665
00:43:29,786 --> 00:43:31,439
Well, he's made his bed.

666
00:43:32,745 --> 00:43:34,617
I'll give you a board seat
on the holding company.

667
00:43:34,617 --> 00:43:35,922
That's another million a year.

668
00:43:36,401 --> 00:43:38,621
<i>Plus you promised
you'd take care of him.</i>

669
00:43:40,057 --> 00:43:42,886
Look, I don't need that.
I have enough.

670
00:43:43,626 --> 00:43:44,975
So you got this?

671
00:43:47,412 --> 00:43:49,240
Yeah. You have my word.

672
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:51,068
<i>Wallace...</i>

673
00:43:53,418 --> 00:43:54,637
I still think of you...

674
00:43:55,942 --> 00:43:58,205
<i>- sometimes.
- </i>

675
00:43:58,205 --> 00:43:59,163
Sometimes.

676
00:44:15,179 --> 00:44:16,789
Why are you calling me

677
00:44:16,789 --> 00:44:18,051
on the "never call
this line" line?

678
00:44:18,051 --> 00:44:19,923
This is priority one, Janet.

679
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:21,794
Well, if it was priority one,
I would know about it.

680
00:44:21,794 --> 00:44:23,622
Look, I'm heading downtown
to a POTUS brief.

681
00:44:23,622 --> 00:44:24,667
<i>Just hear me out.</i>

682
00:44:25,276 --> 00:44:26,756
Now, you know who I work for,
don't you?

683
00:44:26,756 --> 00:44:28,801
<i>Oh, yeah.
God help you, Wallace.</i>

684
00:44:28,801 --> 00:44:29,802
Exactly.

685
00:44:30,368 --> 00:44:32,065
Well, Director Harward,

686
00:44:32,065 --> 00:44:33,719
my young friend,
seems to have caught

687
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:35,852
the unwanted attentions of...

688
00:44:36,896 --> 00:44:38,506
I don't know
how else to say this.

689
00:44:38,506 --> 00:44:39,682
Of a Beekeeper.

690
00:44:41,422 --> 00:44:44,208
Wait, a Beekeeper Beekeeper?

691
00:44:44,208 --> 00:44:45,557
As in.

692
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,516
<i>- Well, that's not good.</i>
- No, it's not.

693
00:44:48,516 --> 00:44:51,345
- What's the body count?
<i>- Seven today.</i>

694
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:55,045
You busy making
funeral arrangements?

695
00:44:55,045 --> 00:44:57,395
I need help, Janet. Not jokes.

696
00:45:04,837 --> 00:45:05,838
Is that Garnett?

697
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,014
He was strapped
to an old pickup.

698
00:45:09,059 --> 00:45:09,929
Check this out.

699
00:45:27,381 --> 00:45:29,906
Does this mean you've
taken pity on an old man?

700
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:34,388
So your problem?
He's retired from the program.

701
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:36,260
No longer active.

702
00:45:38,741 --> 00:45:40,743
Well, that changes everything.

703
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:43,746
The current active Beekeeper
is aware of the issue

704
00:45:43,746 --> 00:45:45,443
and is going
to be taking things from here.

705
00:45:45,443 --> 00:45:47,097
You can rest easy, old friend.

706
00:45:47,097 --> 00:45:48,359
<i>Oh, no. Janet.</i>

707
00:45:48,925 --> 00:45:51,405
The current active Beekeeper
is a fucking lunatic

708
00:45:51,405 --> 00:45:53,451
<i>who should have been removed
months ago.</i>

709
00:45:53,451 --> 00:45:54,757
God help us now.

710
00:46:35,275 --> 00:46:36,450
Get out of here!

711
00:46:40,803 --> 00:46:42,282
Shit!

712
00:46:44,241 --> 00:46:46,330
- Excuse me.
- You're cool.

713
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,874
You've been a busy bee.

714
00:47:08,874 --> 00:47:10,745
You're supposed to be retired.

715
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:12,617
I'm assuming
you're my replacement.

716
00:47:44,562 --> 00:47:46,520
Fuck you!

717
00:48:40,096 --> 00:48:41,401
I need your keys.

718
00:48:57,243 --> 00:48:58,679
There's an issue.

719
00:48:59,419 --> 00:49:00,943
The problem
has not been solved.

720
00:49:02,466 --> 00:49:03,467
Well...

721
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:07,036
That is a surprise.

722
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:09,821
The Beekeepers
have studied the situation

723
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:11,954
and have decided
to remain neutral.

724
00:49:12,476 --> 00:49:14,260
How can they do that?

725
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:16,262
He was their man,
for fuck's sake!

726
00:49:16,697 --> 00:49:18,221
<i>I'm sorry, Wallace.</i>

727
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:20,484
You're on your own.

728
00:49:23,617 --> 00:49:25,402
I thought you could
fucking handle this.

729
00:49:25,402 --> 00:49:26,969
I can handle this!

730
00:49:40,373 --> 00:49:41,505
Thank you.

731
00:49:42,506 --> 00:49:44,116
What you got for us,
Detective?

732
00:49:44,725 --> 00:49:46,205
That's her vehicle,

733
00:49:46,205 --> 00:49:48,555
registered
to a Anisette Landress.

734
00:49:48,555 --> 00:49:51,819
The ATF are en route inbound
to take care of it.

735
00:49:51,819 --> 00:49:53,517
We're way cooler than ATF.

736
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:55,649
I'll show you
why I called them.

737
00:50:02,613 --> 00:50:03,962
That's a Minigun.

738
00:50:03,962 --> 00:50:05,659
They use those
on military vehicles.

739
00:50:06,095 --> 00:50:08,662
Did you know that puppy shoots
6,000 rounds a minute?

740
00:50:09,228 --> 00:50:10,664
I know.

741
00:50:10,664 --> 00:50:12,362
Did you know
that's 100 rounds a second?

742
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,016
Yep, I know.

743
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:17,019
Did you know
that you know a lot?

744
00:50:17,019 --> 00:50:18,498
Yes, I do.

745
00:50:18,498 --> 00:50:19,673
It's because
I minored in math.

746
00:50:19,673 --> 00:50:21,197
I'm a pretty smart guy
actually.

747
00:50:21,197 --> 00:50:23,329
Okay, then, do you know
who Anisette Landress is?

748
00:50:23,329 --> 00:50:25,244
- Yes, I do.
- Go ahead and tell me.

749
00:50:25,244 --> 00:50:27,072
Someone who doesn't exist

750
00:50:27,072 --> 00:50:29,379
in any commercial
or government database.

751
00:50:29,379 --> 00:50:30,728
Someone who's a ghost.

752
00:50:30,728 --> 00:50:33,035
Like our good friend
Adam Clay.

753
00:50:35,124 --> 00:50:37,517
<i>"Beekeeping for Beekeepers."</i>

754
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,390
Here's another reason

755
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:41,695
that Anisette Landress

756
00:50:41,695 --> 00:50:43,175
is like our good friend
Adam Clay.

757
00:50:45,612 --> 00:50:47,049
Do you know what's that way?

758
00:50:48,093 --> 00:50:50,704
- Springfield...

759
00:50:50,704 --> 00:50:52,576
...where the call center
was torched.

760
00:50:53,881 --> 00:50:55,622
And that way
where Adam Clay's headed?

761
00:50:57,624 --> 00:50:58,712
Boston.

762
00:50:59,713 --> 00:51:00,845
Let's go.

763
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,891
Thank you.

764
00:51:19,124 --> 00:51:20,343
How are you, my friend?

765
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:22,258
- Good to see you, sir.
- Good to see you.

766
00:51:22,258 --> 00:51:24,521
Yeah, come on,

767
00:51:24,521 --> 00:51:26,000
leave them alone.
Leave them alone.

768
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,741
Don't play with those things.
They go off.

769
00:51:27,741 --> 00:51:29,352
Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

770
00:51:32,268 --> 00:51:34,835
When I was sworn in
as director,

771
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,275
I was read into programs
I never imagined existed.

772
00:51:41,407 --> 00:51:42,626
Well...

773
00:51:44,193 --> 00:51:48,849
there are programs
even I wasn't privy to.

774
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:52,026
Like the Beekeepers.

775
00:51:53,898 --> 00:51:57,031
The honeybee has always

776
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:59,121
had a special relationship
with humanity.

777
00:51:59,121 --> 00:52:00,644
A sacred relationship.

778
00:52:01,558 --> 00:52:04,256
Why? No bees, no agriculture.

779
00:52:04,256 --> 00:52:06,432
No agriculture,
no civilization.

780
00:52:06,954 --> 00:52:10,741
Our nation is not
unlike a beehive,

781
00:52:10,741 --> 00:52:13,918
with its complex systems
of workers,

782
00:52:13,918 --> 00:52:15,920
caretakers, even royalty.

783
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:20,054
If any of the beehive's
complex mechanisms

784
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:21,186
are compromised,

785
00:52:21,926 --> 00:52:24,146
the hive collapses.

786
00:52:25,495 --> 00:52:27,192
Someone
a long time ago decided

787
00:52:27,192 --> 00:52:29,412
that a mechanism was needed

788
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:30,891
to keep our nation safe.

789
00:52:30,891 --> 00:52:33,459
A mechanism
outside the chain of command,

790
00:52:33,459 --> 00:52:36,070
outside the system.

791
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:41,946
Its one mission,
to keep the system safe.

792
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:45,689
Beekeepers are given
all resources,

793
00:52:45,689 --> 00:52:49,910
empowered to act
on their own judgment.

794
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:52,391
For decades,
they have quietly worked

795
00:52:52,391 --> 00:52:54,654
to keep the hive safe.

796
00:52:55,699 --> 00:52:58,049
That is, until now.

797
00:52:59,398 --> 00:53:02,271
It appears
that a retired Beekeeper

798
00:53:02,271 --> 00:53:03,663
has gone off program

799
00:53:03,663 --> 00:53:06,666
and is acting
in what he mistakenly believes

800
00:53:06,666 --> 00:53:09,060
is the hive's best interest.

801
00:53:10,235 --> 00:53:11,541
Can't somebody just
pick up the phone

802
00:53:11,541 --> 00:53:13,673
and tell this yahoo
to stand-the-fuck down?

803
00:53:13,673 --> 00:53:15,893
That's the one thing
Beekeepers don't do.

804
00:53:15,893 --> 00:53:17,286
Stand down.

805
00:53:17,677 --> 00:53:19,853
Not unlike bees themselves,

806
00:53:19,853 --> 00:53:23,466
Beekeepers keep working
until they die.

807
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:25,250
So he's basically one of us.

808
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:28,340
No. He's not like you.

809
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:30,037
You're tier one operators,

810
00:53:30,777 --> 00:53:33,215
former SEAL Team Six,
Delta Group.

811
00:53:34,999 --> 00:53:38,394
You are, in other words, pussies.

812
00:53:38,394 --> 00:53:40,483
- If you were in the same room,

813
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:41,614
he would kill you.

814
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:46,619
With enough of you,
then maybe you just might

815
00:53:46,619 --> 00:53:49,100
in fact be able to kill him

816
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,276
before he accomplishes
his goal.

817
00:53:51,276 --> 00:53:52,625
What would that be?

818
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:57,195
To kill his way
to the top of the hive.

819
00:54:00,242 --> 00:54:02,809
Mr. Pettis, you should
get your people moving.

820
00:54:11,296 --> 00:54:13,472
Dude, bees are interesting
little shits.

821
00:54:13,472 --> 00:54:14,865
Did you know that?

822
00:54:14,865 --> 00:54:16,954
I know they pollinate
a bunch of shit

823
00:54:16,954 --> 00:54:18,347
and we'd be fucked
without them.

824
00:54:18,347 --> 00:54:19,304
Listen.

825
00:54:20,087 --> 00:54:21,524
"Some bees are queen slayers,

826
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:23,090
"which will rise up
and kill their queen

827
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:24,570
"if she fails to produce

828
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:26,224
"the right kind
of male offspring."

829
00:54:27,312 --> 00:54:28,705
Fascinating.

830
00:54:29,923 --> 00:54:31,925
- No.
- Hm. Nope.

831
00:54:31,925 --> 00:54:33,231
- No.
- No!

832
00:54:33,231 --> 00:54:34,537
- It's your turn. You can't...
- No!

833
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,023
Special Agent Parker.

834
00:54:44,677 --> 00:54:46,026
Yeah.

835
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:48,028
Okay.

836
00:54:48,028 --> 00:54:49,029
Thank you.

837
00:54:52,685 --> 00:54:53,730
What?

838
00:54:55,297 --> 00:54:57,647
The deputy director is flying
up from DC to see us.

839
00:55:00,954 --> 00:55:03,870
Oh, fuck. This is your fault.

840
00:56:35,832 --> 00:56:37,790
Here's another
interesting factoid.

841
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:39,139
Thank fuck.

842
00:56:39,139 --> 00:56:41,185
You know,
I was getting sick of enjoying

843
00:56:41,185 --> 00:56:42,360
my peaceful thoughts.

844
00:56:45,581 --> 00:56:46,973
Sir.

845
00:56:46,973 --> 00:56:48,627
Sir,
this is Special Agent Parker,

846
00:56:48,627 --> 00:56:49,889
Special Agent Wiley.

847
00:56:49,889 --> 00:56:51,413
They'll be briefing you.

848
00:56:51,413 --> 00:56:52,849
This is Deputy Director Prigg

849
00:56:52,849 --> 00:56:55,286
and Amanda Munoz,
special counsel.

850
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:56,722
Mr. Deputy Director,

851
00:56:57,331 --> 00:56:58,855
my colleague and I believe

852
00:56:58,855 --> 00:57:00,900
that three major crime scenes
in our area

853
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,815
are connected
to a single subject.

854
00:57:02,815 --> 00:57:03,903
Adam Clay.

855
00:57:03,903 --> 00:57:05,383
He killed six people today.

856
00:57:05,383 --> 00:57:08,081
Based on the extensive
use of tradecraft

857
00:57:08,081 --> 00:57:09,692
and the nature of his alias,

858
00:57:10,214 --> 00:57:11,694
we believe
that Mr. Clay is connected

859
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:14,087
to a classified program
named Beekeeper.

860
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:16,873
A program that none
of our partner agencies

861
00:57:16,873 --> 00:57:18,048
seem willing to acknowledge.

862
00:57:18,527 --> 00:57:20,354
Let's stick to what we know,
Special Agent Parker.

863
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:22,574
Yes, sir.

864
00:57:23,227 --> 00:57:25,621
In any event, this individual
is highly capable

865
00:57:25,621 --> 00:57:27,100
and extremely motivated,

866
00:57:27,492 --> 00:57:29,363
and we believe that he's
on his way to Boston,

867
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:30,756
if not already here.

868
00:57:30,756 --> 00:57:33,846
And we believe
that this is his next target,

869
00:57:33,846 --> 00:57:35,369
Nine Star United,

870
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:37,110
which appears to be the entity

871
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:38,677
operating the regional
call centers,

872
00:57:38,677 --> 00:57:40,505
like the one
that Mr. Clay burned down.

873
00:57:41,071 --> 00:57:43,465
Why is Adam Clay
on this rampage?

874
00:57:44,814 --> 00:57:48,774
He's, um,
protecting the hive, sir.

875
00:57:49,427 --> 00:57:50,689
It's what Beekeepers do.

876
00:57:51,211 --> 00:57:52,604
I have enough
to brief the director.

877
00:57:53,649 --> 00:57:55,520
- What's your ask?
My ask?

878
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:58,697
Uh, well, a SWAT team,
for starters.

879
00:57:59,219 --> 00:58:01,831
Surveillance support,
additional agents, analysts.

880
00:58:02,658 --> 00:58:04,050
That shouldn't be a problem.

881
00:58:04,442 --> 00:58:05,443
Thank you.

882
00:58:13,146 --> 00:58:15,322
- Did that just happen?
- Yeah.

883
00:58:22,242 --> 00:58:23,461
All right.
Everybody, listen up.

884
00:58:23,461 --> 00:58:24,723
It's roll call time.

885
00:58:24,723 --> 00:58:27,073
I'm getting ready
for my dick to get hard

886
00:58:27,073 --> 00:58:29,772
with some wonderful,
beautiful numbers.

887
00:58:29,772 --> 00:58:31,687
Let's start with Phoenix.
Where we at?

888
00:58:31,687 --> 00:58:33,776
Phoenix is up 201K.

889
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:36,169
200K, I'm gonna
suck your dick. I love you.

890
00:58:36,169 --> 00:58:38,041
- New Orleans, show me,

891
00:58:38,041 --> 00:58:39,608
tell me. Where we at?

892
00:58:39,608 --> 00:58:41,000
It's down 93K, boss.

893
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,002
Down? You're a fucking loser.

894
00:58:43,002 --> 00:58:44,787
You give me
a fucking headache.

895
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:45,918
You give me fucking cancer.

896
00:58:45,918 --> 00:58:48,007
New York, make me happy.
I beg you.

897
00:58:48,007 --> 00:58:51,271
New York City's up 64 ASCOT.

898
00:58:51,271 --> 00:58:53,883
Yeah! I love you, New York!

899
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:02,587
Gather around!

900
00:59:02,587 --> 00:59:04,458
I want all weapons
front on entry.

901
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:06,156
- Everybody give me an oos!
Oos!

902
00:59:06,156 --> 00:59:07,244
Let's go!

903
00:59:12,292 --> 00:59:15,252
Power down, my federal friend.
Power down.

904
00:59:15,252 --> 00:59:17,515
Private security here
on the orders of the Governor.

905
00:59:17,515 --> 00:59:19,517
State Department certified
to carry weapons

906
00:59:19,517 --> 00:59:20,605
in all 50 states.

907
00:59:22,215 --> 00:59:23,695
Feel free to call
the highlighted numbers

908
00:59:23,695 --> 00:59:24,827
to verify.

909
00:59:25,392 --> 00:59:27,612
You're not welcome here.
Get the fuck out.

910
00:59:28,744 --> 00:59:30,397
All right, boys, let's go!

911
00:59:32,704 --> 00:59:34,576
Set up a perimeter outside.

912
00:59:35,141 --> 00:59:37,796
Your goals, they mean bonuses.

913
00:59:37,796 --> 00:59:39,972
Money, money, money,
we fucking love it.

914
00:59:41,278 --> 00:59:43,541
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What the fuck?

915
00:59:43,541 --> 00:59:45,630
Who the fuck are you?
You can't be in here.

916
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:47,458
We're the guys
keeping you alive.

917
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:48,851
Shut it down now.

918
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:50,461
Everybody, listen up.

919
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:51,941
Anyone who's
not carrying a weapon,

920
00:59:51,941 --> 00:59:53,464
get the fuck out!

921
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:54,944
Shouldn't you be killing
bin Laden or something?

922
00:59:54,944 --> 00:59:58,643
Listen to me, my friend.
This place prints money.

923
00:59:58,643 --> 01:00:00,427
No one's shutting down.

924
01:00:00,427 --> 01:00:03,866
Anybody so much as puts
a phone down, they're fired!

925
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:06,129
I'm sorry to break it to you,

926
01:00:06,129 --> 01:00:07,696
but bin Laden's been dead
for a while.

927
01:00:07,696 --> 01:00:10,002
So I'm going to say this
one last time.

928
01:00:10,002 --> 01:00:11,264
Shut it down.

929
01:00:12,222 --> 01:00:13,440
The fuck I am.

930
01:00:14,137 --> 01:00:16,182
Call your fucking boss.

931
01:00:16,182 --> 01:00:17,444
You want me to call my boss?

932
01:00:18,315 --> 01:00:19,359
I'll do that.

933
01:00:20,056 --> 01:00:24,495
And you'll be so fucked,
it's gonna be beautiful.

934
01:00:26,323 --> 01:00:27,716
Don't be shy. Come on.

935
01:00:28,978 --> 01:00:30,762
What about the parking garage?

936
01:00:30,762 --> 01:00:32,677
Closed and locked. Steel gate.

937
01:00:32,677 --> 01:00:34,244
I want a body on comms
watching it.

938
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:36,768
- Delivery dock?
- Same deal.

939
01:00:36,768 --> 01:00:38,727
- Station an agent there too.
- Yes, sir.

940
01:00:38,727 --> 01:00:40,859
Sure there's no back entrances
into this place?

941
01:00:40,859 --> 01:00:42,339
Hey,
there're no other entrances.

942
01:00:42,339 --> 01:00:44,646
Federal law enforcement
operation in progress.

943
01:00:44,646 --> 01:00:45,908
Move along
at a minimum retreat

944
01:00:45,908 --> 01:00:47,344
to a safe distance.
Thank you.

945
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:48,780
Someone scout
the service tunnel.

946
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:51,696
The other option,
instead of going in

947
01:00:51,696 --> 01:00:53,045
is to smoke them out.

948
01:00:53,045 --> 01:00:54,351
Excuse me?

949
01:00:54,351 --> 01:00:56,222
I figured I'd give
the firefighters a break.

950
01:00:57,484 --> 01:00:59,182
I've put them through
enough already.

951
01:00:59,182 --> 01:01:00,749
What'd you say your name was?

952
01:01:00,749 --> 01:01:02,359
Currently I go by Adam Clay.

953
01:01:03,012 --> 01:01:04,970
Trust me,
if there was a back entrance,

954
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:06,232
I would've used it.

955
01:01:06,232 --> 01:01:07,712
I don't want to injure anyone

956
01:01:07,712 --> 01:01:08,887
who's innocent
and non-involved.

957
01:01:10,019 --> 01:01:11,498
But it is what it is.

958
01:01:12,064 --> 01:01:13,631
- Somebody detain this guy!

959
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:41,441
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

960
01:01:51,843 --> 01:01:53,671
Oh, wow,
if it isn't the fucking

961
01:01:53,671 --> 01:01:55,064
golden goose himself.

962
01:01:55,064 --> 01:01:56,761
Sir, I got
Captain Caveman here

963
01:01:56,761 --> 01:01:58,937
telling me
to send everyone home.

964
01:01:58,937 --> 01:02:00,112
If we do that,

965
01:02:00,112 --> 01:02:01,723
we're walking away
from a lot of money.

966
01:02:01,723 --> 01:02:03,289
Mm. Put him on.

967
01:02:04,464 --> 01:02:05,509
It's for you.

968
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:09,034
Why are you fucking
with my business?

969
01:02:09,034 --> 01:02:10,819
Because Mr. Westwyld hired me

970
01:02:10,819 --> 01:02:12,864
to kick some
fucking Beekeeper's ass.

971
01:02:13,735 --> 01:02:15,780
Mr. Westwyld works for me,

972
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:17,956
which means
that you work for me.

973
01:02:18,696 --> 01:02:19,915
Now, listen, that place

974
01:02:19,915 --> 01:02:21,786
is the crown jewel
of my kingdom.

975
01:02:22,482 --> 01:02:23,919
I'm not gonna
let some crash test dummy

976
01:02:23,919 --> 01:02:25,311
with a fucking gun fuck it up.

977
01:02:25,311 --> 01:02:27,139
Is that clear, Mr. Pettis?

978
01:02:27,139 --> 01:02:28,314
Didn't this character
already burn

979
01:02:28,314 --> 01:02:29,794
one of your centers
to the ground?

980
01:02:29,794 --> 01:02:31,665
Well, you know,
they didn't have you,

981
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:32,928
and that's why.

982
01:02:32,928 --> 01:02:35,104
So maybe you just
do your fucking job

983
01:02:35,104 --> 01:02:37,236
and don't tell me
how to do mine, please.

984
01:02:37,236 --> 01:02:39,064
<i>- We got it?</i>
- Copy that.

985
01:02:41,197 --> 01:02:43,721
Fall out.
Set up a perimeter outside.

986
01:02:43,721 --> 01:02:45,157
Let's go. Move!

987
01:02:45,157 --> 01:02:46,985
- Round of applause.

988
01:02:46,985 --> 01:02:48,900
Let's say goodbye
to our good friends.

989
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:52,338
Bye-bye, Admiral.
Go join fucking Space Force.

990
01:02:52,338 --> 01:02:55,820
You are beautiful.
Now get the fuck out!

991
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:57,256
Keep walking.

992
01:02:57,256 --> 01:02:58,780
Bye-bye, dickhead.

993
01:02:59,998 --> 01:03:02,479
What a bunch of jackoffs.

994
01:03:02,479 --> 01:03:04,176
Yeah, we love you!

995
01:03:14,970 --> 01:03:16,580
One time amnesty.

996
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:18,190
Whoever doesn't want to die
this evening,

997
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:21,628
can in an orderly fashion
leave now.

998
01:03:22,151 --> 01:03:24,022
Uh, uh, uh. No fucking way.
It's not happening.

999
01:03:24,022 --> 01:03:25,807
Anybody moves, you're fired.

1000
01:03:25,807 --> 01:03:28,200
- No bonus, vesting, two weeks.
- Come on, boys! Move, move!

1001
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,288
Nada. Zero!

1002
01:03:30,202 --> 01:03:31,856
Are you fucking nuts?

1003
01:03:31,856 --> 01:03:33,553
Each one of these
pricks is worth

1004
01:03:33,553 --> 01:03:35,555
30 to 40 million a year
in profit.

1005
01:03:35,555 --> 01:03:38,210
So no one is shooting no guns.

1006
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:40,691
Not a good day to drag
innocent people into this.

1007
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:42,606
These assholes?
They're not innocent.

1008
01:03:42,606 --> 01:03:44,826
For either one of us
to close that distance,

1009
01:03:44,826 --> 01:03:46,523
some of them will get hurt.

1010
01:03:46,523 --> 01:03:48,351
Let's start with this prick
right here.

1011
01:04:03,322 --> 01:04:04,454
On me!

1012
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:14,681
Take right!

1013
01:04:30,001 --> 01:04:31,394
Pettis, we got a man down.

1014
01:04:53,416 --> 01:04:54,896
<i>Fire. Fire.</i>

1015
01:04:57,289 --> 01:04:58,551
<i>Fire. Fire.</i>

1016
01:05:05,123 --> 01:05:07,038
You know
who you're working for?

1017
01:05:07,647 --> 01:05:09,258
None of my fucking business.

1018
01:05:09,258 --> 01:05:11,260
I'm just the guy they call
when there's a problem.

1019
01:05:15,394 --> 01:05:17,179
And you are our problem.

1020
01:05:17,701 --> 01:05:19,572
Goddamn right, I'm a problem.

1021
01:05:42,595 --> 01:05:44,380
<i>Fire. Fire.</i>

1022
01:05:46,512 --> 01:05:48,427
<i>Fire. Fire.</i>

1023
01:05:58,481 --> 01:05:59,873
Dan, what the hell happened?

1024
01:06:00,787 --> 01:06:01,963
Any dead?

1025
01:06:01,963 --> 01:06:03,790
Not dead,
but we got our asses kicked.

1026
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:06,315
- Our guy. What do we know?
He's in the building.

1027
01:06:06,315 --> 01:06:07,707
I'm waiting more men
to roll in.

1028
01:06:08,186 --> 01:06:09,579
I don't know what this guy is,

1029
01:06:09,579 --> 01:06:11,102
but nobody can do
what he's done.

1030
01:06:11,102 --> 01:06:12,930
He's just a Beekeeper.

1031
01:06:14,149 --> 01:06:15,411
Bad idea.

1032
01:06:17,021 --> 01:06:18,153
I'm not waiting.

1033
01:06:18,153 --> 01:06:19,458
V, wait!
- Move!

1034
01:06:19,458 --> 01:06:20,633
Come on, Wiley, keep up.

1035
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:22,331
Fuck.

1036
01:06:35,692 --> 01:06:36,998
We got him!

1037
01:06:48,226 --> 01:06:49,967
- You done?
- Reload.

1038
01:06:56,147 --> 01:06:57,453
Everybody out!

1039
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:10,335
You're done.

1040
01:07:27,439 --> 01:07:28,527
We should take the stairs.

1041
01:07:29,050 --> 01:07:30,051
Smart.

1042
01:07:30,834 --> 01:07:32,923
<i>Subject is in the hallway.</i>

1043
01:07:34,577 --> 01:07:36,709
<i>Command, report back.
Anybody on comm?</i>

1044
01:07:47,807 --> 01:07:49,853
Please, please don't kill me.

1045
01:07:49,853 --> 01:07:53,248
I'm just a middle manager.
I never hurt nobody.

1046
01:07:53,857 --> 01:07:55,511
I'd respect you more
if you look people

1047
01:07:55,511 --> 01:07:57,513
in their eyes
when you steal from them.

1048
01:08:09,786 --> 01:08:11,396
Now, you're making
a lot of money here.

1049
01:08:12,441 --> 01:08:14,007
Tell me where it's all going.

1050
01:08:14,443 --> 01:08:15,444
I don't know, man.

1051
01:08:19,665 --> 01:08:21,319
- I know you're the middle man.

1052
01:08:21,319 --> 01:08:25,193
- Who's above you?
- No. They'll kill me.

1053
01:08:29,153 --> 01:08:30,937
I'll torture you,
then kill you.

1054
01:08:36,595 --> 01:08:37,988
Come on, guys. You got it.

1055
01:08:37,988 --> 01:08:40,251
Wiley,
get your ass up here!

1056
01:08:40,251 --> 01:08:43,167
Yeah, well,
I'm not an Olympian.

1057
01:08:43,167 --> 01:08:45,082
Make it stop.

1058
01:08:45,082 --> 01:08:46,475
You can make it stop.

1059
01:08:47,345 --> 01:08:49,608
You've stolen
hundreds of millions

1060
01:08:49,608 --> 01:08:50,914
from people
who've done nothing

1061
01:08:50,914 --> 01:08:52,307
but work hard all their lives.

1062
01:08:57,138 --> 01:08:59,575
- She was an educator, a mom.

1063
01:08:59,575 --> 01:09:01,838
Dedicated her whole life
to helping people.

1064
01:09:04,014 --> 01:09:05,581
Yesterday, she shot herself

1065
01:09:06,973 --> 01:09:09,454
because you took two million
from a charity she ran.

1066
01:09:14,938 --> 01:09:17,201
She was the only person
who ever took care of me.

1067
01:09:21,205 --> 01:09:23,512
Who and where, Mr. Anzalone?

1068
01:09:24,252 --> 01:09:26,341
- Tell me who and where.
- I can't.

1069
01:09:26,341 --> 01:09:27,559
Look, these people,

1070
01:09:27,559 --> 01:09:29,126
they're untouchable.
I can't...

1071
01:09:29,126 --> 01:09:31,694
No, please! Please!
Stop! I will! I will!

1072
01:09:32,173 --> 01:09:34,131
Let me show you.
Let me show you.

1073
01:09:52,584 --> 01:09:54,195
I told you
they were untouchable.

1074
01:09:56,197 --> 01:09:57,546
Nobody's untouchable.

1075
01:10:01,637 --> 01:10:03,813
Sometimes when the hive's
out of balance...

1076
01:10:06,163 --> 01:10:07,599
you have to replace the queen.

1077
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:14,345
Clay!

1078
01:10:17,653 --> 01:10:19,568
That man is directly
responsible

1079
01:10:19,568 --> 01:10:20,743
for your mother's death.

1080
01:10:24,312 --> 01:10:25,443
I believe you.

1081
01:10:26,314 --> 01:10:28,446
But we have laws
for these things.

1082
01:10:31,449 --> 01:10:33,843
You have laws for these things
until they fail.

1083
01:10:35,932 --> 01:10:37,107
Then you have me.

1084
01:10:47,422 --> 01:10:48,771
Arrest him!

1085
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:51,252
On your feet before I blow
your fucking head off.

1086
01:10:51,252 --> 01:10:53,297
I just been thrown through
a plate glass window.

1087
01:10:53,297 --> 01:10:54,385
Shut your fucking mouth!

1088
01:11:07,659 --> 01:11:09,661
- Whoa. I have four kids.

1089
01:11:11,315 --> 01:11:14,013
I know. Three boys and a girl.

1090
01:11:26,591 --> 01:11:28,854
Wiley? You okay?

1091
01:11:28,854 --> 01:11:30,726
- Yeah. He went that way.
You okay?

1092
01:11:30,726 --> 01:11:32,118
- Have you been hit?
- My wife thinks

1093
01:11:32,118 --> 01:11:33,424
I'm doing computer nerd shit.

1094
01:11:33,424 --> 01:11:34,860
Well, I won't tell her
if you don't.

1095
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:36,253
- Have you been hit?
- No, I'm good, Mom.

1096
01:11:36,253 --> 01:11:37,515
Did you get him?

1097
01:11:37,515 --> 01:11:39,343
- Did you?
- No, he's tricky.

1098
01:11:39,343 --> 01:11:41,040
- Get up. You okay?
- Almost, but...

1099
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,564
I guess that's just evidence.

1100
01:11:42,564 --> 01:11:45,131
- Can I borrow your gun?
- Yeah. Let's go.

1101
01:11:45,131 --> 01:11:46,785
- On me. On me. On me. On me.
Clear!

1102
01:11:54,402 --> 01:11:56,186
I want interviews
with all of them.

1103
01:12:02,671 --> 01:12:03,715
We're going to talk.

1104
01:12:04,629 --> 01:12:05,717
Get him out of here.

1105
01:12:23,256 --> 01:12:24,475
Wiley.

1106
01:12:32,091 --> 01:12:33,136
Holy shit.

1107
01:12:44,452 --> 01:12:45,844
Do you mind
if I ask you

1108
01:12:45,844 --> 01:12:47,063
a really boring question?

1109
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:49,935
Do you actually prefer
the money or the power?

1110
01:12:50,675 --> 01:12:51,807
Mm.

1111
01:12:51,807 --> 01:12:52,938
That's deep.

1112
01:12:53,548 --> 01:12:55,071
- Oh, I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

1113
01:12:57,595 --> 01:12:59,554
Oh, God. Uh...

1114
01:12:59,554 --> 01:13:01,556
Would you excuse me
for a moment? Come upstairs.

1115
01:13:05,516 --> 01:13:08,301
<i>You said these guys
were the fucking best. Uh...</i>

1116
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:09,346
Why are they all dead?

1117
01:13:10,521 --> 01:13:11,914
You kicked the beehive

1118
01:13:11,914 --> 01:13:14,090
and now we have
to reap the whirlwind.

1119
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:18,486
- Unless...
-  Unless.

1120
01:13:18,486 --> 01:13:20,270
Unless, unless,
unless fucking what?

1121
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:23,665
Maybe now is the time
to call your mother.

1122
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:28,104
I'm paying you
so much fucking money

1123
01:13:28,104 --> 01:13:29,497
and your advice
is to call my mother?

1124
01:13:30,541 --> 01:13:33,457
He can't make his move on us

1125
01:13:33,457 --> 01:13:35,894
if we're in her proximity,
can he?

1126
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:37,461
Her people.

1127
01:13:44,773 --> 01:13:45,861
You're a fuck.

1128
01:13:46,514 --> 01:13:48,298
- You're scared...
- I certainly am scared.

1129
01:13:48,298 --> 01:13:49,517
...and you want
to use my mother

1130
01:13:49,517 --> 01:13:50,692
as a human shield.

1131
01:13:50,692 --> 01:13:52,781
Just call her.
Just call her. Come on.

1132
01:13:53,651 --> 01:13:55,348
It's not a game now.

1133
01:13:55,348 --> 01:13:56,437
Oh, it's all a game.

1134
01:13:56,959 --> 01:13:58,308
Come on.

1135
01:13:59,048 --> 01:14:00,789
Yes, Derek. What do you want?

1136
01:14:00,789 --> 01:14:02,791
<i>Hey, Mom. No, nothing.</i>

1137
01:14:02,791 --> 01:14:04,619
<i>I was just, you know,
thinking about you.</i>

1138
01:14:04,619 --> 01:14:07,230
<i>I miss you. I was hoping
to maybe see you this weekend.</i>

1139
01:14:07,926 --> 01:14:09,275
I'm at the beach house.

1140
01:14:09,275 --> 01:14:10,581
You're welcome to join
if you behave.

1141
01:14:11,321 --> 01:14:13,366
<i>I would love to. And, hey,
I actually was going to,</i>

1142
01:14:13,366 --> 01:14:14,846
<i>you know,
get together with some of my</i>

1143
01:14:14,846 --> 01:14:16,152
<i>tech homies and stuff,
if that's, uh,</i>

1144
01:14:16,152 --> 01:14:17,588
<i>if that's cool with you.</i>

1145
01:14:17,588 --> 01:14:19,155
Fine. No drugs.

1146
01:14:19,155 --> 01:14:21,157
Give Kelly the details.
Love you. Have to go.

1147
01:14:22,506 --> 01:14:23,855
Derek's joining me
this weekend.

1148
01:14:23,855 --> 01:14:25,117
Help me keep him sober.

1149
01:14:25,117 --> 01:14:26,554
Yes, ma'am.
I love babysitting.

1150
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:28,947
Madame President, Funmi Lawal.

1151
01:14:28,947 --> 01:14:30,688
Hello. Good to meet you.

1152
01:14:30,688 --> 01:14:32,037
Sola Oyemade.

1153
01:14:32,037 --> 01:14:33,517
Sola, thank you so much
for coming.

1154
01:14:33,517 --> 01:14:34,866
Susan Aneno.

1155
01:14:34,866 --> 01:14:36,520
Thank you so much
for coming all this way.

1156
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:37,652
Oli Ray-Imanuel.

1157
01:14:38,174 --> 01:14:40,219
- Oli, how good to meet you.
- Great to meet you, ma'am.

1158
01:14:47,009 --> 01:14:48,793
You don't have to do this,
you know?

1159
01:14:50,447 --> 01:14:52,057
Why not let Clay do his thing?

1160
01:14:54,451 --> 01:14:56,453
Your mom is dead
because of these people.

1161
01:15:04,853 --> 01:15:06,202
Wherever it's headed...

1162
01:15:07,856 --> 01:15:08,944
I swore an oath.

1163
01:15:10,206 --> 01:15:12,425
I can't stand by
and watch it happen.

1164
01:15:19,737 --> 01:15:20,912
Even if he's right?

1165
01:15:27,223 --> 01:15:28,311
Even if he's right.

1166
01:15:31,009 --> 01:15:33,708
<i>Apologies.
Damn plane was delayed.</i>

1167
01:15:33,708 --> 01:15:34,752
<i>What have you got?</i>

1168
01:15:35,274 --> 01:15:38,539
We think we have a sense
of Mr. Clay's true intentions.

1169
01:15:38,539 --> 01:15:40,932
He seems to be
following the money.

1170
01:15:41,977 --> 01:15:43,239
<i>What money is that?</i>

1171
01:15:43,761 --> 01:15:46,938
Usually it's from people
with no heirs, no family.

1172
01:15:46,938 --> 01:15:49,593
Nine Star United uses
data mining software

1173
01:15:49,593 --> 01:15:52,683
to identify these people
and then target their assets.

1174
01:15:53,379 --> 01:15:56,469
There's another
company involved, sir,

1175
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:58,994
a company who is a vendor
to the intelligence community

1176
01:15:58,994 --> 01:16:00,386
and to the Justice Department.

1177
01:16:00,386 --> 01:16:02,519
In fact,
we use this company's software

1178
01:16:02,519 --> 01:16:04,129
in this very office

1179
01:16:04,129 --> 01:16:06,697
to identify financial fraud.

1180
01:16:08,525 --> 01:16:10,440
<i>Are you going to tell me
the name of this company?</i>

1181
01:16:16,098 --> 01:16:18,361
Danforth Enterprises.

1182
01:16:18,361 --> 01:16:21,712
With an annual revenue
of $10 billion,

1183
01:16:21,712 --> 01:16:25,760
founded and operated
by Jessica Danforth,

1184
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:28,240
who recently stepped down
because she was sworn in

1185
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:30,765
as President
of the United States.

1186
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:33,158
<i>She self-financed
her campaign.</i>

1187
01:16:33,158 --> 01:16:35,857
Yeah.
None of that money was clean.

1188
01:16:36,248 --> 01:16:37,510
<i>Who else knows this?</i>

1189
01:16:38,990 --> 01:16:40,296
Us three.

1190
01:16:40,296 --> 01:16:42,820
I have a really bad memory, sir.

1191
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:45,823
<i>Let's, uh,
keep the circle small,</i>

1192
01:16:45,823 --> 01:16:48,086
<i>until I can brief the director
and the attorney general.</i>

1193
01:16:48,086 --> 01:16:50,088
<i>Not a word of this to anyone.
Understood?</i>

1194
01:16:50,088 --> 01:16:51,481
Yes, sir.

1195
01:16:51,481 --> 01:16:53,048
<i>And, Mr. Clay,
I see his kill count</i>

1196
01:16:53,048 --> 01:16:54,615
<i>is steadily rising.</i>

1197
01:16:54,615 --> 01:16:55,920
In a beehive,
there is something

1198
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,400
called a "queen slayer."

1199
01:16:57,792 --> 01:17:00,882
It's a bee that will rise up
and kill the queen

1200
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:04,102
if she produces
defective offspring.

1201
01:17:04,102 --> 01:17:06,539
<i>I thought we were sticking
to the known knowns.</i>

1202
01:17:06,539 --> 01:17:09,586
Right. Yes.
Not that Beekeepers exist.

1203
01:17:09,586 --> 01:17:12,589
But Mr. Clay
does keep honey bees.

1204
01:17:12,589 --> 01:17:14,678
He admires their willingness

1205
01:17:14,678 --> 01:17:17,333
to sacrifice themselves
for the greater good.

1206
01:17:18,943 --> 01:17:22,860
Our concern is that Clay
believes that Derek Danforth

1207
01:17:23,339 --> 01:17:25,646
is the defective offspring
of a queen,

1208
01:17:26,298 --> 01:17:29,301
thereby Clay will strike
at the heart of the problem

1209
01:17:29,301 --> 01:17:31,521
and become a queen slayer.

1210
01:17:33,479 --> 01:17:36,744
<i>Adam Clay's next victim
is Derek Danforth's mother?</i>

1211
01:17:37,614 --> 01:17:39,747
President Danforth, sir.

1212
01:17:40,138 --> 01:17:42,793
<i>You have a blank check.
Good luck.</i>

1213
01:17:44,708 --> 01:17:45,883
Thank you.

1214
01:18:02,030 --> 01:18:03,814
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa. This is a private event.

1215
01:18:03,814 --> 01:18:06,034
I'm gonna need you
to turn around, go away.

1216
01:18:06,034 --> 01:18:07,905
Federal Bureau of something
or another.

1217
01:18:07,905 --> 01:18:09,559
We're good.
We have invites right here.

1218
01:18:09,559 --> 01:18:11,256
All right. You'll need
to excuse my partner.

1219
01:18:11,256 --> 01:18:13,084
He's recently concussed
and hasn't slept in two days.

1220
01:18:13,084 --> 01:18:13,998
We're on the access list.

1221
01:18:14,956 --> 01:18:16,697
We're good, boss.

1222
01:18:44,812 --> 01:18:46,727
Get the Secret Service
out of the house.

1223
01:18:46,727 --> 01:18:47,902
I don't want them here.

1224
01:18:47,902 --> 01:18:49,904
They're C team.
B team at best.

1225
01:18:50,513 --> 01:18:53,124
Uh, Mom's detail is not going
to like that.

1226
01:18:53,124 --> 01:18:55,866
Well, if Mom's detail
gets in the way

1227
01:18:55,866 --> 01:18:56,998
of what's coming for us,

1228
01:18:56,998 --> 01:18:58,564
they're dead men
and so are we.

1229
01:19:00,218 --> 01:19:02,003
Tell them they can
stay in the kitchen.

1230
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:02,960
Yes, sir.

1231
01:19:07,617 --> 01:19:09,793
He has a little talent,
doesn't he?

1232
01:19:09,793 --> 01:19:11,273
He's absolutely
fucking terrifying.

1233
01:19:11,273 --> 01:19:12,753
Yeah.

1234
01:19:12,753 --> 01:19:14,319
Good men,
but clearly not good enough.

1235
01:19:14,885 --> 01:19:16,800
Hm.
- Fuck, bruh!

1236
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,802
How'd you piss this oak off, huh?

1237
01:19:18,802 --> 01:19:20,195
I...

1238
01:19:20,195 --> 01:19:21,936
- You're looking at me?
Mm-hmm.

1239
01:19:21,936 --> 01:19:23,589
How is any of this my fault?

1240
01:19:24,199 --> 01:19:26,157
Wasn't your supersecret CIA

1241
01:19:26,157 --> 01:19:27,768
data mining software
supposed to,

1242
01:19:27,768 --> 01:19:29,030
I don't know, maybe filter out

1243
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:30,771
un-fucking-stoppable
killing machines?

1244
01:19:30,771 --> 01:19:32,250
Don't you fuck with me,
young man!

1245
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:34,035
Any other life,
you'd be in jail.

1246
01:19:34,035 --> 01:19:36,559
Hey, this is the fucking
Beekeeper!

1247
01:19:40,171 --> 01:19:42,173
Yeah, you know
I killed one once.

1248
01:19:42,173 --> 01:19:43,479
Oh, you see?

1249
01:19:43,479 --> 01:19:45,698
Yeah. Only 'cause I was lucky.

1250
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:48,310
- And un-fucking-lucky.
Oh, jeez.

1251
01:19:51,139 --> 01:19:53,271
Yeah, don't piss your pants, bruh.

1252
01:19:53,271 --> 01:19:54,664
My team will be out shortly.

1253
01:19:55,099 --> 01:19:56,448
If anyone can knock

1254
01:19:56,448 --> 01:19:58,276
this guy's dick in the dirt,
it's them.

1255
01:19:58,276 --> 01:20:00,801
Ain't that right, money man?

1256
01:20:02,890 --> 01:20:04,369
Yeah.

1257
01:20:19,994 --> 01:20:21,734
I'm supposed to be
at a kids' birthday party

1258
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:22,735
with my wife.

1259
01:20:26,783 --> 01:20:28,654
You are at a kids'
birthday party.

1260
01:20:28,654 --> 01:20:29,917
And I'm your work wife.

1261
01:20:45,062 --> 01:20:47,717
Madam President,
you look spectacular.

1262
01:20:47,717 --> 01:20:49,240
When the fuck are you
going to tell me

1263
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:50,676
what's going on, Wallace?

1264
01:20:54,332 --> 01:20:55,812
Good. Go through.

1265
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:58,989
Tell that guy
to hurry up.

1266
01:20:58,989 --> 01:21:01,818
I want every manhole
on this street welded shut.

1267
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:11,915
Six up.

1268
01:21:12,829 --> 01:21:13,874
Good to go.

1269
01:21:15,179 --> 01:21:16,485
Let's go. Let's go.

1270
01:21:28,584 --> 01:21:30,325
Come on. Move it up.

1271
01:21:47,211 --> 01:21:49,126
Put your head
on a swivel, gentlemen.

1272
01:22:05,534 --> 01:22:06,535
Go!

1273
01:22:34,171 --> 01:22:36,391
We got eyes
on the second floor.

1274
01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:45,791
All right, you're good.
Coming through.

1275
01:23:09,554 --> 01:23:11,034
Oh.

1276
01:23:11,034 --> 01:23:14,429
Hey. When, uh, did you get in?
What a surprise.

1277
01:23:16,039 --> 01:23:18,520
You didn't hear
the giant Marine helicopter

1278
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:19,912
land on the front lawn?

1279
01:23:20,565 --> 01:23:22,524
Ah, I guess not. Hm.

1280
01:23:22,524 --> 01:23:24,743
Is this, uh, nicotine
or a carnival ride?

1281
01:23:24,743 --> 01:23:27,355
Uh, I wouldn't unless
you want to go

1282
01:23:27,355 --> 01:23:28,486
talk with the machine elves.

1283
01:23:32,925 --> 01:23:34,971
Hey, you look fucking great,
by the way.

1284
01:23:34,971 --> 01:23:37,800
I mean,  power,
it just looks so good on you.

1285
01:23:38,279 --> 01:23:40,585
Doing blow
on your father's desk.

1286
01:23:40,585 --> 01:23:42,370
God, how I wish
he was still alive

1287
01:23:42,370 --> 01:23:44,154
- so I could kill him.

1288
01:23:46,374 --> 01:23:48,245
Stop picking your face.

1289
01:23:51,161 --> 01:23:53,946
Why does Wallace Westwyld
look nervous as a burning cat?

1290
01:23:53,946 --> 01:23:55,252
What have you done to the man?

1291
01:23:56,079 --> 01:23:58,038
Mm, I wouldn't know, Mother.

1292
01:23:58,995 --> 01:24:00,431
Well, he's there
to protect you

1293
01:24:00,431 --> 01:24:01,432
if you'll let him.

1294
01:24:05,088 --> 01:24:07,786
You're a good looking kid.
You really are. You know that?

1295
01:24:09,353 --> 01:24:10,354
What does that mean?

1296
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:16,186
It means that God doesn't give
with both  hands.

1297
01:24:16,186 --> 01:24:18,449
Uh, okay.
I love you too, Mom.

1298
01:24:18,449 --> 01:24:20,060
Hm.

1299
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:21,626
Gotta go run the free world.

1300
01:24:22,410 --> 01:24:23,541
Don't burn it down.

1301
01:24:30,505 --> 01:24:32,115
Fucking fantastic!

1302
01:25:39,617 --> 01:25:40,792
Wiley, look.

1303
01:25:42,229 --> 01:25:44,100
Oh, shit.

1304
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:45,797
Danforth looks like
she wants to throw up.

1305
01:25:46,363 --> 01:25:48,626
Look at her body language.
Bad vibes.

1306
01:25:50,019 --> 01:25:51,368
She got caught riding dirty.

1307
01:25:52,804 --> 01:25:54,110
What have we done?

1308
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:57,200
Are you, uh, fucking
with crypto at all, right now?

1309
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:58,375
It's gonna pop.

1310
01:25:58,810 --> 01:26:01,073
They're minting next week,
so just hit me up on Insta.

1311
01:26:01,073 --> 01:26:02,858
- Okay.
- I'll connect your wallet.

1312
01:26:02,858 --> 01:26:04,642
- May I borrow my son?
- Of course.

1313
01:26:04,642 --> 01:26:06,122
Speak to you a moment
in private?

1314
01:26:08,342 --> 01:26:09,256
Sorry.

1315
01:26:12,433 --> 01:26:13,912
Uh, who's this?

1316
01:26:13,912 --> 01:26:15,871
Jackson Prigg.
He's number two at the FBI.

1317
01:26:15,871 --> 01:26:17,220
Have a seat.

1318
01:26:17,220 --> 01:26:18,917
Uh, I'm cool. I'll stand.
What is this, like,

1319
01:26:18,917 --> 01:26:20,789
an ambush or something?
This feels weird.
I don't like it.

1320
01:26:20,789 --> 01:26:22,094
No, you'll sit.

1321
01:26:25,359 --> 01:26:26,534
I'll sit.

1322
01:26:30,364 --> 01:26:31,582
Kelly, would you
give us a moment?

1323
01:26:31,582 --> 01:26:33,193
It's okay, ma'am.
I can take notes.

1324
01:26:33,193 --> 01:26:34,672
I need you to step outside.

1325
01:26:43,203 --> 01:26:46,206
The deputy director
has flagged his, uh, concerns

1326
01:26:46,206 --> 01:26:47,685
about some
uncomfortable things

1327
01:26:47,685 --> 01:26:49,209
happening inside
the family company.

1328
01:26:49,861 --> 01:26:51,689
Like what?

1329
01:26:51,689 --> 01:26:52,734
Uncomfortable things about

1330
01:26:52,734 --> 01:26:54,257
the source
of my campaign funds.

1331
01:26:55,737 --> 01:26:57,565
Sounds serious. What's up?

1332
01:26:58,783 --> 01:27:00,132
Deputy Director.

1333
01:27:00,611 --> 01:27:04,441
Mr. Danforth, are you familiar
with, uh, United Data Group?

1334
01:27:05,834 --> 01:27:07,705
United Data Group.

1335
01:27:08,358 --> 01:27:11,056
Yeah. Yeah, I, uh...

1336
01:27:11,056 --> 01:27:13,102
I invested in that.

1337
01:27:13,755 --> 01:27:14,973
I invest everywhere.

1338
01:27:14,973 --> 01:27:16,497
I mean, there's...
It's everywhere.

1339
01:27:16,497 --> 01:27:18,325
- It's very diverse.
- Uh-huh.

1340
01:27:18,325 --> 01:27:21,197
How about, uh,
Nine Star United?

1341
01:27:24,287 --> 01:27:25,810
Yeah, that was, uh...

1342
01:27:25,810 --> 01:27:28,335
that's more of, like,
a consulting type role.

1343
01:27:28,335 --> 01:27:30,554
It's block chain issues.
And you probably...

1344
01:27:30,554 --> 01:27:33,165
I don't want to bore you
with all that.

1345
01:27:34,602 --> 01:27:38,083
What do you know
about a classified algorithmic

1346
01:27:38,083 --> 01:27:39,563
data mining software package

1347
01:27:39,563 --> 01:27:42,000
developed by
the intelligence community?

1348
01:27:55,927 --> 01:27:57,233
He's here.

1349
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:00,105
All stations, target's
in the building. East wing.

1350
01:28:00,105 --> 01:28:01,629
<i>Give me everything you got.</i>

1351
01:28:01,629 --> 01:28:02,717
He's in the house!

1352
01:28:03,370 --> 01:28:05,328
Assault team, saddle up!

1353
01:28:05,328 --> 01:28:06,808
Let's move, boys!
Get a move on!

1354
01:28:06,808 --> 01:28:08,331
Let's move! Come on!

1355
01:28:08,331 --> 01:28:10,551
- Go! Come on. Move!
- Go! Go!

1356
01:28:11,813 --> 01:28:13,728
Break-break!
Package is in the house!

1357
01:28:13,728 --> 01:28:15,556
Level three, side four.

1358
01:28:15,556 --> 01:28:18,341
Blue over blue, you see him,
you fucking get him!

1359
01:28:18,950 --> 01:28:21,475
Hey!
Put your fucking hands up.

1360
01:28:23,433 --> 01:28:25,217
Now turn the fuck around.

1361
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:31,485
- Fuck.
Fuck.

1362
01:28:34,357 --> 01:28:35,793
He's outside.
Target's outside.

1363
01:28:35,793 --> 01:28:37,317
Move! Move!

1364
01:28:37,317 --> 01:28:39,014
Let's get this fucking guy!

1365
01:28:39,014 --> 01:28:40,668
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, killer. You see him?

1366
01:28:40,668 --> 01:28:43,061
- Negative.

1367
01:28:43,061 --> 01:28:44,454
- Clay!
- That's right.

1368
01:28:46,587 --> 01:28:49,459
That's right.
Now, on your knees!

1369
01:28:49,459 --> 01:28:51,200
On your knees!

1370
01:28:52,288 --> 01:28:54,508
Lace your fingers
behind your head.

1371
01:28:56,597 --> 01:29:00,818
Down on your knees now!

1372
01:29:00,818 --> 01:29:02,124
Do it now!

1373
01:29:07,608 --> 01:29:10,959
Beekeeper, huh?
God's right hand?

1374
01:29:11,481 --> 01:29:12,613
You aren't shit.

1375
01:29:12,613 --> 01:29:13,788
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1376
01:29:13,788 --> 01:29:14,963
Hey,
take a step back.

1377
01:29:15,659 --> 01:29:17,618
I'm putting this asshole's
brains on the lawn.

1378
01:29:17,618 --> 01:29:19,489
What are you doing?
He's not even armed.

1379
01:29:19,489 --> 01:29:21,622
Armed?

1380
01:29:21,622 --> 01:29:23,580
As long as this motherfucker's
breathing, he's armed.

1381
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:25,800
You're not fucking
executing him.

1382
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:27,976
Nice crowd
you're rolling with.

1383
01:29:35,592 --> 01:29:36,767
Watch me.

1384
01:29:37,899 --> 01:29:39,248
V, what the fuck is going on?

1385
01:29:39,857 --> 01:29:42,033
To "bee" or not to "bee"?

1386
01:29:42,425 --> 01:29:44,514
Isn't that
the bloody question?

1387
01:29:45,515 --> 01:29:46,734
I think I'll take

1388
01:29:47,735 --> 01:29:49,171
- to "bee."

1389
01:29:59,442 --> 01:30:01,183
- Wiley?
- Yeah, you good?

1390
01:30:01,183 --> 01:30:02,227
- Yeah.
- Go.

1391
01:30:04,752 --> 01:30:06,449
Get off me!

1392
01:30:07,842 --> 01:30:09,321
He's fucking mine!

1393
01:30:10,235 --> 01:30:12,063
Talk to me, people.
I need news.

1394
01:30:21,377 --> 01:30:22,552
He's here!

1395
01:30:22,552 --> 01:30:24,380
Go! Go! All stations!

1396
01:30:27,296 --> 01:30:29,472
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1397
01:30:33,955 --> 01:30:35,173
Go with the flow.

1398
01:30:35,173 --> 01:30:36,653
Not clear.
He's not clear.

1399
01:30:36,653 --> 01:30:37,915
Hang tight.

1400
01:30:37,915 --> 01:30:39,134
On me.

1401
01:30:59,067 --> 01:31:01,243
Get on the ground.
Get on the ground.

1402
01:31:04,028 --> 01:31:06,466
You understand you did this, right?

1403
01:31:06,466 --> 01:31:07,815
You broke the rules.

1404
01:31:08,337 --> 01:31:10,165
You corrupted an imperfect
but functioning system.

1405
01:31:10,165 --> 01:31:12,254
I was just trying
to get you into office, Mom.

1406
01:31:12,254 --> 01:31:13,777
How else do you think
you got elected?

1407
01:31:13,777 --> 01:31:15,475
I was going to win
with or without your help.

1408
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:19,348
We were already rich.
Your father built an empire.

1409
01:31:19,348 --> 01:31:20,958
Yeah. And you were going
to fucking

1410
01:31:20,958 --> 01:31:22,830
break it up into pieces
and sell it off.

1411
01:31:22,830 --> 01:31:24,309
Well, in the name
of public service

1412
01:31:24,309 --> 01:31:26,964
because I care and I want
to leave a better world.

1413
01:31:26,964 --> 01:31:28,139
Okay. Right.

1414
01:31:28,139 --> 01:31:29,880
Yeah, because
you hate the fact

1415
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:31,273
that being the president

1416
01:31:31,273 --> 01:31:32,796
is just like
an endless cocktail party.

1417
01:31:32,796 --> 01:31:34,189
You realize
that you were behind

1418
01:31:34,189 --> 01:31:35,973
in 15 of 20 counties
you needed to win.

1419
01:31:35,973 --> 01:31:37,627
15 of 20 counties!

1420
01:31:37,627 --> 01:31:40,630
I taught CIA software
to hunt money

1421
01:31:40,630 --> 01:31:41,892
and not terrorists.

1422
01:31:43,503 --> 01:31:44,808
You didn't hear that.

1423
01:31:58,343 --> 01:32:00,302
You got elected because of me,
and you know that.

1424
01:32:00,302 --> 01:32:02,696
Yeah, I know it.
Everyone knows it.

1425
01:32:02,696 --> 01:32:04,132
Now I know
where the money came from...

1426
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:06,613
...and all the people
you hurt.

1427
01:32:06,613 --> 01:32:08,528
Okay, whatever.
It's computer data, Mom.

1428
01:32:08,528 --> 01:32:10,530
Somebody in this family has
to have their fucking feet

1429
01:32:10,530 --> 01:32:12,575
on the ground to actually get
shit done. You understand that?

1430
01:32:28,591 --> 01:32:32,552
Mom, the wolves are
at the fucking door right now.

1431
01:32:33,117 --> 01:32:34,597
What are you going to do
to fix this?

1432
01:32:38,383 --> 01:32:39,428
Tell the truth.

1433
01:32:41,517 --> 01:32:42,823
The fucking...

1434
01:32:42,823 --> 01:32:44,651
What does that even mean?

1435
01:32:44,651 --> 01:32:46,696
What does that even mean,
tell the fucking truth?

1436
01:32:46,696 --> 01:32:47,958
- You have an entire building

1437
01:32:47,958 --> 01:32:49,438
full of PR people

1438
01:32:49,438 --> 01:32:51,309
that are going to choose
the right way forward.

1439
01:32:51,309 --> 01:32:53,181
That guy who's coming
to kill us, that Beekeeper,

1440
01:32:53,181 --> 01:32:56,053
I'm telling him the truth
about what you did, Derek.

1441
01:32:56,053 --> 01:32:57,751
Then I'm telling
the entire nation.

1442
01:32:57,751 --> 01:32:59,622
And if it costs me everything,

1443
01:33:00,014 --> 01:33:01,493
well, so be it.

1444
01:34:15,089 --> 01:34:16,394
You fucking git!

1445
01:34:22,618 --> 01:34:23,619
Fuck!

1446
01:34:28,668 --> 01:34:30,147
You're just a man.

1447
01:34:30,713 --> 01:34:32,062
I know.

1448
01:35:25,115 --> 01:35:27,248
- Thank you.

1449
01:36:02,457 --> 01:36:04,807
Jesus. Looks like
a tornado came through here.

1450
01:36:10,682 --> 01:36:12,075
What's your plan here, huh?

1451
01:36:12,075 --> 01:36:13,598
You're going to tell this guy
the fucking truth

1452
01:36:13,598 --> 01:36:15,339
and hope that he spares you
and kills me instead?

1453
01:36:15,339 --> 01:36:16,601
No, Derek,
I'll tell him the truth

1454
01:36:16,601 --> 01:36:17,733
because it's the truth.

1455
01:36:27,874 --> 01:36:30,006
It's gone far enough.
You've proved your point.

1456
01:36:31,094 --> 01:36:33,314
Beekeepers live
for the good of society.

1457
01:36:34,968 --> 01:36:36,099
I'm retired.

1458
01:36:37,405 --> 01:36:38,667
This is personal.

1459
01:36:39,799 --> 01:36:41,191
All the more reason to stop.

1460
01:36:42,932 --> 01:36:45,195
Go back. Live a quiet life.

1461
01:36:45,935 --> 01:36:47,589
Making honey
for your neighbors.

1462
01:36:48,068 --> 01:36:49,286
That's all I wanted.

1463
01:36:50,505 --> 01:36:53,334
- My neighbor's dead.
- I know. I'm sorry.

1464
01:36:53,334 --> 01:36:55,858
But do you live
in the real world

1465
01:36:55,858 --> 01:36:57,512
or just protect it?

1466
01:37:00,907 --> 01:37:02,212
What does it matter to you

1467
01:37:02,212 --> 01:37:04,867
how presidents
come to be elected?

1468
01:37:04,867 --> 01:37:07,087
- Hm?
- It doesn't.

1469
01:37:07,696 --> 01:37:09,263
What does matter to you?

1470
01:37:10,133 --> 01:37:11,178
Right and wrong.

1471
01:37:12,353 --> 01:37:13,571
It's not fashionable.

1472
01:37:14,834 --> 01:37:16,400
I believe there's good
in the universe.

1473
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:20,578
Yeah, well, we agree.
I mean, that's my view.

1474
01:37:21,841 --> 01:37:23,843
Until the Danforth family
bought you.

1475
01:37:24,408 --> 01:37:26,236
- Ah.
- You can stop pretending.

1476
01:37:27,585 --> 01:37:30,023
We wouldn't need Beekeepers
if it wasn't for men like you.

1477
01:37:30,632 --> 01:37:32,112
Don't do that.

1478
01:37:32,112 --> 01:37:33,330
Sir, you might want
to step back.

1479
01:37:33,330 --> 01:37:34,636
No.

1480
01:37:35,071 --> 01:37:37,247
- I don't want you to get hurt.
- I'm sorry. I can't do that.

1481
01:37:38,945 --> 01:37:40,076
Now, have a seat.

1482
01:37:44,298 --> 01:37:47,562
Nah, fuck the truth, man.
The truth...

1483
01:37:47,562 --> 01:37:48,911
- Wait. You put that down.
- No, Derek.

1484
01:37:48,911 --> 01:37:50,260
...comes out
of your fucking...

1485
01:37:51,609 --> 01:37:52,872
Jesus Christ!

1486
01:37:52,872 --> 01:37:54,047
That's fucking real
right there.

1487
01:38:07,190 --> 01:38:08,583
- Clay, no!
- Drop your weapon. Drop it!

1488
01:38:25,513 --> 01:38:27,210
You decide who you work for.

1489
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:30,648
For the law

1490
01:38:32,433 --> 01:38:33,913
or for justice.

1491
01:38:37,090 --> 01:38:38,178
Fuck this.

1492
01:38:38,613 --> 01:38:39,483
Bye, Mom.

1493
01:38:46,186 --> 01:38:48,014
Go! Go!
Move. Move.

1494
01:38:48,014 --> 01:38:49,841
- Move it out. Out of the way.
You're okay.

1495
01:38:49,841 --> 01:38:52,888
- I got you. I got you.
- No. No. I want my...

1496
01:38:54,368 --> 01:38:55,412
Clay!

1497
01:38:58,894 --> 01:39:00,026
Come with us right now!

1498
01:39:01,070 --> 01:39:04,204
- No! I want my... I want my...
- Back away. Back away.

1499
01:39:04,204 --> 01:39:05,727
No!

1500
01:39:05,727 --> 01:39:07,381
You need to come
with me. Come on.

1501
01:39:07,381 --> 01:39:09,078
- No!
- Move out. Move out.

1502
01:39:10,166 --> 01:39:12,386
- Give me your hand. Come on!
No!

1503
01:39:25,355 --> 01:39:26,835
Goodbye, Adam Clay.

1504
01:39:27,662 --> 01:39:29,969
- Keep eyes on! Let's go!
