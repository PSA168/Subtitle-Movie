1
00:01:16,279 --> 00:01:18,648
-You're late, Jacques.
-Sorry, Father.

2
00:01:18,682 --> 00:01:19,949
Go fetch the wine.

3
00:01:19,983 --> 00:01:20,884
Why don't

4
00:01:20,917 --> 00:01:22,252
you go fetch the wine?

5
00:01:22,285 --> 00:01:23,920
-Pardon?
-Er, nothing.

6
00:01:50,814 --> 00:01:53,349
Let your spirit
come upon these gifts

7
00:01:53,383 --> 00:01:57,287
to make them holy
so that they may become for us,

8
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,991
the body and blood of our Lord,
Jesus Christ.

9
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,264
Body of Christ.

10
00:02:08,298 --> 00:02:09,332
Amen.

11
00:02:12,402 --> 00:02:14,004
-The blood of Christ.
-Amen.

12
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:25,735
-Father.
-Yes?

13
00:04:25,768 --> 00:04:27,503
-There's someone here.
-Where?

14
00:05:02,206 --> 00:05:03,907
Who's there?

15
00:05:05,475 --> 00:05:09,445
Whoever you are,
whatever you are here for,

16
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:10,580
you are in a house of God.

17
00:05:12,482 --> 00:05:13,583
And He's watching you.

18
00:07:05,628 --> 00:07:07,131
Get this under the other tire.

19
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:39,329
Sister Irene!
Sister Irene!

20
00:07:41,664 --> 00:07:42,632
Sister Debra.

21
00:07:42,665 --> 00:07:44,634
It's Sister Debra.

22
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:45,735
<i>She's trouble.</i>

23
00:07:45,768 --> 00:07:48,604
Every day she's making trouble.

24
00:07:48,638 --> 00:07:51,275
And now, she refused
to go to confession.

25
00:07:54,044 --> 00:07:55,778
And you know why?

26
00:07:55,812 --> 00:07:59,949
She did not think
she had anything to confess.

27
00:07:59,982 --> 00:08:02,985
For that alone,
she should be confessing.

28
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,787
I will have a talk with her,
Reverend Mother.

29
00:08:04,821 --> 00:08:06,090
<i>Grazie,</i> Sister.

30
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:18,135
Sister Debra?

31
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:20,670
Sister Irene.

32
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:23,773
This about confession?

33
00:08:23,806 --> 00:08:25,309
You're going to give the Mother
a heart attack.

34
00:08:25,342 --> 00:08:27,677
Well, then maybe
I'll have something to confess.

35
00:08:38,122 --> 00:08:39,622
Your father
sent you here, right?

36
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,727
Yes. I was different.

37
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,265
Sending me away was easier than
trying to understand who I was.

38
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:51,767
What'd your mama
say about that?

39
00:08:57,974 --> 00:08:59,309
I barely remember her.

40
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:03,280
But my father always said
I was just like her.

41
00:09:05,781 --> 00:09:07,317
I don't think he meant it
as a compliment.

42
00:09:11,754 --> 00:09:15,858
Well, my family's
from Mississippi,

43
00:09:15,892 --> 00:09:18,328
but we ran into some trouble
down there.

44
00:09:18,362 --> 00:09:21,731
When I was four, white folks,
they found where we were,

45
00:09:21,764 --> 00:09:22,965
burned our house down.

46
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,005
After that,
my brothers joined the army.

47
00:09:28,038 --> 00:09:31,175
My dad figured,
"My boys can serve country,

48
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,410
my daughter can serve God."

49
00:09:34,977 --> 00:09:36,480
Never in my wildest dreams
did I think

50
00:09:36,513 --> 00:09:38,248
I was gonna end up here.

51
00:09:41,951 --> 00:09:43,819
Do I still have
to go to confession?

52
00:09:46,223 --> 00:09:47,790
I think
you've confessed enough.

53
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:50,960
One by one,

54
00:09:50,993 --> 00:09:54,264
the sisters
found themselves murdered.

55
00:09:54,298 --> 00:09:59,069
Hanging from windows.
Throat slit open.

56
00:09:59,102 --> 00:10:01,138
Acts of suicide.

57
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:03,739
Sometimes worse.

58
00:10:03,773 --> 00:10:06,909
They learned
that beneath their remote abbey

59
00:10:06,943 --> 00:10:10,047
was a terrible secret.

60
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,915
A gateway to hell.

61
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:17,987
And from this gateway,
a demon had escaped.

62
00:10:20,023 --> 00:10:23,327
Now, we know that a demon
can take any form,

63
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,763
but they choose their form
to challenge your faith

64
00:10:27,797 --> 00:10:29,832
and to weaken your spirits.

65
00:10:31,801 --> 00:10:36,039
Now, for the nuns
of Saint Carta,

66
00:10:36,073 --> 00:10:40,244
this demon
chose the most ungodly,

67
00:10:40,277 --> 00:10:44,014
the most blasphemous form.

68
00:10:44,047 --> 00:10:47,517
It chose
to look like one of them.

69
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:51,221
And then what happened?

70
00:10:51,255 --> 00:10:54,924
Well, the Vatican sent in
a pair of demon hunters.

71
00:10:54,957 --> 00:10:59,229
A priest and a nun.

72
00:10:59,263 --> 00:11:02,132
-And how did they stop it?
-Great question.

73
00:11:02,165 --> 00:11:04,967
They used an ancient relic,

74
00:11:05,002 --> 00:11:11,807
a vial which contained
the blood of Jesus Christ.

75
00:11:11,841 --> 00:11:16,013
So, they returned as heroes,
kissed the Pope's ring.

76
00:11:16,046 --> 00:11:18,814
Priest was made a bishop.

77
00:11:18,848 --> 00:11:21,151
What happened to the nun?

78
00:11:21,184 --> 00:11:23,520
Well, no one really knows.

79
00:11:23,553 --> 00:11:26,356
They say the experience
was too much for her.

80
00:11:27,391 --> 00:11:30,926
Some say that she went mad.

81
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,531
The Vatican had to lock her up
in an asylum.

82
00:11:49,446 --> 00:11:52,249
Gotcha! Quick!

83
00:11:52,282 --> 00:11:54,184
Why does Madame
have so much wine?

84
00:11:54,217 --> 00:11:55,419
This used
to be a monastery.

85
00:11:55,452 --> 00:11:57,220
The monks were all fat drunks.

86
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:19,509
Everyone downstairs, please.
It's nearly eight o'clock.

87
00:12:19,543 --> 00:12:20,610
Come on, now.

88
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:27,284
I got 'em.

89
00:12:29,252 --> 00:12:30,520
Took you long enough.

90
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,014
Hail Mary, full of grace,

91
00:12:58,048 --> 00:12:59,082
the Lord is with thee.

92
00:12:59,116 --> 00:13:00,584
Blessed art thou among women,

93
00:13:00,617 --> 00:13:04,054
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

94
00:13:04,087 --> 00:13:07,290
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners now

95
00:13:07,324 --> 00:13:09,159
and at the hour
of our--

96
00:13:09,192 --> 00:13:10,460
Jesus Christ!

97
00:13:10,494 --> 00:13:11,495
Bloody hell!

98
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,148
Kate.

99
00:13:32,982 --> 00:13:35,519
-Good morning.
-Hard at work already?

100
00:13:35,552 --> 00:13:36,586
Always.

101
00:13:39,489 --> 00:13:40,524
Good morning, Maurice.

102
00:13:42,025 --> 00:13:42,992
Captain!

103
00:13:45,362 --> 00:13:46,630
Come on now, Sophie.

104
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:51,735
-Hi, Maurice.
-Morning.

105
00:13:51,768 --> 00:13:54,171
-Morning, Maurice.
-Ladies.

106
00:13:54,204 --> 00:13:56,640
Hey, Maurice, do you wanna play
baseball with us today?

107
00:13:56,673 --> 00:13:58,475
Course, I do. You know what?

108
00:13:58,508 --> 00:14:02,345
I'll teach you how
to throw a knuckleball.

109
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:04,681
-Maurice. Maurice.
-Oh. Captain Sophie.

110
00:14:04,714 --> 00:14:06,683
Lieutenant.

111
00:14:06,716 --> 00:14:09,686
I made this for you.
It's a friendship bracelet.

112
00:14:09,719 --> 00:14:11,154
Each bead represents

113
00:14:11,188 --> 00:14:12,489
a different quality
of a good friend.

114
00:14:12,522 --> 00:14:14,357
Wow. It's beautiful, Sophie.
Thank you.

115
00:14:14,391 --> 00:14:17,327
Woo-hoo! Woo! Woo!

116
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,230
Are you proposing to
your boyfriend, little Sophie?

117
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:25,769
-Give it back.
-You can't make me.

118
00:14:25,802 --> 00:14:28,371
You're not a teacher.
You're the servant.

119
00:14:38,482 --> 00:14:40,150
Even the servant knows

120
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:43,587
you should treat everyone
with kindness and respect.

121
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,558
-Girls.
-Oui, Madame.

122
00:14:48,592 --> 00:14:54,197
What do you think you're doing?
This is not a playground!

123
00:14:54,231 --> 00:14:56,233
-Get to class!
-<i>Oui,</i> Madame.

124
00:14:56,266 --> 00:14:59,236
-And you, Maurice.
-Mm?

125
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:01,738
There was a cockroach
in my quarters again.

126
00:15:01,771 --> 00:15:03,173
Ah, that's unfortunate.

127
00:15:03,206 --> 00:15:05,509
It's an infestation.
It's disgusting.

128
00:15:05,542 --> 00:15:08,345
I'll tend to it right away.

129
00:15:08,378 --> 00:15:10,280
-You'd better.
-I promise.

130
00:15:12,315 --> 00:15:14,751
Captain! Captain! Wait.

131
00:15:25,462 --> 00:15:26,630
How did you do that?

132
00:15:26,663 --> 00:15:28,365
Skills I learned
from another life.

133
00:15:29,432 --> 00:15:31,401
How do I look?

134
00:15:31,434 --> 00:15:33,136
Come on, get to class. Come on.

135
00:16:16,546 --> 00:16:18,848
<i>Bonjour.</i> Delivery.

136
00:18:02,986 --> 00:18:04,688
<i>Monsieur?</i>

137
00:18:08,692 --> 00:18:10,193
Are you okay?

138
00:19:22,465 --> 00:19:23,900
Sister.

139
00:19:26,003 --> 00:19:27,737
You have a visitor.

140
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,331
Reverend Mother?

141
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,624
Maurice?

142
00:20:26,096 --> 00:20:27,497
Save me, Sister.

143
00:20:29,532 --> 00:20:32,069
Irene! It's okay. It's okay.

144
00:20:32,102 --> 00:20:33,903
You're fine. You're fine.

145
00:20:34,704 --> 00:20:35,705
Your nose.

146
00:20:56,492 --> 00:20:57,961
Sister Irene.

147
00:20:59,163 --> 00:21:00,697
You have a visitor.

148
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,625
Sister Irene.

149
00:21:28,658 --> 00:21:29,959
Your Eminence.

150
00:21:31,628 --> 00:21:33,463
There has been an incident.

151
00:21:34,464 --> 00:21:36,733
A series of them.

152
00:21:36,766 --> 00:21:40,470
Szeleste, a small village
in Hungary.

153
00:21:40,503 --> 00:21:43,973
A 90-year-old nun shot herself
on the steps of her church.

154
00:21:44,008 --> 00:21:46,043
Graz, Austria.

155
00:21:46,076 --> 00:21:48,212
A priest cut his throat open
with a rosary

156
00:21:48,245 --> 00:21:50,014
during Christmas mass.

157
00:21:50,047 --> 00:21:51,514
Edolo, Italy.

158
00:21:51,547 --> 00:21:54,717
A novitiate threw herself
out a window.

159
00:21:54,751 --> 00:21:56,920
Sound familiar?

160
00:21:56,953 --> 00:21:59,656
Just a month ago,
in Tarascon, France,

161
00:21:59,689 --> 00:22:02,126
another priest,
murdered inside his church.

162
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,927
Immolated.

163
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,864
Notice a pattern?
It's moving west across Europe.

164
00:22:07,897 --> 00:22:10,067
But its origins point
to Romania.

165
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,836
-It can't be.
-The demon lives.

166
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,139
Have you spoken
with Father Burke?

167
00:22:15,172 --> 00:22:16,739
Father Burke is dead.

168
00:22:18,508 --> 00:22:20,977
-How?
-Cholera.

169
00:22:21,011 --> 00:22:22,645
You are
the only person alive

170
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:24,580
who has dealt
with something like this.

171
00:22:24,614 --> 00:22:27,750
The Church would like
<i>you</i> to investigate.

172
00:22:27,784 --> 00:22:31,921
Find out what it wants
and where it's going next.

173
00:22:32,889 --> 00:22:33,790
No.

174
00:22:35,591 --> 00:22:37,194
I'm sorry?

175
00:22:37,227 --> 00:22:39,629
I said, "No."

176
00:22:39,662 --> 00:22:41,798
-I can't do it.
-Can't, or won't?

177
00:22:41,831 --> 00:22:44,834
You don't know what happened
at Saint Carta.

178
00:22:44,867 --> 00:22:46,602
I was lucky
to make it out alive.

179
00:22:46,636 --> 00:22:49,605
You're right. I don't know
what you faced back there.

180
00:22:49,639 --> 00:22:53,776
But in that abbey, Sister,
you performed a miracle.

181
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,745
The Church needs another.

182
00:23:15,732 --> 00:23:17,234
-Here you are.
-Sister?

183
00:23:17,267 --> 00:23:19,569
Was afraid I almost hopped
on the wrong train.

184
00:23:19,602 --> 00:23:21,005
What are you doing here?

185
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:22,839
Looking after you.

186
00:23:22,872 --> 00:23:25,109
-Someone's gotta.
-Sister, you could be expelled.

187
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,177
Why are you here?

188
00:23:35,918 --> 00:23:36,886
My mama.

189
00:23:38,322 --> 00:23:40,224
She died in the fire.

190
00:23:40,257 --> 00:23:41,891
She was my church.

191
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,929
I want to believe in miracles.

192
00:23:46,963 --> 00:23:48,664
But when I see
the priest stand up

193
00:23:48,698 --> 00:23:51,235
and say he turned the wine
into the blood of Christ,

194
00:23:51,268 --> 00:23:53,736
I mean,
it's kind of hard to believe.

195
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,139
It's an act of faith.

196
00:23:55,172 --> 00:23:57,573
He just says a bunch
of words to wine.

197
00:23:57,607 --> 00:24:01,778
The wine becomes the blood
of Christ because we believe.

198
00:24:01,811 --> 00:24:03,646
The most extraordinary
parts of our faith

199
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,815
are only real
because we believe in them.

200
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:08,951
I guess so.

201
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,888
You're not ready.

202
00:24:12,655 --> 00:24:14,124
Why?

203
00:24:14,158 --> 00:24:17,194
An entire convent of nuns died
facing this thing.

204
00:24:17,227 --> 00:24:20,130
Women who dedicated
their lives to their faith.

205
00:24:20,164 --> 00:24:21,764
Then sacrificed their lives

206
00:24:21,798 --> 00:24:23,033
because they believed
in something greater.

207
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:25,835
You need me.

208
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:32,276
I just hope you can find
your faith when the time comes.

209
00:24:48,325 --> 00:24:50,760
"Why, get you gone.
Who is't that hinders you?"

210
00:24:50,793 --> 00:24:52,795
"A foolish heart
that I leave here behind."

211
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:54,331
"What, with Lysander?"

212
00:24:54,364 --> 00:24:56,066
"With Demetrius."

213
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,036
"Be not afraid. She shall not
harm thee, Helena."

214
00:24:59,069 --> 00:25:02,772
"No, sir, she shall not,
though you take her part."

215
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:06,876
"O, when she is angry,
she is keen and shrewd.

216
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:09,213
She was a vixen
when she went to school.

217
00:25:09,246 --> 00:25:12,648
And though she be but little,
she is fierce."

218
00:25:12,682 --> 00:25:14,251
"Little again!

219
00:25:14,284 --> 00:25:18,255
Nothing but low and little!
Why will you suffer her--"

220
00:25:18,288 --> 00:25:21,024
Uh, let's take a break.
Fifteen minutes.

221
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:23,093
I was just getting
into character.

222
00:25:23,127 --> 00:25:26,029
Yeah,
an awful character.

223
00:25:26,063 --> 00:25:27,897
All right, girls.
Slowly, now.

224
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,166
Girls.

225
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:31,168
Sweetheart,
take these to the office.

226
00:25:37,174 --> 00:25:38,242
You're the best.

227
00:25:42,312 --> 00:25:44,680
I heard there was
a faulty cabinet in the area?

228
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,018
The latch won't open.

229
00:25:48,051 --> 00:25:49,386
-May I?
-Oh, please.

230
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:58,061
Yeah. It's stuck.

231
00:25:58,095 --> 00:26:01,265
Can you just, please,
put a little pressure here?

232
00:26:01,298 --> 00:26:03,300
Yeah. Just here.

233
00:26:04,368 --> 00:26:05,968
All right. Thanks.

234
00:26:09,339 --> 00:26:11,375
Looks like we share
the latest fashion.

235
00:26:14,211 --> 00:26:15,179
I guess we do.

236
00:26:15,945 --> 00:26:16,979
Okay.

237
00:26:22,818 --> 00:26:23,853
Oh!

238
00:26:25,389 --> 00:26:26,889
Voila!

239
00:26:26,923 --> 00:26:28,292
Thanks a many.

240
00:26:28,325 --> 00:26:29,393
All right.

241
00:26:31,061 --> 00:26:32,162
Okay.

242
00:26:35,798 --> 00:26:39,203
She's a great kid.
You must be proud.

243
00:26:40,437 --> 00:26:41,704
I am.

244
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,225
Need some help?

245
00:27:03,093 --> 00:27:05,128
No, I'm okay.

246
00:27:05,162 --> 00:27:08,131
Relax, Sophie.
We're not going to do anything.

247
00:27:09,533 --> 00:27:10,733
Cross my heart.

248
00:27:13,303 --> 00:27:16,906
That was pretty mean
of us earlier.

249
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:19,042
I was a bitch.

250
00:27:22,246 --> 00:27:23,180
It's okay.

251
00:27:24,348 --> 00:27:26,183
What are you doing after this?

252
00:27:26,216 --> 00:27:28,185
We have to go back to class.

253
00:27:28,218 --> 00:27:30,153
Not for another ten minutes.

254
00:27:30,187 --> 00:27:31,954
Do you want to have some fun?

255
00:27:42,965 --> 00:27:45,435
Madame says
the chapel is off limits.

256
00:27:45,469 --> 00:27:46,503
I know.

257
00:28:59,909 --> 00:29:03,113
-What are we doing here?
-Playing a game.

258
00:29:03,146 --> 00:29:06,183
It's called "Defy the Devil."

259
00:29:08,051 --> 00:29:11,288
I don't see any devil.

260
00:29:12,489 --> 00:29:14,890
The devil is always here.

261
00:29:14,924 --> 00:29:17,294
You're just not looking
carefully enough.

262
00:29:21,064 --> 00:29:26,403
It depends on where you stand
and when you look.

263
00:29:28,305 --> 00:29:31,074
At the right time of day...

264
00:29:31,108 --> 00:29:36,213
the sun hits the glass
at just the right angle.

265
00:29:36,246 --> 00:29:38,615
And if you're watching
carefully,

266
00:29:38,648 --> 00:29:40,450
he looks right at you.

267
00:29:42,085 --> 00:29:45,122
The rumor is, if you look away,

268
00:29:45,155 --> 00:29:50,160
the devil will appear in
the form of a monstrous goat.

269
00:29:56,266 --> 00:29:59,002
See?
He's watching you.

270
00:30:01,271 --> 00:30:03,106
Whatever you do,

271
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,542
whatever you hear,

272
00:30:05,575 --> 00:30:07,477
don't look away.

273
00:31:17,747 --> 00:31:19,282
Let me out!

274
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:59,456
Sophie? What's going on?
What happened?

275
00:32:02,626 --> 00:32:05,128
Hey, hey. It's okay.

276
00:32:06,563 --> 00:32:07,597
What happened?

277
00:32:09,432 --> 00:32:10,834
What happened?

278
00:32:10,867 --> 00:32:13,336
Of course, her boyfriend comes
to her rescue.

279
00:32:16,806 --> 00:32:18,375
Do you think it's funny?

280
00:32:21,244 --> 00:32:22,279
Do you?

281
00:32:31,888 --> 00:32:35,058
It's okay. It's over.

282
00:32:37,894 --> 00:32:39,396
What happened in there?

283
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,132
You can tell me.

284
00:32:45,468 --> 00:32:47,070
-Nothing.
-Sophie?

285
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,108
Why aren't you in class?

286
00:32:52,142 --> 00:32:53,710
Oh, this isn't her fault.

287
00:32:53,743 --> 00:32:55,412
The older girls
were playing some--

288
00:32:55,445 --> 00:32:56,646
I'm sorry, Mom.

289
00:32:58,481 --> 00:32:59,549
Excuse us.

290
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:02,118
Sure.

291
00:33:02,152 --> 00:33:03,286
Are you all right?

292
00:33:19,202 --> 00:33:20,470
Sister Astrid?

293
00:33:20,503 --> 00:33:21,538
Welcome to Tarascon.

294
00:33:21,571 --> 00:33:23,873
Please come in.

295
00:33:23,907 --> 00:33:27,510
We still have mass,
but no one comes.

296
00:33:27,544 --> 00:33:29,879
People believe
it was the devil.

297
00:33:29,913 --> 00:33:34,618
They say our church is cursed,
that God has abandoned us.

298
00:33:48,732 --> 00:33:50,200
This is where we found him.

299
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,340
Sister?

300
00:35:08,478 --> 00:35:09,612
Are you okay?

301
00:35:12,315 --> 00:35:13,349
I'm fine.

302
00:35:17,854 --> 00:35:19,856
Can we see
Father Noiret's room, please?

303
00:35:21,591 --> 00:35:22,659
Of course.

304
00:35:31,668 --> 00:35:32,569
Creepy.

305
00:35:33,903 --> 00:35:35,305
Saint Lucy.

306
00:35:35,338 --> 00:35:37,407
Patron Saint of the blind.

307
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,842
She was murdered by pagans.

308
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:40,844
They lit her on fire,
but she wouldn't burn.

309
00:35:40,877 --> 00:35:43,346
Before killing her,
they gouged out her eyes.

310
00:35:44,814 --> 00:35:47,350
Found them. Please.

311
00:36:00,363 --> 00:36:02,866
There was a boy that night?
A witness?

312
00:36:02,899 --> 00:36:05,502
Yes. Jacques.
He saw everything.

313
00:36:06,603 --> 00:36:07,971
Where can we find him?

314
00:36:08,005 --> 00:36:10,440
His mother doesn't want him
talking about it.

315
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:14,844
But you might find him
playing football in town.

316
00:36:14,878 --> 00:36:16,946
Was there anyone else
in the church?

317
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,581
We had a handyman.

318
00:36:18,615 --> 00:36:20,717
He left the day
after it happened.

319
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,619
Do you know where he went?

320
00:36:22,652 --> 00:36:24,754
I don't know.

321
00:36:24,788 --> 00:36:28,391
But he was a world traveler.
He came from Romania.

322
00:36:28,424 --> 00:36:30,094
That is where he got
his nickname.

323
00:36:30,127 --> 00:36:32,629
They used to call him...

324
00:36:32,662 --> 00:36:34,031
-"Frenchie."
-Frenchie.

325
00:36:36,432 --> 00:36:38,035
Where are you
headed next?

326
00:36:38,068 --> 00:36:40,703
Well, I have enough money
to get me to Hungary,

327
00:36:40,737 --> 00:36:42,906
and from there,
the world is my oyster.

328
00:36:44,374 --> 00:36:46,376
At least Hungary is.

329
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:49,579
-You saved my life.
-That? That was nothing.

330
00:36:49,612 --> 00:36:53,083
No, you've just fell into a...
what do you call it? Um...

331
00:36:53,117 --> 00:36:54,517
a life debt.

332
00:36:55,085 --> 00:36:56,786
It's very simple.

333
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:00,024
You and I will be bound
together for all eternity.

334
00:37:05,395 --> 00:37:06,763
I almost forgot.

335
00:37:06,796 --> 00:37:09,632
It's nothing, just a thank you.

336
00:37:13,603 --> 00:37:16,006
Tomato seeds. Thank you.

337
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,408
You said you wanted a farm
some day.

338
00:37:18,441 --> 00:37:19,676
You have to start somewhere.

339
00:37:21,978 --> 00:37:24,814
I'll miss you, Irene.

340
00:37:39,762 --> 00:37:40,730
Irene?

341
00:37:42,732 --> 00:37:44,434
Who is this Frenchie guy?

342
00:37:46,502 --> 00:37:48,771
His name is Maurice.

343
00:37:48,805 --> 00:37:51,041
Back at Saint Carta,
he was our guide.

344
00:37:51,075 --> 00:37:55,411
When I faced the demon,
he came back for me.

345
00:37:58,481 --> 00:37:59,649
<i>He saved my life.</i>

346
00:38:02,452 --> 00:38:04,921
That's when
it happened.

347
00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:12,162
It's how the demon escaped.

348
00:38:12,196 --> 00:38:15,465
That's how it's moving,
doing these things.

349
00:38:15,498 --> 00:38:17,700
So, he's... possessed.

350
00:38:28,511 --> 00:38:29,179
Maurice.

351
00:38:30,747 --> 00:38:32,949
Hi. Hello again.

352
00:38:34,684 --> 00:38:37,221
I realized
I never said thank you.

353
00:38:37,254 --> 00:38:39,822
-Sophie told me what you did.
-Oh. No.

354
00:38:39,856 --> 00:38:42,659
Those girls
are little monsters.

355
00:38:42,692 --> 00:38:45,795
They're not all bad. Just some.

356
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,071
Look... the chapel, why does
Madame keep it locked up?

357
00:38:54,104 --> 00:38:56,806
Uh, it's dangerous.

358
00:38:56,839 --> 00:38:59,642
Her son was killed inside
during the bombings.

359
00:39:01,011 --> 00:39:03,213
Cedric. He was an altar boy.

360
00:39:04,647 --> 00:39:06,250
I didn't know she had a son.

361
00:39:06,283 --> 00:39:08,085
She doesn't talk about it.

362
00:39:08,118 --> 00:39:12,022
Madame is a hard woman,
but she's been very good to us.

363
00:39:18,661 --> 00:39:21,831
Ah. I should get back
to the children.

364
00:39:21,864 --> 00:39:24,500
Sure, yes. And I should
get back to my work.

365
00:39:45,222 --> 00:39:46,522
Caught you!

366
00:39:47,324 --> 00:39:49,592
What were you doing?

367
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:51,995
-Nothing.
-You were spying.

368
00:39:53,696 --> 00:39:56,033
-Maybe.
-Maybe?

369
00:39:56,066 --> 00:39:58,835
Maybe, probably,
absolutely definitely.

370
00:40:01,071 --> 00:40:04,141
-What were you talking about?
-Nothing.

371
00:40:05,575 --> 00:40:07,944
It was something.
He was making you laugh.

372
00:40:09,146 --> 00:40:10,947
That is none of your business.

373
00:40:12,582 --> 00:40:15,718
Now, let's go. No more spying.

374
00:40:21,758 --> 00:40:23,027
Hey!

375
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:35,072
Sophie?

376
00:40:40,977 --> 00:40:41,978
Mom?

377
00:40:56,692 --> 00:40:57,560
Mom?

378
00:41:17,914 --> 00:41:18,881
Mom?

379
00:41:46,176 --> 00:41:47,311
Mom?

380
00:42:35,992 --> 00:42:38,395
Come on now, girls. Quick.
Quickly.

381
00:42:38,428 --> 00:42:39,862
<i>Vite! Vite!</i>

382
00:42:43,066 --> 00:42:44,867
Sophie!

383
00:42:44,901 --> 00:42:46,736
Where did you run off to?

384
00:42:46,769 --> 00:42:48,871
-I've been looking for you.
-Mom?

385
00:42:50,307 --> 00:42:51,175
Quick.

386
00:42:54,344 --> 00:42:57,214
What's next?
Is this just a big dead end?

387
00:42:59,049 --> 00:43:00,950
No. There's something here.

388
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:06,789
What? You...
You sense something?

389
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:09,692
Something like that.

390
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,162
My Sisters.

391
00:43:12,196 --> 00:43:13,130
I have
a reservation,

392
00:43:13,163 --> 00:43:14,431
under Irene Palmer.

393
00:43:14,464 --> 00:43:15,865
Palmer?

394
00:43:17,167 --> 00:43:20,170
Hm. I'm afraid I can't find it.

395
00:43:20,204 --> 00:43:23,706
What? That's not possible.
I have a reservation.

396
00:43:24,874 --> 00:43:26,742
Madam, it's not here.

397
00:43:26,776 --> 00:43:28,245
Let me just take care of it.

398
00:43:28,278 --> 00:43:30,813
Um, sir, can we please speak
to a manager?

399
00:43:32,149 --> 00:43:33,450
-Certainly, madam.
-Thank you.

400
00:43:37,521 --> 00:43:39,956
<i>Vite! Vite!</i>

401
00:43:58,542 --> 00:43:59,409
Jacques?

402
00:44:09,253 --> 00:44:10,320
You're the boy.

403
00:44:13,357 --> 00:44:15,392
Don't be scared.
My name's Irene.

404
00:44:15,425 --> 00:44:16,959
The Church sent me to help.

405
00:44:16,993 --> 00:44:18,894
I know you were there
that night.

406
00:44:19,862 --> 00:44:20,997
You saw it.

407
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:34,944
That night,
did you have a rosary?

408
00:44:34,977 --> 00:44:37,547
No. It was Father Noiret's.

409
00:44:37,581 --> 00:44:40,183
-What?
-I took it.

410
00:44:40,217 --> 00:44:41,485
I'm sorry, I was scared.

411
00:44:53,397 --> 00:44:55,299
Jacques! Wait!

412
00:45:26,196 --> 00:45:27,230
Jacques?

413
00:49:21,665 --> 00:49:23,199
Irene?

414
00:49:25,135 --> 00:49:26,102
Irene!

415
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:32,576
Irene! Irene!

416
00:49:32,609 --> 00:49:35,412
Irene, wake up!
Oh, my God. Wake up.

417
00:49:35,445 --> 00:49:38,181
-We need a doctor.
-Help! Help!

418
00:49:38,214 --> 00:49:41,151
Somebody help! I need a doctor!

419
00:49:42,385 --> 00:49:43,386
Irene.

420
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,555
Somebody help!

421
00:49:59,302 --> 00:50:02,572
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

422
00:50:02,606 --> 00:50:04,474
Blessed are thou among women--

423
00:51:08,638 --> 00:51:09,639
Maurice?

424
00:51:30,393 --> 00:51:31,461
Maurice.

425
00:51:41,738 --> 00:51:42,772
Madame Laurent?

426
00:51:43,773 --> 00:51:45,709
What are you doing?

427
00:51:45,742 --> 00:51:47,577
I don't know.
I don't know.

428
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:49,846
-I don't know.
-Go back to your room.

429
00:51:49,879 --> 00:51:50,647
Yes.

430
00:51:52,716 --> 00:51:55,385
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine.

431
00:51:55,418 --> 00:51:56,953
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine.

432
00:51:56,986 --> 00:51:59,656
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!

433
00:52:09,033 --> 00:52:10,333
Mama!

434
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:22,372
Who is in here?

435
00:54:00,577 --> 00:54:01,711
Cedric?

436
00:55:12,615 --> 00:55:13,917
Cedric.

437
00:55:28,165 --> 00:55:29,166
Stop!

438
00:55:56,693 --> 00:55:59,163
There she is,
back from the dead.

439
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:03,200
-Thank you, Doctor.
-You're welcome, Sister.

440
00:56:08,571 --> 00:56:10,074
What happened last night?

441
00:56:18,781 --> 00:56:21,051
We're close.

442
00:56:21,085 --> 00:56:24,154
I had a vision.
I saw what the demon wants.

443
00:56:25,955 --> 00:56:28,558
It's powerful.

444
00:56:28,591 --> 00:56:31,494
Some coveted prize,
some ancient relic.

445
00:56:34,664 --> 00:56:36,233
It's been using Maurice
to get it.

446
00:56:38,634 --> 00:56:39,902
<i>Driving him.</i>

447
00:56:41,138 --> 00:56:43,773
<i>Draining him.</i>

448
00:56:43,806 --> 00:56:47,077
<i>Keeping him alive</i>
<i>just to find this thing.</i>

449
00:56:48,878 --> 00:56:50,780
It's going to kill him
when it's done.

450
00:56:55,785 --> 00:56:58,222
The altar boy.

451
00:56:58,255 --> 00:57:00,723
I-I forgot to tell you,
I found him.

452
00:57:00,757 --> 00:57:02,725
-What?
-Well, he found me.

453
00:57:02,759 --> 00:57:05,262
He came by when you were out.
He gave me this.

454
00:57:16,939 --> 00:57:18,175
Father Noiret's rosary.

455
00:57:21,744 --> 00:57:23,147
The symbol, it...

456
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:27,650
it seems so familiar,
but I can't place it.

457
00:57:27,683 --> 00:57:29,652
I can. The photos.

458
00:57:34,024 --> 00:57:35,892
I think I saw that
on one of the victims.

459
00:57:36,626 --> 00:57:37,627
Look.

460
00:57:38,328 --> 00:57:39,796
It's a connection.

461
00:57:47,837 --> 00:57:49,273
If we find out what this means,

462
00:57:49,306 --> 00:57:51,141
we might be able to find out
where it's headed.

463
00:57:51,175 --> 00:57:52,942
How are we gonna do that?

464
00:57:54,378 --> 00:57:56,380
I have a friend
in the Catholic archives.

465
00:59:03,013 --> 00:59:05,781
I can't find Sophie.
Have you seen her?

466
00:59:06,949 --> 00:59:09,052
No, I...

467
00:59:09,086 --> 00:59:12,256
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't worry. She can't be far.

468
00:59:12,289 --> 00:59:13,723
I'll find her, all right?

469
00:59:14,957 --> 00:59:15,992
Sophie!

470
00:59:28,205 --> 00:59:29,373
Sophie!

471
00:59:54,264 --> 00:59:55,332
Sophie.

472
00:59:58,935 --> 00:59:59,936
Hey.

473
01:00:05,942 --> 01:00:08,178
This is quite
a spot you've got.

474
01:00:08,212 --> 01:00:09,279
May I join you?

475
01:00:11,181 --> 01:00:12,316
What for?

476
01:00:13,916 --> 01:00:14,984
Just to talk.

477
01:00:26,563 --> 01:00:28,831
Madame never went
into the chapel.

478
01:00:30,434 --> 01:00:32,802
I don't know why
she went in there last night.

479
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:38,208
There's something wrong
with this school.

480
01:00:39,976 --> 01:00:42,312
There's something
that doesn't feel right.

481
01:00:45,115 --> 01:00:46,949
It's like
there's something here...

482
01:00:48,884 --> 01:00:50,354
that's not meant to be.

483
01:00:53,023 --> 01:00:54,024
Sophie?

484
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:57,793
What happened?

485
01:00:58,995 --> 01:01:01,198
Did you see something?
Anything?

486
01:01:02,132 --> 01:01:03,233
N-no.

487
01:01:05,935 --> 01:01:07,337
It's just a feeling.

488
01:01:09,339 --> 01:01:12,342
Hey, it's okay to be scared.

489
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:16,246
I'm scared, too.

490
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:18,981
There's been times in my life

491
01:01:19,016 --> 01:01:21,418
where fear has
made me do things

492
01:01:21,451 --> 01:01:23,186
I never thought possible.

493
01:01:27,324 --> 01:01:29,526
You kept my bracelet.

494
01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:32,928
Yeah, well, I tried to sell it.
No one would buy it.

495
01:01:36,366 --> 01:01:38,868
Come on,
we should head back down.

496
01:01:38,901 --> 01:01:40,936
Your mother is worried, okay?

497
01:01:42,205 --> 01:01:43,939
She's always worried.

498
01:01:43,973 --> 01:01:46,576
Don't know why.
Maybe she loves you?

499
01:01:48,944 --> 01:01:52,049
Come on. I just hope
she doesn't ground you.

500
01:02:10,966 --> 01:02:13,603
-Excuse us.
-I'm so sorry. God bless you.

501
01:02:28,984 --> 01:02:30,153
<i>Where did</i>
<i>you find it?</i>

502
01:02:30,187 --> 01:02:31,954
<i>Tarascon.</i>

503
01:02:31,987 --> 01:02:34,257
-This belonged to the priest?
-Yes, how did you know?

504
01:02:34,291 --> 01:02:36,059
I've been speaking
to the Vatican.

505
01:02:36,093 --> 01:02:39,062
They tell me the demon
of Saint Carta has returned.

506
01:02:40,464 --> 01:02:42,165
It's a family crest.

507
01:02:42,199 --> 01:02:43,266
Whose family?

508
01:02:46,570 --> 01:02:49,506
Saint Lucy of Syracuse.

509
01:02:49,539 --> 01:02:52,409
These victims
must be her descendants.

510
01:02:52,442 --> 01:02:53,443
Saint Lucy?

511
01:03:00,183 --> 01:03:01,518
I think I know what it wants.

512
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:04,887
What?

513
01:03:05,988 --> 01:03:07,457
The eyes.

514
01:03:07,491 --> 01:03:10,527
The eyes? W-What eyes?

515
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:14,064
When Lucy was murdered
by pagans, her family escaped.

516
01:03:14,097 --> 01:03:15,365
They were hunted.

517
01:03:18,034 --> 01:03:19,636
Scattered across the globe.

518
01:03:19,669 --> 01:03:22,372
All this time, they've been
protecting a secret.

519
01:03:22,406 --> 01:03:23,440
A holy relic.

520
01:03:24,608 --> 01:03:26,543
The eyes of Saint Lucy.

521
01:03:29,413 --> 01:03:35,152
So, the demon
is after a... pair of eyes?

522
01:03:35,185 --> 01:03:38,688
-Why would it want that?
-It's a demon.

523
01:03:38,722 --> 01:03:42,259
I'm just a glorified librarian,
I couldn't begin to guess.

524
01:03:43,527 --> 01:03:47,464
But, if we're
sharing theories...

525
01:03:47,497 --> 01:03:52,402
you might like to consider that
this demon was once an angel.

526
01:03:56,406 --> 01:03:57,674
Rejected by God.

527
01:03:59,075 --> 01:04:00,477
Stripped of his holy power

528
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:03,246
that God so casually
gave to His saints.

529
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,182
It wants that power back.

530
01:04:05,215 --> 01:04:07,050
Demons are infinite.

531
01:04:07,083 --> 01:04:08,552
It was there with Saint Lucy

532
01:04:08,585 --> 01:04:11,221
and it's been hunting
the bloodline ever since.

533
01:04:11,254 --> 01:04:14,357
This relic is an item
of great power.

534
01:04:14,391 --> 01:04:17,394
In the hands of a demon,
it would be unthinkable.

535
01:04:17,427 --> 01:04:20,063
But in your hands,
it could be a weapon.

536
01:04:20,096 --> 01:04:23,533
Just as you used the blood
of Christ at Saint Carta.

537
01:04:23,567 --> 01:04:25,235
This is the way you do it.

538
01:04:27,037 --> 01:04:31,074
This is the way you send
that thing back to hell.

539
01:04:34,678 --> 01:04:36,213
We just don't know where it is.

540
01:04:38,248 --> 01:04:39,149
I might.

541
01:04:40,584 --> 01:04:42,252
We've been
cataloguing these relics,

542
01:04:42,285 --> 01:04:44,187
chasing down rumors and so on,

543
01:04:44,221 --> 01:04:45,755
and if my memory
serves me correct,

544
01:04:45,789 --> 01:04:48,091
this one found its way
to a monk.

545
01:04:49,793 --> 01:04:51,728
Jean-Paul Redar.

546
01:04:51,761 --> 01:04:54,431
According to letters
that he wrote to the Vatican,

547
01:04:54,464 --> 01:04:57,634
he buried the eyes
somewhere within his monastery.

548
01:04:57,667 --> 01:05:01,571
Saint Mary's, Aix-en-Provence.

549
01:05:01,605 --> 01:05:05,208
-It's about an hour from here.
-Is it still a monastery?

550
01:05:06,576 --> 01:05:10,213
No, it was sold to a winery
and now...

551
01:05:13,483 --> 01:05:14,784
it's a boarding school.

552
01:05:27,464 --> 01:05:32,168
Irene, wait. Whatever happens
tonight, don't hesitate.

553
01:05:32,202 --> 01:05:34,671
We don't really know
what this relic can do.

554
01:05:34,704 --> 01:05:36,806
The same goes for the demon.

555
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:39,209
<i>It will take any form,</i>

556
01:05:39,242 --> 01:05:42,412
<i>and it will choose its form</i>
<i>to prey on your fears,</i>

557
01:05:42,445 --> 01:05:45,148
<i>and the fears</i>
<i>of those around you.</i>

558
01:05:45,181 --> 01:05:48,785
<i>You must be prepared</i>
<i>to stop it, at all costs.</i>

559
01:06:00,597 --> 01:06:03,466
-What are you making?
-It's called feijoada.

560
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:06,236
-It's a Portuguese stew.
-What's in it?

561
01:06:09,272 --> 01:06:10,273
Slugs.

562
01:06:11,875 --> 01:06:13,076
And snails.

563
01:06:26,289 --> 01:06:27,257
I lied to you.

564
01:06:28,592 --> 01:06:29,893
About what?

565
01:06:29,926 --> 01:06:31,795
I said I didn't remember
my mother.

566
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:34,731
But I do.

567
01:06:37,667 --> 01:06:39,469
I remember everything
about her.

568
01:06:41,171 --> 01:06:43,673
<i>She was deeply religious.</i>

569
01:06:43,707 --> 01:06:45,909
<i>She said that God</i>
<i>spoke directly to her,</i>

570
01:06:45,942 --> 01:06:47,811
<i>that He showed her things.</i>

571
01:06:47,844 --> 01:06:48,812
<i>Visions.</i>

572
01:06:50,547 --> 01:06:51,414
Like me.

573
01:06:52,716 --> 01:06:54,751
My father didn't believe her.

574
01:06:54,784 --> 01:06:56,353
He said she was insane.

575
01:06:58,421 --> 01:06:59,556
Heretical.

576
01:06:59,589 --> 01:07:01,224
What happened to her?

577
01:07:02,492 --> 01:07:04,327
My father brought her
to a doctor.

578
01:07:06,463 --> 01:07:08,398
Then they came back
and took her away.

579
01:07:08,431 --> 01:07:10,800
I will always be with you.

580
01:07:15,338 --> 01:07:16,640
I never saw her again.

581
01:07:29,452 --> 01:07:30,520
Wow!

582
01:07:32,522 --> 01:07:34,257
You always turn, make me turn.

583
01:07:41,464 --> 01:07:42,365
My lady.

584
01:07:45,468 --> 01:07:47,170
Mom, it's your turn.

585
01:07:49,539 --> 01:07:51,241
No, I shouldn't.

586
01:07:51,274 --> 01:07:52,342
Please?

587
01:07:56,846 --> 01:07:57,781
Please?

588
01:08:00,850 --> 01:08:01,851
All right.

589
01:09:00,343 --> 01:09:01,478
Are you all right?

590
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:06,950
Yeah. It's... It's nothing.

591
01:09:06,983 --> 01:09:08,618
-Okay.
-It's nothing.

592
01:09:12,522 --> 01:09:13,590
Maurice!

593
01:09:35,512 --> 01:09:37,580
There's
something under your skin.

594
01:09:54,131 --> 01:09:55,331
Oh, no.

595
01:09:59,469 --> 01:10:02,039
Come on! Come on!
We've gotta go! Come on!

596
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:12,816
This way! This way! Come on!

597
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:19,989
God! Sister.

598
01:10:20,024 --> 01:10:21,391
Maurice!

599
01:10:22,659 --> 01:10:24,894
It's back. It's here.

600
01:10:24,928 --> 01:10:26,796
-Maurice, I need you to--
-Kate, this is Irene.

601
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:29,066
-No, Maurice, no, you need to--
-She's my friend.

602
01:10:29,099 --> 01:10:31,401
-We've got to go.
-Get away from them!

603
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:34,537
What?

604
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,474
We need to go, now!

605
01:10:38,508 --> 01:10:41,678
-It's you.
-What?

606
01:10:43,546 --> 01:10:45,049
It's inside of you.

607
01:10:48,118 --> 01:10:49,986
No.

608
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:52,022
-No.
-It's my fault.

609
01:10:52,056 --> 01:10:54,390
Because you came back for me,
that's when it happened.

610
01:10:56,593 --> 01:10:59,495
Oh, god! No!

611
01:11:01,965 --> 01:11:05,002
-Maurice, what's happening?
-We can stop it.

612
01:11:31,594 --> 01:11:33,130
Hello, Sister.

613
01:11:45,942 --> 01:11:46,976
Maurice?

614
01:11:54,751 --> 01:11:56,786
Irene, are you okay?

615
01:11:56,819 --> 01:11:57,854
Stop him.

616
01:12:14,737 --> 01:12:16,639
Out, demon!

617
01:12:18,142 --> 01:12:20,743
In the name of God
and the Holy Spirit,

618
01:12:20,777 --> 01:12:22,946
I command you, leave this man!

619
01:12:28,685 --> 01:12:29,953
Let him be!

620
01:12:55,645 --> 01:12:56,846
You think that'll hold him?

621
01:13:01,018 --> 01:13:01,918
Let's work quick.

622
01:13:08,158 --> 01:13:10,060
-Are you two okay?
-What was that?

623
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:12,562
-What's wrong with him?
-He's... sick.

624
01:13:12,595 --> 01:13:15,032
We're going to help him,
but we need your help.

625
01:13:15,065 --> 01:13:16,866
He was headed
in that direction.

626
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:18,801
What's in there?

627
01:13:20,004 --> 01:13:21,038
That's the chapel.

628
01:13:25,942 --> 01:13:27,744
What are you
looking for?

629
01:13:27,777 --> 01:13:29,146
It's an ancient relic

630
01:13:29,179 --> 01:13:32,316
left here by a monk
named Jean-Paul Redar.

631
01:13:32,349 --> 01:13:35,085
-Ring any bells?
-I'm just a teacher.

632
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:37,021
No one's even allowed in here.

633
01:13:37,054 --> 01:13:40,057
Redar would have left some way
for the descendants to find it.

634
01:13:44,627 --> 01:13:45,828
What are you looking at?

635
01:13:54,004 --> 01:13:54,971
The goat.

636
01:13:56,706 --> 01:13:57,874
It's the devil.

637
01:13:59,809 --> 01:14:02,279
It's just a game the kids play.

638
01:14:02,312 --> 01:14:03,913
What kind of game?

639
01:14:03,946 --> 01:14:05,815
The sun shines
through the window,

640
01:14:05,848 --> 01:14:07,683
and it makes the goat's eyes
glow red.

641
01:14:10,753 --> 01:14:13,090
It's the devil. It watches you.

642
01:14:30,907 --> 01:14:31,974
Just there.

643
01:14:46,223 --> 01:14:48,058
Anything?

644
01:14:48,092 --> 01:14:49,959
No, not yet.

645
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:54,997
You're a little high.
Can you go lower?

646
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:00,037
Wait. Wait, wait!

647
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:01,637
Go back up slowly.

648
01:15:06,009 --> 01:15:06,876
Stop!

649
01:15:12,116 --> 01:15:12,982
That's it.

650
01:15:35,938 --> 01:15:36,806
We got it.

651
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:39,143
We got it!

652
01:16:16,213 --> 01:16:17,080
Sophie?

653
01:16:43,839 --> 01:16:45,475
Sophie?

654
01:17:06,296 --> 01:17:09,032
Celeste,
did you hear that?

655
01:17:14,071 --> 01:17:15,505
There's someone upstairs.

656
01:17:19,476 --> 01:17:20,377
Go take a look.

657
01:18:09,493 --> 01:18:10,960
Wait.

658
01:18:10,993 --> 01:18:12,095
Wait!

659
01:18:39,489 --> 01:18:40,956
The eyes of Saint Lucy.

660
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:18,628
-Hi.
-Who are you?

661
01:19:18,662 --> 01:19:20,397
It's okay,
I'm a friend of Kate's.

662
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:24,934
I think
there's someone upstairs.

663
01:19:49,326 --> 01:19:50,394
What the hell?

664
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:14,418
What are you doing?

665
01:20:14,451 --> 01:20:15,419
Who's that?

666
01:20:21,258 --> 01:20:22,592
What is that thing?

667
01:20:26,263 --> 01:20:27,431
It's the devil.

668
01:20:57,661 --> 01:20:58,562
The girls!

669
01:21:07,170 --> 01:21:08,971
Mom! Mom!

670
01:24:24,601 --> 01:24:25,835
What's she doing?

671
01:24:28,405 --> 01:24:29,739
It's Madame Laurent.

672
01:24:29,773 --> 01:24:31,608
What?

673
01:24:31,641 --> 01:24:33,943
She's standing in her room.

674
01:24:41,785 --> 01:24:43,553
No! No!

675
01:25:27,997 --> 01:25:28,932
Sophie?

676
01:25:32,769 --> 01:25:35,805
Sophie, it's me, Maurice.

677
01:25:38,675 --> 01:25:41,311
Don't be afraid.
I'm your friend.

678
01:25:50,954 --> 01:25:53,790
Sophie! Sophie!

679
01:26:02,398 --> 01:26:04,001
Sophie.

680
01:26:13,343 --> 01:26:17,280
I would never hurt you.

681
01:26:18,082 --> 01:26:20,483
Remember, Captain?

682
01:26:53,883 --> 01:26:54,851
The eyes.

683
01:29:22,299 --> 01:29:24,500
Sophie!

684
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:32,176
Sophie!

685
01:29:46,190 --> 01:29:47,991
-Sophie!
-Irene!

686
01:29:49,692 --> 01:29:50,994
Are you okay?

687
01:29:51,028 --> 01:29:52,129
I have it.

688
01:30:00,970 --> 01:30:01,971
Demon!

689
01:30:05,842 --> 01:30:06,976
Irene!

690
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:14,951
Be gone!

691
01:30:19,323 --> 01:30:20,823
You're hurting him!

692
01:30:25,162 --> 01:30:26,662
Sister, please.

693
01:30:27,764 --> 01:30:28,865
It's killing me.

694
01:30:37,807 --> 01:30:39,642
No!

695
01:30:49,119 --> 01:30:50,653
No!

696
01:32:02,925 --> 01:32:03,993
Where's Sophie?

697
01:32:45,102 --> 01:32:46,136
Stay close.

698
01:33:26,842 --> 01:33:28,011
Up, up!

699
01:33:29,546 --> 01:33:31,714
Go, go!

700
01:33:32,882 --> 01:33:34,351
The doors! The doors!

701
01:33:40,123 --> 01:33:41,991
Save me, oh God, by thy name.

702
01:33:43,527 --> 01:33:45,162
No!

703
01:34:18,961 --> 01:34:20,963
Get that plank!

704
01:34:38,914 --> 01:34:41,585
Get back in the chapel!
Simone, come with me.

705
01:34:54,164 --> 01:34:56,066
Stay behind me.

706
01:35:24,094 --> 01:35:24,994
No!

707
01:35:36,573 --> 01:35:38,375
<i>I will always</i>
<i>be with you.</i>

708
01:35:45,115 --> 01:35:46,249
<i>Look at me.</i>

709
01:36:13,443 --> 01:36:15,245
Are you okay?

710
01:36:15,278 --> 01:36:17,414
-Yes.
-That was a miracle.

711
01:36:24,654 --> 01:36:25,655
The wine.

712
01:36:31,094 --> 01:36:33,663
Sophie! Sophie!

713
01:36:42,339 --> 01:36:46,343
-Irene!
-No. No, Maurice, no!

714
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:50,547
No!

715
01:36:53,083 --> 01:36:55,951
Maurice, no! No!

716
01:36:57,421 --> 01:36:59,022
Help me!

717
01:36:59,055 --> 01:37:01,991
Stop!

718
01:37:02,025 --> 01:37:03,093
Sister.

719
01:37:04,494 --> 01:37:05,662
Pray with me.

720
01:37:15,739 --> 01:37:18,475
This is the cup
of my blood.

721
01:37:18,508 --> 01:37:20,043
<i>When Lucy was murdered,</i>

722
01:37:20,076 --> 01:37:21,645
<i>her family escaped.</i>

723
01:37:21,678 --> 01:37:24,748
<i>They were hunted,</i>
<i>scattered across the globe.</i>

724
01:37:24,781 --> 01:37:28,385
The blood of the new
and everlasting covenant.

725
01:37:28,418 --> 01:37:30,554
That will be shed for you
and for all

726
01:37:30,587 --> 01:37:33,989
so that your sins
may be forgiven.

727
01:37:34,024 --> 01:37:35,358
<i>I said</i>
<i>I didn't remember my mother,</i>

728
01:37:35,392 --> 01:37:36,693
<i>but I do.</i>

729
01:37:36,726 --> 01:37:39,095
Saint Lucy,
Patron Saint of the blind.

730
01:37:39,129 --> 01:37:41,031
<i>They lit her on fire,</i>
<i>but she wouldn't burn.</i>

731
01:37:41,064 --> 01:37:43,733
Do this in memory of me.

732
01:37:43,767 --> 01:37:46,036
<i>These victims</i>
<i>must be her descendants.</i>

733
01:37:48,772 --> 01:37:50,173
You have my eyes.

734
01:37:57,147 --> 01:37:58,548
Amen.

735
01:39:32,742 --> 01:39:34,210
Sister...

736
01:39:37,447 --> 01:39:38,848
you saved me.

737
01:41:00,997 --> 01:41:02,232
Maurice.

738
01:41:23,853 --> 01:41:25,755
I'm sorry.

739
01:41:25,789 --> 01:41:29,259
-I'm so sorry.
-It's okay.

740
01:41:31,795 --> 01:41:32,696
I'm sorry.

741
01:44:30,573 --> 01:44:32,742
<i>Mr. Warren?</i>

742
01:44:32,775 --> 01:44:33,877
<i>Mr. Warren?</i>

743
01:44:34,878 --> 01:44:36,080
<i>It's Father Gordon.</i>

744
01:44:37,780 --> 01:44:39,415
He says it's an emergency.

745
01:44:46,489 --> 01:44:47,590
Yes, Father.

746
01:44:48,791 --> 01:44:49,792
How can we help?
