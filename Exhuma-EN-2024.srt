1
00:01:00,216 --> 00:01:05,190
Sir, we will be arriving soon.
Would you like some more of the same wine?

2
00:01:06,617 --> 00:01:08,318
No,
it's okay

3
00:01:09,055 --> 00:01:10,735
}And I

4
00:01:10,976 --> 00:01:11,976
I'm Korean.

5
00:01:12,454 --> 00:01:14,700
That's right,
I'm sorry

6
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,350
Have a comfortable flight

7
00:01:31,547 --> 00:01:34,175
Our representative...

8
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,713
Well, your main
business is real estate...

9
00:01:37,738 --> 00:01:39,699
There is quite a lot of land in Korea.

10
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:42,819
Are you doing investment business here and there in the U.S. ?

11
00:01:43,097 --> 00:01:44,973
Well,
there are people like that.

12
00:01:44,998 --> 00:01:46,968
People born
rich

13
00:01:46,993 --> 00:01:49,703
Just a rich person with no bottom or end

14
00:01:52,707 --> 00:01:54,831
<i>How can I trust them?

15
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:57,785
<i>You should have considered my opinion

16
00:01:58,411 --> 00:02:01,121
<i>These
are completely different situations

17
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:01,915
<i>I don't understand

18
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:04,083
just do whatever you
want

19
00:02:16,197 --> 00:02:20,058
<i> I'm calmed down now because of the medication

20
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:22,982
<i> Doesn't stop crying since birth

21
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,063
<i> I tried all the famous medical staff, but...

22
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:28,013
<i>Well, medically

23
00:02:28,038 --> 00:02:29,513
<i>
There is no problem...

24
00:02:30,815 --> 00:02:32,695
<i>We have heard it all

25
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:43,010
Sorry, but
can it be just us?

26
00:02:43,104 --> 00:02:44,249
yes?

27
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:53,366
Cheonjoneon Sinjungguryeong Habulsoji

28
00:02:53,391 --> 00:02:56,653
Ilwal Cheonsaeng Iwal Muyeong
Samwal Hyeonju Sawal Jeongjung

29
00:02:56,678 --> 00:03:00,089
Ohwalhyeoldan Yukwalnoenoe Chilwaldanwon
Palwaltaeyeon Guwalyeongdong

30
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:03,976
Sojijeuk-gil, Shinjung Samjeong, Habulhoji,
Ilwal Taegwang, Iwal Sangryeong, Samwal Yujeong

31
00:03:03,977 --> 00:03:07,563
Hojijeokgyeong, heartache, six
veins, four limbs, spirits, Baekjeol advanced level

32
00:03:07,564 --> 00:03:09,147
It's Uisong Cha-gyeong.

33
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:26,708
There must be more people like you at home .

34
00:03:26,778 --> 00:03:28,418
With my father...

35
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:30,420
grandfather

36
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:40,888
You are talking about Jiyong and your father, right?

37
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:42,806
Those faces...

38
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:43,558
yes

39
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:47,644
- <i>That expression changes from suspicion to surprise
- I think so.

40
00:03:51,453 --> 00:03:53,918
<i>Always live in a bright place

41
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:56,321
<i>People who only look at bright places

42
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:01,133
<i>The world must have bright light

43
00:04:01,134 --> 00:04:03,094
<i>We can see it

44
00:04:03,554 --> 00:04:04,970
<i>And the people

45
00:04:04,971 --> 00:04:08,516
I only believe in things I can see and touch

46
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,855
A world with bright light

47
00:04:15,732 --> 00:04:18,400
And behind it

48
00:04:24,646 --> 00:04:26,618
From long ago, people

49
00:04:26,643 --> 00:04:29,084
I knew those dark beings

50
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,842
Called by various names

51
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:36,306
<i>Ghosts, devils, goblins, monsters

52
00:04:36,878 --> 00:04:41,007
And they always
yearn for bright places and are jealous

53
00:04:41,341 --> 00:04:42,733
Very Occasionally

54
00:04:43,176 --> 00:04:45,720
<i>Sometimes it comes down to foul play

55
00:04:48,574 --> 00:04:51,684
<i>And then
people come to me</i>

56
00:04:55,355 --> 00:04:56,689
<i>Yin and Yang</i>

57
00:04:57,357 --> 00:04:58,867
<i>Science and Superstition</i>

58
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:01,753
<i>The person right in between</i>

59
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,740
<i>I am Lee Hwa-rim, a shaman</i>

60
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:07,985
I received a call from my wife.

61
00:05:08,147 --> 00:05:09,619
This is Park Jiyong

62
00:05:20,196 --> 00:05:21,357
My brother...

63
00:05:21,814 --> 00:05:24,400
He ended up committing suicide in a mental hospital.

64
00:05:24,967 --> 00:05:26,678
From then on, to me...

65
00:05:27,075 --> 00:05:28,326
also...

66
00:05:29,806 --> 00:05:32,114
It also started with my newborn son.

67
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:37,146
When I close my eyes,
someone screams

68
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:39,334
I'm strangling you

69
00:05:40,566 --> 00:05:42,323
Eldest grandchildren...

70
00:05:42,323 --> 00:05:43,847
Blood circulation...

71
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:47,531
Usually , a genetic disease is suspected at first.

72
00:05:47,532 --> 00:05:50,909
Later on, they even move because the house site is a problem.

73
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,449
shadow

74
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,456
I saw a shadow in this house from the beginning.

75
00:05:55,873 --> 00:05:58,126
The shadows pressing on the veins here

76
00:05:59,544 --> 00:06:00,888
maybe

77
00:06:00,912 --> 00:06:03,089
It must be my grandfather's shadow.

78
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:04,632
My grandfather?

79
00:06:04,657 --> 00:06:06,676
To put it simply, it's a cold wind.

80
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:09,442
It is also commonly called oxygen masking.

81
00:06:10,381 --> 00:06:12,550
In other words,
someone among my ancestors

82
00:06:12,575 --> 00:06:14,767
You're complaining about how uncomfortable it is.

83
00:06:15,893 --> 00:06:16,893
Are you sure?

84
00:06:16,894 --> 00:06:17,732
yes

85
00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:19,355
one hundred percent

86
00:06:21,644 --> 00:06:22,645
then...

87
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:25,938
What should I do?

88
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,490
We need to spend money and people.

89
00:06:29,587 --> 00:06:31,200
I can't do it alone

90
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,761
I need to call the experts...

91
00:06:34,746 --> 00:06:36,873
Ai, tsk...

92
00:06:37,623 --> 00:06:40,501
Why are creepy faces passing by?

93
00:07:08,071 --> 00:07:09,376
It's a mess!

94
00:07:09,401 --> 00:07:10,906
It's a mess!

95
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:17,079
Oh,
are you looking at me when I wake you up?

96
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,372
Oh, sorry.

97
00:07:18,373 --> 00:07:20,493
low price

98
00:07:20,584 --> 00:07:21,584
Come on, quickly.

99
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,357
One, two, three!

100
00:07:31,803 --> 00:07:32,845
Whew

101
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:37,213
Um... the water wasn't full.

102
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,454
Oh, sorry for waking you up.

103
00:07:42,356 --> 00:07:43,815
Well, it's clean.

104
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,215
Yes, it is fragrant.

105
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,236
Hey,
why did you put so much in it?

106
00:07:49,237 --> 00:07:50,487
uh?

107
00:07:50,488 --> 00:07:52,114
Ah, this...

108
00:07:52,115 --> 00:07:53,699
Hey, really

109
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,373
Don't put any metal or anything in it.

110
00:07:56,398 --> 00:07:58,403
Inconvenient, huh?

111
00:08:00,123 --> 00:08:01,498
Chairman Kim

112
00:08:01,499 --> 00:08:04,418
Here
is a place for my mother and the elders of the family to lie down.

113
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:06,546
I took care of everything, right?

114
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:08,002
yes, that's right

115
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:13,468
So, everyone
is healthy, their business is prospering, right?

116
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:15,137
Yes, thanks

117
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,058
Even if I dig here again...

118
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,267
This prestigious place is

119
00:08:20,268 --> 00:08:24,064
This is the best of my 40-year career , huh?

120
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:26,858
Ah, look at this,
the five elements are perfect, right?

121
00:08:26,931 --> 00:08:28,609
Right, yes?

122
00:08:29,277 --> 00:08:30,986
You really made me cum.

123
00:08:30,987 --> 00:08:32,195
Oh my, really...

124
00:08:32,196 --> 00:08:33,698
Ah, yes...

125
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,784
So don't worry

126
00:08:37,201 --> 00:08:39,829
I think it's right to bury it again.

127
00:08:40,246 --> 00:08:43,038
If Mr. Kim
says so, then so be it.

128
00:08:43,124 --> 00:08:44,250
Ah, but

129
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,586
Ah, why do you keep appearing in my children’s dreams?

130
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:49,196
These days, my wife also
says she can see her mother...

131
00:08:50,131 --> 00:08:51,299
Go undertaker!

132
00:08:51,924 --> 00:08:53,468
Are you done yet?

133
00:08:53,577 --> 00:08:54,924
Hey, I'm hungry.

134
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:58,056
I’m hungry too,
this person is hungry too

135
00:08:58,128 --> 00:09:00,850
No, someone
made the claim without checking, huh?

136
00:09:00,921 --> 00:09:02,100
- Is that the number?
- yes

137
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:02,947
it's okay

138
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,798
Who has this grandma?

139
00:09:22,622 --> 00:09:24,778
Who has grandma's dentures?

140
00:09:36,761 --> 00:09:38,179
Have you ever...

141
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:40,473
Does grandma have dentures?

142
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:42,100
Sanghyun, you

143
00:09:42,157 --> 00:09:43,692
That thing in the closet

144
00:09:43,746 --> 00:09:45,018
Do you have dentures, grandma?

145
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:47,355
No, that's you...

146
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,806
I burned all of my grandmother's things...

147
00:09:50,483 --> 00:09:52,235
I don't have grandma anymore...

148
00:09:53,244 --> 00:09:54,695
dad...

149
00:09:54,696 --> 00:09:56,947
I must have something...

150
00:09:56,948 --> 00:09:58,490
baby

151
00:09:58,491 --> 00:10:00,951
What should I give to my grandmother when she is hungry ?

152
00:10:00,952 --> 00:10:02,786
Then I...

153
00:10:02,787 --> 00:10:05,411
What do you remember about your grandmother?

154
00:10:05,436 --> 00:10:07,950
There's nothing...

155
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:09,752
Did you say it was Sanghyeon?

156
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:11,009
Sanghyeonah

157
00:10:11,587 --> 00:10:13,381
Grandma is

158
00:10:13,756 --> 00:10:15,508
always by your side

159
00:10:24,193 --> 00:10:25,276
<i>It's blood</i>

160
00:10:26,436 --> 00:10:28,687
<i>You can never escape even if you die</i>

161
00:10:28,688 --> 00:10:30,605
- Sister...
- <i>With the same genes</i>

162
00:10:30,606 --> 00:10:33,192
<i>A group of shared bodies and minds</i>

163
00:10:34,444 --> 00:10:38,698
<i>When the human body
ends its activities, it becomes dust and becomes the ground</i>

164
00:10:39,432 --> 00:10:43,577
<i>And we
will drink the dust and tread on the ground</i>

165
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:46,163
<i>Living, dying, and being born again</i>

166
00:10:46,164 --> 00:10:48,138
<i>Keeps turning and turning</i>

167
00:10:48,163 --> 00:10:49,624
<i>Well, in a word</i>

168
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:54,047
<i>This soil and land connect and circulate everything </i>

169
00:10:54,505 --> 00:10:58,217
<i> Fuck all the ‘superstitions and frauds’ .</i>

170
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:02,617
<i>For the top 1% in Korea,
Feng Shui is both a religion and a science</i>

<i>This is Hoan Kim Sang-deok, a geomancy master</i>

174

the current economic situation</i>

175
00:11:18,321 --> 00:11:22,449
<i> Survey results show that it is perceived as a long-term recession </i>

176
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,868
<i>According to the survey, Korea's...</i>

177
00:11:23,911 --> 00:11:26,037
Oh, eat it when it’s done!

178
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:28,972
No, just
wait until it ripens.

179
00:11:28,997 --> 00:11:30,817
All you have to do is ‘get it’ once.

180
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:33,001
Honestly, there today.

181
00:11:33,002 --> 00:11:34,419
there...

182
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,837
Is it a famous place?

183
00:11:35,838 --> 00:11:37,756
Uh-huh, this person...

184
00:11:37,757 --> 00:11:40,017
What are you talking about?
I'm still a regular...

185
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:42,470
No, I saw that grave earlier.

186
00:11:42,563 --> 00:11:45,055
Well, Hyeonmu is also a bit ambiguous.

187
00:11:45,056 --> 00:11:48,684
Well, it looks like a tiger...
I'm not sure...

188
00:11:48,685 --> 00:11:51,479
Okay, this anti-feng shui is done.

189
00:11:51,571 --> 00:11:53,314
No,
if you think you know that well

190
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:55,316
Hey, do it alone now

191
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,193
No, so I
thought about it.

192
00:11:57,294 --> 00:12:01,405
Are you saying that an average of 250,000 people die in Korea every year ?

193
00:12:01,406 --> 00:12:03,408
Of these, 30%
have stores.

194
00:12:03,474 --> 00:12:07,536
Then, since the Joseon Dynasty,
this narrow land

195
00:12:07,537 --> 00:12:10,455
They wouldn't have buried so many people in every good place.

196
00:12:10,456 --> 00:12:14,961
But the fact that the famous place
is still popular...

197
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,422
- I like this...
- Just...

198
00:12:18,214 --> 00:12:20,258
It's 65 points, that's it

199
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,246
Yeah, yeah,
not 100 points.

200
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:24,804
Now the seeds have dried up and
are no longer there

201
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:28,015
Look at
these idiots like you, huh?

202
00:12:28,016 --> 00:12:30,058
They are all sold to mutual aid companies.

203
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:32,894
huh?
All these idiots who live off the ground like us.

204
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,813
- They're all snooping around construction sites
- Ugh...

205
00:12:34,814 --> 00:12:36,441
This is the end, huh?

206
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,525
last standing

207
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:40,694
- One wreck
- Baby, stay still.

208
00:12:40,695 --> 00:12:41,987
You arrived quickly?

209
00:12:41,988 --> 00:12:43,697
Oh my, you came early?

210
00:12:43,698 --> 00:12:45,073
- Oh my, it's been a long time
- Oh my.

211
00:12:45,074 --> 00:12:46,325
- Hello
- Oh, yes.

212
00:12:46,326 --> 00:12:47,326
- Hey, wow
- Yes.

213
00:12:47,327 --> 00:12:48,578
oh my

214
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:51,038
- Oh my
- the smell of bunches reaches all the way to Seoul.

215
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:53,165
- You have to be able to hold it in
- Songi ate it all.

216
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,043
What are you talking about, haha

217
00:12:55,102 --> 00:12:56,752
- How have you been?
- Hey, welcome back.

218
00:12:56,753 --> 00:12:58,170
I should have contacted you more often.

219
00:12:58,171 --> 00:12:59,796
Oh well,
there's nothing you can do if you're busy.

220
00:12:59,797 --> 00:13:00,881
however

221
00:13:00,882 --> 00:13:02,507
Bonggil has become prettier

222
00:13:02,508 --> 00:13:03,550
Uh, really?

223
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:05,010
Hey, don't even say anything.

224
00:13:05,011 --> 00:13:07,012
They say the sisters
take each other with them...

225
00:13:07,013 --> 00:13:08,388
- Be spoiled
- yay

226
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:10,015
How long has it been like this, huh?

227
00:13:10,016 --> 00:13:11,975
- Has it been three years?
- yes

228
00:13:11,976 --> 00:13:13,185
Time flies so fast

229
00:13:13,186 --> 00:13:14,437
Write, how...

230
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,229
How is business these days?

231
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,982
Well, it's just like that.

232
00:13:18,036 --> 00:13:20,693
- Well, it's the off-season, so...
- Ah, so I...

233
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:23,362
- Again, our elders...
- Just stay still.

234
00:13:23,363 --> 00:13:24,447
This is something... sniff

235
00:13:24,496 --> 00:13:27,491
Sniff, I think it smells?
Can't you smell something?

236
00:13:27,492 --> 00:13:28,950
What smell?

237
00:13:28,951 --> 00:13:30,078
What is that smell?

238
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,580
- Oh, I think it smells like this?
- ha ha ha

239
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,665
Ic... Tsk.

240
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,918
I hid it so I could hide it...

241
00:13:37,835 --> 00:13:38,835
It caught me right away

242
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,881
- Hey, solve it, what is it?
- It's stuck, it's stuck.

243
00:13:42,882 --> 00:13:45,968
- Hey, be quick to notice.
- There will be a mark, then.

244
00:13:51,662 --> 00:13:53,433
<i>Introduction to a close doctor</i>

245
00:13:53,434 --> 00:13:56,913
<i> I went to America with a strange family?</i>

246
00:13:56,938 --> 00:13:58,855
<i>Park Ji-yong...</i>

247
00:13:58,856 --> 00:14:01,441
<i>Even my father
is Korean</i>

248
00:14:01,442 --> 00:14:04,054
<i>The client
is of American nationality</i>

249
00:14:04,237 --> 00:14:05,612
There is no bottom or end
, it's just...

250
00:14:05,613 --> 00:14:07,281
He's rich, very rich.

251
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,992
Good start, huh?

252
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:12,703
My eldest grandchildren suffered from ghost disease.

253
00:14:12,704 --> 00:14:13,787
Even a newborn baby

254
00:14:13,788 --> 00:14:15,414
Oh my...

255
00:14:15,415 --> 00:14:17,333
It lasted quite a long time

256
00:14:18,001 --> 00:14:19,376
Isn't it possession?

257
00:14:19,377 --> 00:14:21,753
It's not that far yet
...

258
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:24,214
Just looked at it...

259
00:14:24,215 --> 00:14:27,093
It's a cold wind...

260
00:15:02,054 --> 00:15:03,138
first of all

261
00:15:03,163 --> 00:15:05,506
I can't trust those people.

262
00:15:06,132 --> 00:15:08,593
If you do it wrong, things will get worse.

263
00:15:08,968 --> 00:15:11,244
The baby will be fine soon.

264
00:15:12,847 --> 00:15:14,931
we pray together

265
00:15:15,398 --> 00:15:17,542
Treat again

266
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:31,031
we just

267
00:15:31,032 --> 00:15:34,577
All you have to do is live quietly from afar .

268
00:15:54,472 --> 00:15:57,849
Oh my,
how about showing some belly at the wedding?

269
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,518
Ah, what better
coma than that?

270
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,853
Oh, that's still true.
What is a grandchild? A grandchild?

271
00:16:01,854 --> 00:16:03,605
Plus,
with this yellow hair...

272
00:16:03,606 --> 00:16:06,108
Oh, aren't these headlights blue?

273
00:16:06,109 --> 00:16:07,609
It's really tacky...

274
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,529
Oh, so Yeonhee
will continue to live in Germany once she gets married?

275
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:13,783
What does this person mean?
Of course I should live in Korea, tsk.

276
00:16:13,924 --> 00:16:15,493
Hey, by the way

277
00:16:15,702 --> 00:16:20,163
I was a little worried about money because Yeonhee is getting married.

278
00:16:20,164 --> 00:16:22,874
- But you still got one big thing?
- That's right.

279
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,501
Hey, our Lord

280
00:16:24,502 --> 00:16:29,090
Well, when the time comes,
they even provide severance pay like this.

281
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,154
amen!

282
00:16:31,756 --> 00:16:34,470
No, but how rich is this guy , huh?

283
00:16:34,614 --> 00:16:37,223
Are you giving me 500 million won for the relocation ?

284
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:39,474
Would you have given that to me?
I guess they gave me more

285
00:16:39,475 --> 00:16:40,684
uh? more?

286
00:16:40,685 --> 00:16:44,187
Hwarim , what kind of a bitch is she?

287
00:16:44,188 --> 00:16:45,815
You couldn't have eaten any more, right?

288
00:16:45,867 --> 00:16:47,400
Yeah, uh

289
00:16:47,469 --> 00:16:49,818
The bright blue thing is just
annoying

290
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:50,987
uh

291
00:16:55,831 --> 00:17:00,054
First of all, please honor my grandfather and
tell me about his hometown first.

292
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,455
I originally...

293
00:17:01,456 --> 00:17:06,168
I am a person who researches the reputations of the people in this family and
even their jobs.

294
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:08,459
Since you said it was urgent
, well...

295
00:17:08,546 --> 00:17:10,464
than the person receiving the money

296
00:17:10,465 --> 00:17:13,299
Doesn’t the giver
need more trust?

297
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:17,889
ah...

298
00:17:18,264 --> 00:17:19,891
trust?

299
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,851
Well, let's do it, okay?

300
00:17:21,982 --> 00:17:25,063
If you don't feel like it,
just pretend it never happened.

301
00:17:25,088 --> 00:17:27,478
Could you please keep two things in mind?

302
00:17:28,149 --> 00:17:30,860
Please keep everything
a secret today.

303
00:17:31,235 --> 00:17:33,905
And please apply makeup right away.

304
00:17:35,365 --> 00:17:36,407
With a government office

305
00:17:38,128 --> 00:17:39,327
With government bonds?

306
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:41,204
So what, don’t even open the opening?

307
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:43,456
Well, does it matter?

308
00:17:44,207 --> 00:17:46,020
Either move it somewhere else anyway

309
00:17:46,045 --> 00:17:47,834
Well, I heard you were doing makeup
?

310
00:17:47,835 --> 00:17:49,527
This is it

311
00:17:49,837 --> 00:17:53,076
This usually
has to be reported to the district office first...

312
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:56,885
After the opening,
the undertaker collects the remains,

313
00:17:56,886 --> 00:18:00,698
Then
you have to move to another location or apply makeup.

314
00:18:00,723 --> 00:18:01,849
yes?

315
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,795
Tsk, well, first of all...

316
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:09,983
Let’s look at the place first.

317
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,233
So do my parents

318
00:18:11,234 --> 00:18:13,361
My relatives are quite against it.

319
00:18:13,457 --> 00:18:16,739
- So, as quickly as possible...
- Let's take a look at the grave site first.

320
00:18:22,424 --> 00:18:24,831
It's in the north of Gangwon-do...

321
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,125
Ha... why am I anxious?

322
00:18:27,185 --> 00:18:29,376
Ah, but I'm
telling you not to open the coffin.

323
00:18:29,377 --> 00:18:31,378
That's a little strange

324
00:18:31,379 --> 00:18:34,257
Oh, shouldn't we check the remains ?

325
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:36,134
So
you're saying you don't even salt it?

326
00:18:38,594 --> 00:18:41,222
What 's in the coffin ?

327
00:20:30,498 --> 00:20:33,126
Have you ever seen a tomb at the top of a mountain?

328
00:20:33,418 --> 00:20:34,711
It's rare

329
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,167
Do you know this mountain here?

330
00:20:38,293 --> 00:20:40,216
It's my first time here.

331
00:20:40,842 --> 00:20:43,803
A person who knows all eight provinces and mountains

332
00:20:43,847 --> 00:20:45,094
Are there places you don’t know about?

333
00:20:46,249 --> 00:20:48,683
I only look for famous places

334
00:21:50,362 --> 00:21:51,613
and...

335
00:21:51,638 --> 00:21:53,747
The dragon is spread out

336
00:21:53,748 --> 00:21:54,956
good night

337
00:21:54,957 --> 00:21:56,876
Can you see North Korea over there?

338
00:21:56,901 --> 00:21:58,640
uh? I can also see North Korea

339
00:22:00,697 --> 00:22:01,697
uh...

340
00:22:03,143 --> 00:22:05,510
The tomb is very simple compared to the location.

341
00:22:05,572 --> 00:22:06,469
huh?

342
00:22:38,084 --> 00:22:39,377
What do you have?

343
00:22:41,838 --> 00:22:43,297
You don't have a name?

344
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,022
Can you tell me who recognized this tomb ?

345
00:22:59,534 --> 00:23:01,398
A famous monk at the time

346
00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:03,943
My grandfather
made great contributions to the country.

347
00:23:04,944 --> 00:23:07,404
My father said he found the best spot for me...

348
00:23:07,405 --> 00:23:08,989
Are you a monk?

349
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:09,907
yes

350
00:23:09,908 --> 00:23:12,452
I heard that there is a monk whose Buddhist name is ‘Gisune’.

351
00:23:12,702 --> 00:23:14,203
Are you a jockey?

352
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:16,581
The name of the law is very unique.

353
00:23:17,081 --> 00:23:20,685
For something like that,
the tomb is a bit simple, right?

354
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,878
At that time, there was a lot of robbery...

355
00:23:22,879 --> 00:23:25,423
So I heard that they served quietly and simply.

356
00:23:35,725 --> 00:23:37,185
How are you feeling?

357
00:23:37,602 --> 00:23:39,437
Well, I'll catch you right away, okay?

358
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,609
why? What's strange?

359
00:23:49,781 --> 00:23:51,199
president

360
00:23:51,658 --> 00:23:55,119
I don't think I can do this job

361
00:23:57,955 --> 00:24:00,290
I got a pout again, Mr...

362
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:01,459
older brother!

363
00:24:02,418 --> 00:24:04,337
- It's arbitrary, tsk
- What is it?

364
00:24:04,837 --> 00:24:06,464
Don’t you like it very much?

365
00:24:07,131 --> 00:24:09,550
Is there any way?

366
00:24:11,052 --> 00:24:12,929
Why aren't you talking?

367
00:24:15,264 --> 00:24:16,640
no...

368
00:24:17,016 --> 00:24:20,355
The pickling here is fine and
fine, but why? why?

369
00:24:20,645 --> 00:24:23,605
Oh, how much does this cost? I really...

370
00:24:24,584 --> 00:24:25,357
no, sir

371
00:24:25,358 --> 00:24:27,485
Why are you doing that, yes?

372
00:24:30,029 --> 00:24:32,155
You know everything here

373
00:24:32,156 --> 00:24:34,701
What happens if you touch a grave by mistake?

374
00:24:35,118 --> 00:24:37,661
I lived off the land for 40 years

375
00:24:37,662 --> 00:24:40,080
This is an unheard of secret place.

376
00:24:40,081 --> 00:24:41,416
This place is really evil

377
00:24:42,417 --> 00:24:44,084
A den like this...

378
00:24:44,085 --> 00:24:46,795
It's definitely not a place for people to lie down.

379
00:24:46,796 --> 00:24:49,548
If you touch something wrong like that,

380
00:24:49,549 --> 00:24:53,719
Everyone , from the branch office to the workers,
are lined up for a portrait. I, these people.

381
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,179
Talk about what you know

382
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:57,473
Hwarim, did you see it?
foxes

383
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,563
A fox and a cat are polar opposites.
This doesn't make sense.

384
00:25:05,336 --> 00:25:07,775
It is the worst of evils.

385
00:25:17,785 --> 00:25:21,372
That was the last time I saw my son's smiling face .

386
00:25:22,248 --> 00:25:23,290
actually...

387
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:25,208
There were two more children in front.

388
00:25:25,209 --> 00:25:27,377
For unknown reasons, they all miscarried.

389
00:25:27,378 --> 00:25:29,589
I am a son who was acquired through hard work at a late age.

390
00:25:31,341 --> 00:25:33,843
Does Mr. Kim
have any children?

391
00:25:33,935 --> 00:25:36,011
Yes, there is

392
00:25:36,012 --> 00:25:38,806
I have a daughter who will be getting married soon.

393
00:25:39,307 --> 00:25:40,642
Congratulations

394
00:25:40,933 --> 00:25:42,644
What is a celebration, hehe

395
00:25:42,702 --> 00:25:45,330
Oh, then does your daughter
do something similar?

396
00:25:45,355 --> 00:25:47,981
My daughter
majored in aerospace engineering at KAIST.

397
00:25:47,982 --> 00:25:50,818
I'm currently working for an airline company in Germany.

398
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:54,112
There's so much fuss about getting married now , oh my...

399
00:25:54,671 --> 00:25:55,815
It's fun

400
00:25:56,449 --> 00:25:58,569
My father is a feng shui practitioner.

401
00:25:58,593 --> 00:25:59,993
My daughter is in aerospace engineering...

402
00:25:59,994 --> 00:26:01,286
This is it

403
00:26:01,287 --> 00:26:04,623
If you just leave those two like this and
look at them,

404
00:26:04,624 --> 00:26:08,210
It's a field with a lot of similarities
, right?

405
00:26:08,211 --> 00:26:09,586
These five elements

406
00:26:09,587 --> 00:26:14,424
Originally based on earth
, water, fire, iron and wood

407
00:26:14,425 --> 00:26:17,469
Studying the essential requirements that make up nature

408
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,208
And this is space engineering, huh?

409
00:26:19,232 --> 00:26:20,181
then...

410
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,435
Please save my son

411
00:26:29,607 --> 00:26:32,103
Park Ji-yong , are you hiding something from us ?

412
00:26:35,244 --> 00:26:38,289
- What do you mean...
- Three eight three four one seven.

413
00:26:38,314 --> 00:26:40,492
One, two, eight, three, nineteen

414
00:26:40,493 --> 00:26:42,120
latitude and longitude

415
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:44,789
The numbers engraved on the back of the tombstone

416
00:26:45,081 --> 00:26:47,479
That monk called Gisune.

417
00:26:47,745 --> 00:26:50,169
I don't know who that guy is

418
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:51,920
It's eerily accurate.

419
00:26:51,921 --> 00:26:54,469
I can see a clear intention.

420
00:27:00,304 --> 00:27:01,723
no...

421
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,474
I do not know

422
00:27:04,767 --> 00:27:06,560
And I
'm not hiding anything from you two.

423
00:27:06,561 --> 00:27:09,021
Haha...
I'll say it again

424
00:27:09,022 --> 00:27:12,107
Moving to a place in such an unidentified evil place ?

425
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:13,901
This is really dangerous

426
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,132
It's the same thing as digging landmines with your bare hands.

427
00:27:16,156 --> 00:27:17,362
Let’s do a Daesalgut.

428
00:27:20,992 --> 00:27:22,334
I knew that

429
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:27,915
You do it with gut and village head at the same time.

430
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:31,002
Why are you like this?
I know the answer

431
00:27:31,461 --> 00:27:34,005
I don't believe in anything I haven't done

432
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,965
Although it is my first time doing this when moving ,

433
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,517
It's not theoretically impossible.

434
00:27:39,388 --> 00:27:40,553
No, wait a minute.

435
00:27:41,763 --> 00:27:43,757
why we now

436
00:27:43,781 --> 00:27:45,850
Are you getting permission from Mr. Kim?

437
00:27:46,017 --> 00:27:48,257
There is not just one Ji-gwan in Korea .

438
00:27:48,603 --> 00:27:50,976
This is why it's hard to work with old guys

439
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,438
hey

440
00:27:51,439 --> 00:27:53,694
No, the kid is sick.

441
00:27:53,718 --> 00:27:54,275
yes?

442
00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:04,994
This hotel has a good location.

443
00:28:06,914 --> 00:28:08,205
- Okay
- let's go!

444

446
00:28:17,507 --> 00:28:20,051
<i> Let those five people dig the grave</i>

447
00:28:20,635 --> 00:28:23,637
<i> Send the negative energy coming from the land to Daejeon</i>

Overview!

494
00:33:49,881 --> 00:33:51,465
Thank you for your hard work

495
00:33:51,466 --> 00:33:53,718
- Oh...
- Oh my...

496
00:33:57,716 --> 00:33:59,931
The chill is incredible.

497
00:34:15,865 --> 00:34:18,618
It's been so long
I can't recognize it.

498
00:34:33,883 --> 00:34:36,636
Hey... what is this...

499
00:34:36,792 --> 00:34:37,631
hey...

500
00:34:37,655 --> 00:34:39,179
There is a juniper coffin?

501
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,667
This
used to be used only in the royal family.

502
00:34:41,692 --> 00:34:43,067
Is there something like this here?

503
00:34:43,184 --> 00:34:44,184
uh?

504
00:34:46,354 --> 00:34:48,271
Adjutant!

505
00:34:51,317 --> 00:34:52,818
Uh, okay

506
00:34:52,819 --> 00:34:54,403
Okay, okay,
cheer up little by little

507
00:34:54,404 --> 00:34:55,529
Now, lower your preference!

508
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:57,803
- Slowly, slowly
- Lower it.

509
00:34:57,877 --> 00:35:00,242
Hey,
I'm just going to put the coffin on the hearse.

510
00:35:00,243 --> 00:35:01,989
We 'll go straight to the crematorium

511
00:35:02,014 --> 00:35:05,200
Bury me with that tombstone and
give me a good ending.

512
00:35:05,497 --> 00:35:07,538
Now let's change the straps, uh

513
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:09,200
And don't eat meat today

514
00:35:09,225 --> 00:35:11,295
- Yeah
- Oh, my chai.

515
00:35:16,259 --> 00:35:18,636
I'm using it well.

516
00:35:27,478 --> 00:35:28,563
yes

517
00:35:29,188 --> 00:35:31,816
There's a dead man
lying inside.

518
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,359
Let’s serve each other respectfully.

519
00:35:33,776 --> 00:35:35,778
Oh my, that's right

520
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:39,198
I am Go Young-geun, who wants to be president .

521
00:35:39,532 --> 00:35:42,330
Now that it's over, just
relax, okay?

522
00:35:42,452 --> 00:35:43,476
hmm

523
00:35:57,609 --> 00:35:58,851
see...

524
00:36:00,345 --> 00:36:01,678
There's nothing

525
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:02,972
let's go

526
00:36:12,696 --> 00:36:13,964
Hey, what is it?

527
00:36:14,096 --> 00:36:15,096
Seed...

528
00:37:02,615 --> 00:37:04,409
No, what's going on?

529
00:37:04,701 --> 00:37:07,036
Ha, my...

530
00:37:18,798 --> 00:37:21,509
- I'll talk to you
. - Then I'll call the warden.

531
00:37:25,555 --> 00:37:26,555
president

532
00:37:26,556 --> 00:37:28,958
It suddenly rained without any forecast

533
00:37:28,983 --> 00:37:31,269
I think I'll have to postpone my makeup for a bit.

534
00:37:32,478 --> 00:37:33,813
Why is that so?

535
00:37:33,991 --> 00:37:35,814
It's not like you're putting on makeup outside, right?

536
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:39,485
If you put on makeup on a rainy day like this ...

537
00:37:39,777 --> 00:37:42,755
The dead
can never go to a good place.

538
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,657
Well, you might think it's a superstition ...

539
00:37:45,658 --> 00:37:47,952
I'm talking about professional ethics.

540
00:37:50,092 --> 00:37:52,675
This happens
sometimes, yeah

541
00:37:52,916 --> 00:37:54,208
In times like this

542
00:37:54,346 --> 00:37:57,480
The remains were placed in the morgue of a nearby hospital.

543
00:37:57,505 --> 00:38:00,381
You can just apply makeup again on days when you don't have hands.

544
00:38:00,757 --> 00:38:04,344
If you go to the hospital , don't you have to file a funeral report ?

545
00:38:04,402 --> 00:38:05,636
<i>형님!</i>

546
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:07,764
Brother, I'm on the phone. It's okay.

547
00:38:07,897 --> 00:38:09,216
<i>Oh, you can go right away!</i>

548
00:38:09,336 --> 00:38:10,850
don't worry about that

549
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:12,560
Because we know everything

550
00:38:16,765 --> 00:38:19,471
No,
what does it mean to say that the coffin has been relocated and then brought back with the coffin?

551
00:38:19,496 --> 00:38:22,111
Hey,
I guess the owner of the store is preventing it from opening.

552
00:38:22,136 --> 00:38:25,555
- Hey, W
- Hey, that's enough, that's enough, uh

553
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,116
what the

554
00:38:27,284 --> 00:38:28,117
Oh, what's wrong?

555
00:38:28,142 --> 00:38:31,616
- Ah, here, ah, quickly
- Hey, it's me...

556
00:38:31,996 --> 00:38:35,072
The last team left today so it was quiet.

557
00:38:35,097 --> 00:38:36,709
Oh, great.

558
00:38:36,787 --> 00:38:39,462
Oh my,
it's raining on makeup day...

559
00:38:39,487 --> 00:38:42,416
It's hard to leave even once

560
00:38:50,853 --> 00:38:53,265
Do I have to set the date again?

561
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:53,893
yes

562
00:38:55,144 --> 00:38:57,855
But can you really trust those people ?

563
00:38:58,064 --> 00:39:00,858
I gave as much as I could
and said only what I had to say.

564
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:02,903
No need to worry

565
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,280
Now that I have time

566
00:39:06,864 --> 00:39:10,910
Let’s think about a way to quietly enshrine it at Yeoju Seonsan.

567
00:39:11,828 --> 00:39:14,872
I'm still against wearing makeup

568
00:39:15,581 --> 00:39:18,543
He is my father,
so I can decide.

569
00:39:20,253 --> 00:39:21,713
Get some rest first.

570
00:39:27,361 --> 00:39:29,654
I...
I can't give an overview.

571
00:39:29,773 --> 00:39:31,531
Let’s just leave the coffin open.

572
00:39:31,573 --> 00:39:34,350
I just have to set the humidity

573
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:35,640
Ah, thank you anyway

574
00:39:36,232 --> 00:39:38,276
Hey... the coffin...

575
00:39:39,272 --> 00:39:41,441
It looks like you held a government position?

576
00:39:42,567 --> 00:39:43,984
- no?
- Wow, it’s been a while.

577
00:39:43,985 --> 00:39:45,194
Ah, yeah, hehe

578
00:39:46,466 --> 00:39:49,073
Sangju and the bereaved family
all went up to Seoul.

579
00:39:49,955 --> 00:39:52,869
But Hwarim
is coming this way?

580
00:39:53,623 --> 00:39:55,454
I hope you will be happy this day too.

581
00:39:55,455 --> 00:39:57,874
I'm having a bowl of hot soup

582
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,585
I'll go somewhere and come back

583
00:40:01,419 --> 00:40:02,462
is it so

584
00:40:56,949 --> 00:41:00,019
This is my first time meeting you.
How...

585
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,688
Oh, sorry, sorry.

586
00:41:02,188 --> 00:41:06,317
I was passing by and
saw a sign on the road.

587
00:41:06,342 --> 00:41:08,337
Oh, I see.

588
00:41:08,846 --> 00:41:09,904
It's no different

589
00:41:09,983 --> 00:41:13,080
There is a feng shui sign on the sign of Boguksa Temple.

590
00:41:13,105 --> 00:41:15,570
I came here because I was a little curious.

591
00:41:17,561 --> 00:41:18,787
Are you a Ji-gwan?

592
00:41:18,788 --> 00:41:20,164
Haha, yeah

593
00:41:20,282 --> 00:41:23,334
I studied under teacher Choi Eui-jung in that building.

594
00:41:23,835 --> 00:41:27,755
Right now,
I am a person who is barely able to survive alone.

595
00:41:27,864 --> 00:41:29,975
Although this place
looks a little shabby

596
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,754
It is a place that has been in existence for over 100 years .

597
00:41:33,136 --> 00:41:36,638
The head monk who first built Boguksa Temple here

598
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:40,601
He was very good at feng shui and
made quite a name for himself.

599
00:41:40,626 --> 00:41:42,256
Ah... yes

600
00:41:42,434 --> 00:41:45,522
I think you can tell just by looking at this place.

601
00:41:45,523 --> 00:41:46,899
So, by the way...

602
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,861
Here is the name of the head monk

603
00:41:50,153 --> 00:41:51,779
Are you Gisu by any chance?

604
00:41:52,822 --> 00:41:54,115
Are you a jockey?

605
00:41:54,407 --> 00:41:56,576
No,
it's Monk Wonbong.

606
00:41:57,076 --> 00:41:59,578
But, why
are you asking?

607
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:00,747
ah...

608
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,500
Ah...
on top of that mountain over there

609
00:42:04,792 --> 00:42:07,045
There was a grave with no name.

610
00:42:07,141 --> 00:42:08,970
Just in case you know...

611
00:42:08,994 --> 00:42:10,048
Huh, sure

612
00:42:10,572 --> 00:42:12,699
Well,
I don't know if it still exists.

613
00:42:13,051 --> 00:42:16,710
I heard a lot of rumors a long time ago

614
00:42:18,598 --> 00:42:20,850
What... rumours?

615
00:42:20,922 --> 00:42:22,768
Don't be alone in the dark

616
00:42:22,769 --> 00:42:25,396
Go across and
have a bowl of beef stew.

617
00:42:25,494 --> 00:42:26,814
Yeah, okay,
don't worry.

618
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:29,001
- Okay, go
- Good job, okay, go in.

619
00:42:32,648 --> 00:42:35,615
Ha, why do you decide the menu , Mr.

620
00:42:43,206 --> 00:42:47,293
There was a rumor that there was treasure buried in that tomb.

621
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,419
Treasure?

622
00:42:51,279 --> 00:42:54,592
There was also talk that it was the tomb of the richest man in Joseon.

623
00:42:54,753 --> 00:42:57,428
There was also talk that it was a royal tomb that no one knew about.

624
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,808
So, in the past, there were quite a few grave robbers .

625
00:43:02,934 --> 00:43:04,185
Grave robbers?

626
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:06,771
Suddenly,
everyone is captured and...

627
00:43:06,867 --> 00:43:09,983
I heard there were people who crossed over to the North or something.

628
00:43:10,152 --> 00:43:12,384
So you ended up
not being able to rob?

629
00:43:12,477 --> 00:43:14,404
I didn't even try, I guess

630
00:43:14,501 --> 00:43:17,114
Perhaps because it is the tomb of a high-ranking person,
security is very tight.

631
00:43:17,115 --> 00:43:18,842
It was difficult to even approach.

632
00:43:20,576 --> 00:43:21,576
this...

633
00:43:21,577 --> 00:43:24,747
This is the equipment they left behind at that time .

634
00:43:31,922 --> 00:43:32,922
however

635
00:43:33,339 --> 00:43:35,341
Why do you ask about that grave?

636
00:43:39,887 --> 00:43:41,264
me today

637
00:43:41,806 --> 00:43:43,808
I dug that grave

638
00:43:51,024 --> 00:43:52,233
how

639
00:43:52,817 --> 00:43:54,736
Was there any gold or silver treasure?

640
00:44:10,943 --> 00:44:11,669
hey?

641
00:44:11,723 --> 00:44:13,295
- eww!
- What are you doing?

642
00:44:13,296 --> 00:44:14,671
hey!

643
00:44:20,834 --> 00:44:21,845
teacher

644
00:44:21,846 --> 00:44:22,930
teacher!

645
00:44:23,306 --> 00:44:24,182
hey!

646
00:44:24,183 --> 00:44:25,641
teacher

647
00:44:25,642 --> 00:44:27,435
Teacher, are you okay?

648
00:44:31,105 --> 00:44:32,230
what?

649
00:44:32,231 --> 00:44:33,357
Oh, what does that mean?

650
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:34,817
The coffin was opened?

651
00:44:36,168 --> 00:44:38,165
Hey, I'm shaking my hands...

652
00:44:38,245 --> 00:44:40,163
If you've given enough,
you shouldn't do that, Mr.

653
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:41,949
For some reason, his eyes were dull

654
00:44:44,327 --> 00:44:45,244
uh

655
00:44:45,245 --> 00:44:46,663
What happened?

656
00:44:47,997 --> 00:44:49,964
Something
passed by the teacher

657
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:52,335
Well, what's going on?

658
00:45:02,345 --> 00:45:04,514
What came out there?

659
00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:06,557
It's so fucking rough

660
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:48,349
father...

661
00:45:50,018 --> 00:45:54,230
My father...

662
00:45:58,234 --> 00:46:00,111
<i>종순아</i>

663
00:46:01,195 --> 00:46:03,364
<i>My baby</i>

664
00:46:04,991 --> 00:46:07,660
<i>Please open the door</i>

665
00:46:08,619 --> 00:46:11,497
father...

666
00:46:13,401 --> 00:46:16,836
Please come in

667
00:46:44,204 --> 00:46:46,991
Uh... father...

668
00:47:23,133 --> 00:47:28,741
Our small and intelligent
puppy...

669
00:47:30,507 --> 00:47:35,164
This
place flows with milk and honey...

670
00:47:36,624 --> 00:47:42,672
Your father is cold and hungry...

671
00:47:42,724 --> 00:47:45,425
sorry...

672
00:48:48,821 --> 00:48:51,823
<i>Your soul
is probably running around like crazy right now</i>

673
00:48:51,824 --> 00:48:53,742
<i>Sangju will be dangerous</i>

674
00:48:53,743 --> 00:48:57,121
<i>Teacher, please
go to Seoul first</i>

675
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:00,290
<i>In the meantime, we
'll bring the soul back here</i>

676
00:49:00,291 --> 00:49:03,018
No, you're calling me here right now ?

677
00:49:03,043 --> 00:49:05,457
I screamed like that under him for 100 years.

678
00:49:05,546 --> 00:49:07,590
No one took it out

679
00:49:08,049 --> 00:49:09,801
Only hatred remains in my soul

680
00:49:10,677 --> 00:49:13,929
I'm going to find all my blood ties.

681
00:49:21,409 --> 00:49:23,356
Oh my, you're killing the mood, Mr...

682
00:49:23,463 --> 00:49:25,942
It's raining outside,
the coffin lid opens, and a ghost comes out.

683
00:49:26,089 --> 00:49:27,777
I really
don't want to do this, man...

684
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,380
What's going on with me
? This is so...

685
00:49:33,116 --> 00:49:36,327
Do you think it would be okay to do the exorcism and this as well as
two soups a day?

686
00:49:36,577 --> 00:49:38,329
it's okay

687
00:49:39,414 --> 00:49:41,582
Elder Ko, you
need to get your timing right.

688
00:49:41,791 --> 00:49:43,352
You have to hold on to it as soon as you come in.

689
00:49:57,981 --> 00:50:01,226
Sabah World Namseon Buju

690

Gangwon Dora Twenty-six Building

692
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:11,486
I captured the county and called it Goseong-gun.

693
00:50:11,487 --> 00:50:15,032
Grab the noodles and make them Jukwangmyeon.

694
00:50:15,033 --> 00:50:18,243
Park family, Kwon clan, Yongjeong

695
00:50:18,244 --> 00:50:20,954
When we pick up the dead today

696
00:50:20,955 --> 00:50:23,665
Cho Dangogwi Lee Dancheongeun

697
00:50:23,666 --> 00:50:27,461
Come back to the three-tiered room.

698
00:50:27,462 --> 00:50:30,590
Come back to the reflection room.

699
00:50:30,798 --> 00:50:34,344
Come back to the anti-government room.

700
00:50:36,179 --> 00:50:38,348
Hehe,
come, come, come

701
00:50:40,892 --> 00:50:43,560
Chunsu chooses everything.

702
00:50:43,561 --> 00:50:46,855
Is it impossible to come in because the water is deep?

703
00:50:46,856 --> 00:50:49,358
Saying hello to the sick

704
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:52,569
Am I sick and can’t come?

705
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:53,321
On horseback...

706
00:51:01,871 --> 00:51:05,332
If you can't come because you don't have any clothes,
please bring back your resident uniform.

707
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:08,043
If you can't come because you don't have a bar,
please come back with a listing bar.

708
00:51:08,044 --> 00:51:11,963
If you can't come because you don't have shoes,
please come back wearing Sangju straw shoes.

709
00:51:11,964 --> 00:51:14,216
- If you can't come because you're thirsty
- hehe

710
00:51:14,217 --> 00:51:16,176
Come back for three drinks

711
00:51:16,177 --> 00:51:18,929
If you can't come because you don't have a home,
come back to Shintae's house.

712
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:23,100
If you can't come because you're in a bad state,
you can get lost in Chobaekri.

713
00:51:23,101 --> 00:51:25,060
- If you can't come because you don't know what to say
- Okay, everyone is here.

714
00:51:25,061 --> 00:51:26,020
- I'm begging for help
- Hey!

715
00:51:26,021 --> 00:51:27,604
Please come back at least for a moment

716
00:51:27,605 --> 00:51:30,273
- Thinking about ancient times
- Hey!

717
00:51:30,274 --> 00:51:33,986
Gong Do-ran has gray hair, and
what he cannot avoid is death.

718
00:51:33,987 --> 00:51:36,279
Load it!

719
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,242
Yes, he's coming, he's coming

720
00:51:43,131 --> 00:51:44,496
Yes, it's loaded! It was published

721
00:51:44,497 --> 00:51:46,917
Bonggil!

722
00:51:47,011 --> 00:51:48,334
Take it!

723
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:25,330
Grandfather

724
00:52:26,622 --> 00:52:28,124
Who is there?

725
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:30,251
yes?

726
00:52:31,711 --> 00:52:32,711
Bonggil, don’t let go!

727
00:52:35,907 --> 00:52:37,216
oh my...

728
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:39,719
What were you so upset about?

729
00:52:40,158 --> 00:52:41,766
Try speaking

730
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,086
- yes?
- Seed...

731
00:52:43,111 --> 00:52:45,280
Unpack everything here today and leave.

732
00:52:46,267 --> 00:52:48,853
Don't go anywhere else

733
00:52:49,979 --> 00:52:52,023
My babies...

734
00:52:52,732 --> 00:52:54,607
Take me with you

735
00:52:57,698 --> 00:52:58,946
That won't work

736
00:53:27,107 --> 00:53:28,107
I missed it

737
00:53:28,851 --> 00:53:30,144
What do we do?

738
00:53:37,826 --> 00:53:38,842
Yes, hello?

739
00:53:39,435 --> 00:53:41,085
<i>Ah, this is Kim Sang-deok,
boss</i>

740
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:42,477
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

741
00:53:43,366 --> 00:53:44,367
yes

742
00:53:44,617 --> 00:53:46,077
What's going on?

743
00:53:46,224 --> 00:53:47,786
<i>Oh, that's a relief</i>

744
00:53:47,787 --> 00:53:50,206
<i>No, that's because
something happened to me...</i>

745
00:53:50,231 --> 00:53:52,824
<i>I'm
heading there in a bit of a hurry right now</i>

746
00:53:52,849 --> 00:53:54,959
<i>It's a little late, but
can I talk to you for a moment?</i>

747
00:53:54,984 --> 00:53:55,984
yes

748
00:53:56,754 --> 00:53:58,256
What's going on?

749
00:53:59,161 --> 00:54:02,296
<i>Park Ji-yong,
you are staying at the same hotel you were at before, right?</i>

750
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,048
<i>Yes, I'm almost there?</i>

751
00:54:04,073 --> 00:54:06,019
<i>I'll be up soon</i>

752
00:54:06,044 --> 00:54:07,126
wait a minute

753
00:54:07,733 --> 00:54:08,808
who are you?

754
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,511
<i>Yes, I
am Sangdeok Kim</i>

755
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:12,063
<i>어?</i>

756
00:54:12,185 --> 00:54:13,396
<i>Hello?</i>

757
00:54:13,466 --> 00:54:15,076
<i>What is it? What is it?</i>

758
00:54:15,817 --> 00:54:17,488
Mr. Kim,
are you outside right now?

759
00:54:18,095 --> 00:54:19,540
<i>Hey, boss</i>

760
00:54:19,565 --> 00:54:21,911
<i>Ah, no,
no! No, no</i>

761
00:54:21,936 --> 00:54:23,204
<i>That's not me</i>

762
00:54:23,229 --> 00:54:25,211
<i>
That's because my grandfather's coffin is open now</i>

763
00:54:25,236 --> 00:54:26,418
<i>Hey, Jiyong Park</i>

764
00:54:26,634 --> 00:54:28,311
<i>I have urgent business
to attend to, please open the door!</i>

765
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:30,440
- Um, um, my grandfather's coffin?
- <i>Ah, yes...</i>

766
00:54:30,465 --> 00:54:32,263
<i>I'm sorry, but
things turned out that way</i>

767
00:54:32,288 --> 00:54:34,042
<i>What's going on inside?</i>

768
00:54:34,067 --> 00:54:35,163
<i>So</i>

769
00:54:35,343 --> 00:54:37,592
<i>Never! Don't open that door and stay still</i>

770
00:54:37,672 --> 00:54:39,296
<i>- I'm almost there now
- Jiyong Park!</i>

771
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:40,890
<i>From now</i>

772
00:54:40,915 --> 00:54:42,475
<i>Just listen to what I say and
act calmly</i>

773
00:54:44,121 --> 00:54:45,952
<i>Jiyong Park, listen carefully</i>

774
00:54:45,977 --> 00:54:49,265
<i>Stay away from the door now and
avoid towards the window</i>

775
00:54:51,476 --> 00:54:52,817
<i>First,
open the door</i>

776
00:54:53,555 --> 00:54:55,904
<i>First of all, the situation is urgent so
I need to explain it quickly, boss!</i>

777
00:54:55,977 --> 00:54:57,182
<i>Don't even answer</i>

778
00:54:57,207 --> 00:54:58,653
<i>- Don't even listen
- Oh, open the door quickly</i>

779
00:54:58,678 --> 00:55:01,124
<i>First go to the window and
open it</i>

780
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,976
<i>Grandpa will protect you </i>

781
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:04,364
<i>You have to take care of your grandfather</i>

782
00:55:04,404 --> 00:55:06,170
<i>Hey, boss!</i>

783
00:55:06,277 --> 00:55:07,616
<i>Trust me, quickly</i>

784
00:55:12,003 --> 00:55:14,374
<i>Open the door!</i>

785
00:55:54,389 --> 00:55:55,498
Jiyong Park

786
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:02,005
Jiyong Park

787
00:56:07,969 --> 00:56:08,969
are you okay?

788
00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:18,646
Good luck
to the youth of the peninsula!

789
00:56:19,397 --> 00:56:23,359
Can you hear the sound of hundreds of planes and cannons?

790
00:56:24,027 --> 00:56:26,446
Go forward,
sons of the empire!

791
00:56:27,732 --> 00:56:31,784
Raise your silver gun and sword in the shining sunlight of the rising sun !

792
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:35,032
For the new unification of Greater East Asia

793
00:56:35,621 --> 00:56:37,466
your whole body

794
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:39,792
Offer it to the great empire!

795
00:56:51,804 --> 00:56:52,847
ambulance...

796
00:56:53,181 --> 00:56:54,807
Call an ambulance

797
00:56:55,308 --> 00:56:57,185
Please call an ambulance

798
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:58,210
yes?

799
00:56:58,603 --> 00:57:00,229
Call an ambulance!

800
00:57:06,092 --> 00:57:08,614
Well,
I saw it clearly with my own two eyes.

801
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:10,746
If you leave this alone,
it's all a disaster.

802
00:57:10,771 --> 00:57:11,904
I'm going to that crematorium.

803
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:12,929
<i>Okay, let's go</i>

804
00:57:12,954 --> 00:57:14,999
Oh, and my brother gets permission to wear makeup.

805
00:57:15,024 --> 00:57:16,362
I 'll be waiting there

806
00:57:36,307 --> 00:57:37,684
now...

807
00:57:38,226 --> 00:57:40,812
- Grandfather's coffin was opened
- The fox cut off the tiger's waist.

808
00:57:42,714 --> 00:57:43,714
yes?

809
00:57:50,446 --> 00:57:53,539
{\an8}The fox cut off the tiger's waist.

810
00:58:06,846 --> 00:58:09,465
The fox
cut off the tiger's waist

811
00:58:36,974 --> 00:58:37,974
mother in law

812
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,204
Ah...
are you uncomfortable, where are you?

813
00:58:41,289 --> 00:58:43,916
I guess you're tired after visiting the countryside.

814
00:58:45,168 --> 00:58:47,211
I need to get some rest...

815
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:56,534
{\an8}The kid looks good today

816
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:00,620
{\an8}I can't contact you at home, so
I'm going to visit for a moment.

817
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,527
{\an8}Okay,
I'll be by your side.

818
00:59:08,608 --> 00:59:10,531
Ah, you man!
I'm not doing this because I'm in a hurry.

819
00:59:10,556 --> 00:59:11,823
When
did I ask for this?

820
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:13,211
<i>No, bro,
not now</i>

821
00:59:13,236 --> 00:59:15,861
Oh,
I'll be there soon, so hurry up, okay?

822
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:18,234
<i>Oh, and
it's raining like this, what kind of makeup do you need?</i>

823
00:59:18,259 --> 00:59:19,228
<i>What does Sangju say?</i>

824
00:59:19,253 --> 00:59:21,454
What
came out of the coffin, man!

825
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:23,331
You know what I mean?

826
00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:25,458
You need to put on makeup right away.

827
00:59:26,112 --> 00:59:27,919
Please call America quickly.

828
00:59:28,045 --> 00:59:29,045
yes?

829
00:59:29,435 --> 00:59:30,429
What are you saying?

830
00:59:30,454 --> 00:59:31,832
You saw it now

831
00:59:31,857 --> 00:59:33,953
Next time, the child is in danger?

832
01:00:01,258 --> 01:00:03,871
I don't answer calls home in the US.

833
01:00:05,373 --> 01:00:06,874
Ha, then...

834
01:00:26,602 --> 01:00:27,670
What is this?

835
01:00:27,695 --> 01:00:29,802
You said you moved, but
you didn't even prepare it?

836
01:00:30,189 --> 01:00:31,858
Are you going to burn this whole coffin?

837
01:00:32,942 --> 01:00:36,029
Oh my,
there will be an uproar if the district office finds out about this.

838
01:00:41,178 --> 01:00:42,408
Your father’s coffin?

839
01:00:42,433 --> 01:00:44,592
Yeah, I
don't understand either.

840
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:46,956
Anyway, I need to put on makeup quickly .

841
01:00:47,373 --> 01:00:48,624
What does that mean?

842
01:00:49,463 --> 01:00:50,601
Yes, aunt

843
01:00:50,751 --> 01:00:52,086
You have to hurry.

844
01:00:52,378 --> 01:00:53,880
<i>To an American child...</i>

01:01:18,135 --> 01:01:19,750
- Burn it.
- No, wait.

847
01:01:19,775 --> 01:01:21,794
The store manager
hasn't answered yet, wait a minute.

848

<i>
I can't contact you in the US either</i>

849
01:01:24,171 --> 01:01:27,688
<i>So, you need to allow your aunt
to be cremated</i>

850
01:01:48,309 --> 01:01:51,144
Is that really the only way?

851
01:02:09,076 --> 01:02:10,159
All right

852
01:02:10,832 --> 01:02:12,250
<i>Put on makeup</i>

853
01:02:12,275 --> 01:02:13,405

01:02:42,196 --> 01:02:44,240

<i>Brother, let’s visit when you have time , okay?</i>

862

<i>Turn left in a moment</i>

863

<i>Even the hospital doesn’t know</i>

01:04:53,853 --> 01:04:56,509
<i>Ugh... just do the inspection and spend money</i>

865
01:04:57,670 --> 01:04:59,130
Ha, dreams are difficult too...

866
01:05:00,251 --> 01:05:02,045
I see things in vain...

867

The snake...

873
01:05:20,956 --> 01:05:22,290
What, snake?

874
01:05:22,315 --> 01:05:25,735
Hmm... I should just leave it alone...

Please find that half-cut snake and
give me some healing.

<i>Why is there a tomb there?</i>

883
01:07:34,656 --> 01:07:36,074
It's a booklet

884
01:07:36,699 --> 01:07:38,868
Yes... I'm busy right now

885
01:07:38,966 --> 01:07:40,662
I'm currently studying the Bible with people from church.

886

889
01:07:44,248 --> 01:07:45,249
yes?

890
01:07:47,877 --> 01:07:48,877
A booklet?

891
01:07:48,902 --> 01:07:51,154
Yeah,
it's right below that.

892
01:07:51,748 --> 01:07:53,109
But Elder Go

893
01:07:53,549 --> 01:07:56,344
Have you ever seen a coffin standing upright ?

894
01:08:00,292 --> 01:08:01,307
yes

895
01:08:03,309 --> 01:08:04,727
Are you Teacher Hwarim?

896
01:08:05,478 --> 01:08:07,604
Now, V-Up

897
01:08:07,605 --> 01:08:09,148
Now, two beats

898
01:08:22,745 --> 01:08:26,891
When the ground is distorted,
the coffin sometimes stands vertically...

899
01:08:26,999 --> 01:08:28,584
Hey...

900
01:08:28,675 --> 01:08:30,461
Is this too big?

901
01:08:31,587 --> 01:08:33,172
what's this?

902
01:08:38,678 --> 01:08:40,554
What is that again...

903
01:08:49,362 --> 01:08:50,362
this...

904
01:08:51,733 --> 01:08:54,277
I think they made it impossible to open it from the outside
...

905
01:08:55,653 --> 01:08:57,530
- Or...
- Or, what?

906
01:08:57,905 --> 01:08:58,948
It would be the opposite.

907
01:09:02,726 --> 01:09:04,358
No, just
take it out and take a look.

908
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,740
take out something

909
01:09:05,953 --> 01:09:08,415
It's right to let the store manager know first.

910
01:09:08,416 --> 01:09:10,065
We
still have money to talk about.

911
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:11,168
we...

912
01:09:12,012 --> 01:09:13,504
Don't touch this

913
01:09:18,447 --> 01:09:19,447
Let's get it out first

914
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:22,247
Ha, it must be someone from the family.

915
01:09:22,272 --> 01:09:25,003
I can't just leave this guy here like this.

916
01:09:26,184 --> 01:09:28,394
This...
this, uh...

917
01:09:28,419 --> 01:09:30,094
Hey, let's just pull this out.
Go get the rope.

918
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:31,381
the sun is falling

919
01:09:35,490 --> 01:09:37,865
Now, when you say one, two, three
, pull hard.

920
01:09:38,005 --> 01:09:40,034
one! two! three!

921
01:09:55,505 --> 01:09:57,089
Is that a human coffin?

922
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,141
Where are you going...

923
01:11:07,827 --> 01:11:08,995
Is there a problem?

924
01:11:09,074 --> 01:11:10,909
As I said on the phone

925
01:11:10,934 --> 01:11:13,049
I suddenly moved to a new place

926
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:15,585
I'll take care of you today

927
01:11:17,886 --> 01:11:20,089
They say Sangju
is coming here.

928
01:11:20,590 --> 01:11:23,468
Is there somewhere I can put the coffin ?

929
01:11:43,138 --> 01:11:44,138
why...

930
01:11:44,906 --> 01:11:47,158
What is this...
what is this?

931
01:11:49,007 --> 01:11:50,203
Hey, Bodhisattva.

932
01:11:50,667 --> 01:11:53,830
Excuse me, but do you have some glutinous rice
?

A lieutenant?

937
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:29,117
What on earth is that?

938
01:12:29,574 --> 01:12:33,538
Please tell me everything you know

939
01:12:33,659 --> 01:12:34,998

940
01:12:35,456 --> 01:12:38,001
I really don't know

941
01:12:39,719 --> 01:12:42,213
Why is something like that buried there ?

942
01:12:42,445 --> 01:12:46,523
And why was my father's grave in such a bad place?

943
01:12:47,781 --> 01:12:50,722
It was written in the famous tablet.

944

947
01:13:00,645 --> 01:13:03,767
So the monk
punished my father...

948
01:13:03,792 --> 01:13:05,612
I know

949
01:13:06,738 --> 01:13:08,656

950

01:13:18,291 --> 01:13:20,376
He was Japanese

953
01:13:20,941 --> 01:13:22,786
- yes?
- Are you Japanese?

954
01:13:22,811 --> 01:13:23,979
The name...

955
01:13:24,124 --> 01:13:26,466
My name was Junji Murayama.

956

I heard that he is a person who knows all eight provinces of Joseon.

957
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:35,942
But why did their father, who was loyal to them,

958
01:13:35,967 --> 01:13:40,062
I don't understand why they buried it in such a bad place.

Oh my, that grave
had a bad feeling from the beginning.

979
01:14:47,526 --> 01:14:49,298
- Just stretch the mountain straight and
- Ah... Now that I think about it,

980
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:51,259
I didn't even get to eat a single meal today
, sir...

981
01:14:57,624 --> 01:14:58,474
ruler

982
01:14:58,561 --> 01:15:00,393
Have a drink of this at least

983
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:02,491
- Oh, thank you, oh, thank you.
- Oh, oh, yes.

984
01:15:02,557 --> 01:15:04,856
Well, ayu, ayu,
thank you, I'll enjoy it, yeah

985
01:15:04,963 --> 01:15:06,670
Well, take care of your health.

986
01:15:06,897 --> 01:15:08,526
This scent is, well...

987
01:15:11,349 --> 01:15:13,271
Oh, this is precious, this

988
01:15:13,345 --> 01:15:16,835
- Oh my, a cup of Bodhisattva...
- Oh my, it's hot.

989
01:15:16,921 --> 01:15:18,268
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Let's get a drink.

990
01:15:18,341 --> 01:15:20,038
Is there
any acorn jelly...

991
01:15:20,128 --> 01:15:22,373
<i>Hey, I just
said this once for a laugh...</i>

992
01:15:24,003 --> 01:15:28,931


993
01:15:31,285 --> 01:15:33,068
Yes, Junji Murayama

994
01:15:33,341 --> 01:15:34,677
<i>Don’t you remember?</i>

995
01:15:34,702 --> 01:15:37,864
<i>The teacher
sometimes said this before</i>

996
01:15:37,889 --> 01:15:39,432
<i>In Japan, that...</i>

997
01:15:39,457 --> 01:15:41,255
<i>Yes, fox onmyoji</i>

998
01:15:42,435 --> 01:15:43,936
yes, that's right

999
01:15:44,461 --> 01:15:46,269
Onmyoji Murayama

1000
01:15:46,294 --> 01:15:48,963
<i>I heard I met a teacher
once a long time ago...</i>

1001
01:15:49,172 --> 01:15:51,986
<i>The Lord is so strong
that he is a human being</i>

1002
01:15:52,011 --> 01:15:53,870
<i>It's obviously a fox cub, why</i>

1003
01:15:54,384 --> 01:15:55,517
<i>Are you here?</i>

1004
01:15:55,597 --> 01:15:56,597
<i>Where are you now?</i>

1005
01:15:56,622 --> 01:15:58,200
Uh, no

1006
01:15:58,493 --> 01:15:59,619
okay

1007
01:15:59,919 --> 01:16:01,721
Thank you, Gwangsim unnie.

1008
01:16:02,330 --> 01:16:03,873
I'll call you again

1009
01:16:10,507 --> 01:16:11,839
Grandma...

1010
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:14,676
Grandma...

1011
01:16:19,294 --> 01:16:21,391
I feel strange...

1012
01:17:07,065 --> 01:17:08,813
oh my...

1013
01:17:19,252 --> 01:17:20,950
They took my liver...

1014
01:17:21,056 --> 01:17:22,057
My liver...

1015
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,471
My liver...

1016
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:30,251
They took my liver,
my liver

1017
01:17:30,319 --> 01:17:32,128
Some guy
took my liver

1018
01:17:32,205 --> 01:17:33,758
Some guy took my liver

1019
01:17:33,852 --> 01:17:35,038
They took my liver

1020
01:17:35,104 --> 01:17:36,417
Because they took my liver

1021
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:37,804
They took my liver

1022
01:17:37,871 --> 01:17:38,755
where are my clothes

1023
01:17:38,828 --> 01:17:39,919
Where are my clothes?

1024
01:17:39,986 --> 01:17:42,045
my clothes, my clothes, my clothes

1025
01:17:42,118 --> 01:17:44,724
- Ha... fuck...
- Where are my clothes?

1026
01:17:44,791 --> 01:17:45,995
Some guy
took my liver

1027
01:17:46,069 --> 01:17:47,727
My clothes... my liver...

1028
01:17:47,789 --> 01:17:48,920
They took my liver...

1029
01:19:00,128 --> 01:19:01,550
madam...

1030
01:19:42,285 --> 01:19:43,384
Hwarim-ah

1031
01:19:58,528 --> 01:20:00,485
Madam, really, sir...

1032
01:20:09,287 --> 01:20:11,204
Oh,
fuck Nurinnae...

1033
01:20:26,991 --> 01:20:29,054
The seal pierced my stomach.

1034
01:20:33,431 --> 01:20:35,147
This now...

1035
01:20:37,313 --> 01:20:38,522
What is this, you bastard?

1036
01:20:38,523 --> 01:20:39,523
speak up

1037
01:20:42,110 --> 01:20:43,486
This now...

1038
01:20:44,195 --> 01:20:45,905
I think it's in the barn down there.

1039
01:20:47,615 --> 01:20:49,200
Wake up people quickly

1040
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:50,410
yes

1041
01:24:04,841 --> 01:24:06,731
Do... do, run away

1042
01:24:07,348 --> 01:24:08,348
Bong Gil-ah

1043
01:24:43,376 --> 01:24:44,978
Bong...Bong Gil-ah

1044
01:26:55,660 --> 01:26:56,901
Cough...

1045
01:27:13,466 --> 01:27:14,466
Cough...

1046
01:27:17,422 --> 01:27:18,588
Bonggil...

1047
01:27:18,589 --> 01:27:19,799
Bong Gil-ah

1048
01:27:20,383 --> 01:27:22,175
Bonggil! Bonggil!

1049
01:27:22,176 --> 01:27:23,136
Wake!

1050
01:27:23,137 --> 01:27:25,595
Chungju High School regular butler 350,000 won...

1051
01:27:25,596 --> 01:27:28,891
- Bong-gil...
- Kim Young-ja from Sunshine Cafe 700,000 won...

1052
01:27:29,434 --> 01:27:31,476
- Bong-gil, Bong-gil, come to your senses
- broadcaster 170,000 won

1053
01:27:31,477 --> 01:27:34,006
- What should I do...
- I have to pay back 2 million won to Cheonil Sangjo...

1054
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:37,650
- Mirae Essen subtracted 5 million won...
- Teacher, please help me!

1055
01:27:38,069 --> 01:27:39,861
Ask for help!

1056
01:27:41,404 --> 01:27:43,406
Help!

1057
01:27:43,496 --> 01:27:45,365
Help me...

1058
01:27:45,366 --> 01:27:47,159
Bong-gil, come to your senses.

1059
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:49,078
Come to your senses,
Bong-gil...

1060
01:28:01,716 --> 01:28:03,383
<i>This morning
in Goseong, Gangwon-do</i>

1061
01:28:03,384 --> 01:28:05,093
<i>Human casualties due to wild bear attacks...</i>

1062
01:28:05,094 --> 01:28:08,555
Neither of you have fever, so
I'll give you some fever reducer.

1063
01:28:08,556 --> 01:28:10,349
<i>At the damaged village barn</i>

1064
01:28:10,350 --> 01:28:13,769
<i>Dozens of pigs
were found with their abdomens torn</i>

1065
01:28:13,770 --> 01:28:17,773
<i> Two additional bodies from the same attack were found</i>

1066
01:28:17,774 --> 01:28:19,733
<i>The victim
was a monk from a nearby temple</i>

1067
01:28:19,734 --> 01:28:23,028
<i> It turned out to be a migrant worker who worked at the livestock farm </i>

1068
01:28:23,029 --> 01:28:26,073
<i>County officials are
currently working with local governments and military units</i>

1069
01:28:26,074 --> 01:28:28,076
<i>Chasing wild bears,
etc...</i>

1070
01:28:57,647 --> 01:28:59,189
sorry...

1071
01:29:00,322 --> 01:29:03,069
I
asked to bring it out for no reason...

1072
01:29:04,070 --> 01:29:05,863
Same thing with Bonggil...

1073
01:29:07,865 --> 01:29:09,867
Bodhisattva too...

1074
01:29:11,570 --> 01:29:15,665
Bong-gil got sick while playing baseball
and quit...

1075
01:29:18,110 --> 01:29:21,412
When I came to my teacher after being abandoned by my family

1076
01:29:21,969 --> 01:29:24,549
I told you not to be a shaman ...

1077
01:29:26,835 --> 01:29:28,886
It's okay if you're with me...

1078
01:29:29,011 --> 01:29:32,223
I said there was nothing to be afraid of
...

1079
01:29:40,404 --> 01:29:42,859
I stayed quiet because I was scared.

1080
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:52,785
There were footprints

1081
01:29:53,546 --> 01:29:55,413
And the shadows...

1082
01:29:56,235 --> 01:29:57,671
In shamanism

1083
01:29:58,045 --> 01:29:59,375
There is an orthodoxy

1084
01:30:00,421 --> 01:30:03,796
The soul is imperfect and
the ears have no body.

1085
01:30:05,423 --> 01:30:08,968
So in the end, a person's
intact mind and body

1086
01:30:09,041 --> 01:30:10,963
I mean, you can never win.

1087
01:30:12,436 --> 01:30:13,806
But that...

1088
01:30:14,140 --> 01:30:15,850
It's completely different.

1089
01:30:16,684 --> 01:30:18,353
not a spirit

1090
01:30:18,811 --> 01:30:20,063
It's a spirit

1091
01:30:21,439 --> 01:30:23,900
- Spirit?
- The soul of a person or animal

1092
01:30:24,108 --> 01:30:26,736
We evolved together by attaching ourselves to things.

1093
01:30:28,733 --> 01:30:31,616
This should never happen in our country ...

1094
01:30:35,174 --> 01:30:37,622
I didn't feel anything

1095
01:30:38,539 --> 01:30:40,291
What is it?

1096
01:30:40,409 --> 01:30:41,626
where did you come from

1097
01:30:42,564 --> 01:30:45,295
Why was it at the Park family tomb?

1098
01:30:50,593 --> 01:30:53,304
There is a lot of damage to the abdominal viscera.

1099
01:30:53,638 --> 01:30:55,390
I shed a lot of blood

1100
01:30:55,765 --> 01:30:58,726
But the problem is that
I have some damage to my spine...

1101
01:30:59,435 --> 01:31:01,688
Let’s send him to a big hospital quickly.

1102
01:31:02,563 --> 01:31:05,191
<i>Because the damage is caused by wild animals...</i>

1103
01:31:14,395 --> 01:31:17,161
The fox
cut off the tiger's waist

1104
01:31:38,015 --> 01:31:39,621
At that time, there was a lot of robbery.

1105
01:31:39,701 --> 01:31:41,624
I heard that the tomb was kept in a simple manner in a place that no one knows about.

1106
01:31:41,710 --> 01:31:46,482
The robbers' luggage
is still in the warehouse.

1107
01:32:16,091 --> 01:32:19,265
‘Our land, my comrades’

1108
01:32:19,346 --> 01:32:20,558
Iron Blood Order?

1109
01:32:26,814 --> 01:32:29,657
Organ damage has been prevented in a hurry ...

1110
01:32:29,903 --> 01:32:32,823
I need to check further

1111
01:32:33,050 --> 01:32:36,012
First, I have to regain consciousness
...

1112
01:32:36,532 --> 01:32:38,201
It's strange.

1113
01:32:38,917 --> 01:32:41,036
Oh, what is this?

1114
01:32:41,037 --> 01:32:43,389
Fortunately, I passed the crisis.

1115
01:32:43,414 --> 01:32:45,271
He said his spine was slightly injured.

1116
01:32:45,333 --> 01:32:46,541
I heard you can walk?

1117
01:32:46,542 --> 01:32:48,169
They say you have to overcome it

1118
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:49,587
But I'm still healthy

1119
01:32:51,589 --> 01:32:53,569
What on earth are you doing these days
?

1120
01:32:53,594 --> 01:32:54,976
What?

1121
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:56,863
sister

1122
01:32:56,887 --> 01:32:57,845
huh?

1123
01:32:57,983 --> 01:33:00,013
It smells like you're enjoying it?

1124
01:33:02,573 --> 01:33:04,898
I know
, that's why I called you

1125
01:33:05,401 --> 01:33:07,563
Let's play goblin for the first time in a while

1126
01:33:09,349 --> 01:33:10,822
Park Jahye, what are you doing?

1127
01:33:11,273 --> 01:33:12,309
lock the door

1128
01:33:12,309 --> 01:33:17,924


1129
01:33:21,675 --> 01:33:22,995
Badge per...

1130
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:24,824
Lee Chung-gu...

1131
01:33:25,164 --> 01:33:26,438
Park Gil-ho

1132
01:33:27,204 --> 01:33:28,580
Shin Pal-gyun

1133
01:33:30,503 --> 01:33:32,046
Kim Jeongbok

1134
01:33:32,504 --> 01:33:34,674
Song Jong-ik...

1135
01:33:34,699 --> 01:33:36,445
min...

1136
01:33:36,445 --> 01:33:37,445
radical

1137
01:33:38,117 --> 01:33:41,222
Jeon Tae-hwan, Lim Chung-shin

1138
01:33:42,265 --> 01:33:43,474
yes...

1139
01:33:43,975 --> 01:33:45,560
It's so tragic

1140
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:48,021
For grave robbers

1141
01:34:09,331 --> 01:34:10,684
Creation of low hell terrain

1142
01:34:10,758 --> 01:34:12,336
Yongjangbongjeon Jajiijin

1143
01:34:12,337 --> 01:34:14,422
Booby Speedy Pyeonyeok Yeongcheon

1144
01:34:16,495 --> 01:34:19,761
Wow, ladies,
it’s been a long time.

1145
01:34:20,207 --> 01:34:21,410
Everyone came?

1146
01:34:21,435 --> 01:34:23,091
i just came

1147
01:34:23,282 --> 01:34:25,728
The harvest is over and
the weather is getting chilly.

1148
01:34:25,753 --> 01:34:27,786
How come everyone is like a dog?

1149
01:34:27,811 --> 01:34:30,521
Oh my,
everyone gathered like this.

1150
01:34:30,667 --> 01:34:32,820
Hurry up , you have to bring some ups and downs .

1151
01:34:32,845 --> 01:34:34,527
don't worry

1152
01:34:34,552 --> 01:34:38,584
I already
made some rice cake and some boiled pork.

1153
01:34:38,609 --> 01:34:42,264
Where did I hear that a delicious smell
wafts from the air?

1154
01:34:42,450 --> 01:34:43,743
I brought it because I had plenty of it, right?

1155
01:34:43,768 --> 01:34:46,317
I brought my hearing loss

1156
01:34:46,455 --> 01:34:48,539
Even if you eat it, there will be no residue!

1157
01:34:48,569 --> 01:34:50,020
Then I live beyond the horizon

1158
01:34:50,045 --> 01:34:52,429
Do you think we should invite Jang and Jecheon’s house too ?

1159
01:34:52,454 --> 01:34:54,700
What are you calling a busy person for?

1160
01:34:54,725 --> 01:34:56,655
If we just
stay quietly and deliciously...

1161
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:59,037
Okay...
let's eat together.

1162
01:34:59,062 --> 01:35:01,645
Did you catch some sweetfish?

1163
01:35:07,060 --> 01:35:08,060
What?

1164
01:35:08,363 --> 01:35:10,461
Where do you think Seobu Yoon
came from?

1165
01:35:10,486 --> 01:35:12,342
Ah, what are you talking about?

1166
01:35:12,527 --> 01:35:13,996
Have you not heard of Seobu Yoon’s Yag?

1167
01:35:14,020 --> 01:35:15,650
Well done

1168
01:35:15,789 --> 01:35:17,859
Ah, there is no way Seobu Yoon could have come.

1169
01:35:17,860 --> 01:35:19,529
What is everyone saying?

1170
01:35:19,693 --> 01:35:20,836
Don't you talk quickly?

1171
01:35:20,861 --> 01:35:22,615
Don't even talk to me

1172
01:35:23,282 --> 01:35:26,318
Where on earth did you say you met something terribly dangerous
?

1173
01:35:26,343 --> 01:35:28,408
Why did I encounter something so difficult?

1174
01:35:28,563 --> 01:35:30,709
Does that
mean he was lying down sick?

1175
01:35:30,802 --> 01:35:31,802
You don’t know?

1176
01:35:32,981 --> 01:35:34,597
I met a guest during the night.

1177
01:35:37,075 --> 01:35:39,455
What the fuck are you talking about...

1178
01:35:40,676 --> 01:35:42,682
Oh my, Seobang Yoon?

1179
01:35:43,519 --> 01:35:45,471
What are you doing?
Are you lying down scared?

1180
01:35:47,178 --> 01:35:48,221
woah

1181
01:35:48,525 --> 01:35:50,518
Does this guy look fine?

1182
01:35:51,853 --> 01:35:53,250
Who are you?

1183
01:35:54,272 --> 01:35:56,691
The customer who said he met a dick?

1184
01:35:57,150 --> 01:35:58,735
Just tell me at once

1185
01:36:01,446 --> 01:36:04,490
master

1186
01:36:05,726 --> 01:36:07,035
master?

1187
01:36:07,785 --> 01:36:09,119
What kind of master?

1188
01:36:15,845 --> 01:36:18,705
Speak quickly, you son of a bitch.

1189
01:36:26,525 --> 01:36:31,578
{\an8}My master
is the one who killed 10,000 people and became a god.

1190
01:36:35,972 --> 01:36:38,083
{\an8}That Lord

1191
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:41,723
{\an8}Where are you now...

1192
01:37:02,125 --> 01:37:13,269
{\an8}three eight three four one seven one two eight three one eight nine

1193
01:37:15,515 --> 01:37:16,854
It's Sakura...

1194
01:37:18,237 --> 01:37:22,881
{\an8}The general who guards that place

1195
01:37:39,386 --> 01:37:40,837
What the fuck...

1196
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:46,975
{\an8}Master!
Please look at me!

1197
01:37:46,975 --> 01:37:53,149
{\an8}Here I am,
I want to be your body

1198
01:38:06,408 --> 01:38:09,324
I'll take out that meat for you.

1199
01:38:10,916 --> 01:38:12,201
Jahye

1200
01:38:12,994 --> 01:38:14,662
Come to work

1201
01:38:15,121 --> 01:38:17,040
Please save me, Jahye...

1202
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:25,840
Oh, motherfuckers

1203
01:38:25,953 --> 01:38:27,204
you all die

1204
01:38:41,448 --> 01:38:43,336
Hwarim, don’t do this.

1205
01:38:43,361 --> 01:38:44,701
It's a Japanese ghost

1206
01:38:44,726 --> 01:38:46,168
I know

1207
01:38:46,193 --> 01:38:48,696
Even if it has nothing to do with it,
they just kill it.

1208
01:38:48,721 --> 01:38:51,498
They say they kill everyone who comes near them.

1209
01:38:52,367 --> 01:38:54,160
Haven’t I seen you in Japan before
?

1210
01:38:54,410 --> 01:38:56,579
Don't even come near it

1211
01:38:57,872 --> 01:39:00,674
No matter how much your grandmother
is next to you,

1212
01:39:01,125 --> 01:39:02,852
This doesn't work

1213
01:39:02,877 --> 01:39:04,097
Let's go, Jahye.

1214
01:39:04,420 --> 01:39:05,421
Then what is the length of the bong?

1215
01:39:09,050 --> 01:39:10,176
I'll call you

1216
01:39:10,279 --> 01:39:11,279
let's go

1217
01:39:26,481 --> 01:39:28,319
You mean it's underneath there?

1218
01:39:29,833 --> 01:39:32,002
They say it's back to normal
...

1219
01:39:33,408 --> 01:39:35,367
Ah, but
why did you go there again?

1220
01:39:35,368 --> 01:39:36,368
uh?

1221
01:39:37,256 --> 01:39:38,121
uh?

1222
01:39:38,256 --> 01:39:41,124
Jiyong Park
said that before that gentleman died.

1223
01:39:42,625 --> 01:39:44,961
‘The fox cut off the tiger’s waist’

1224
01:39:47,179 --> 01:39:48,673
Oh, what does that mean?

1225
01:39:48,881 --> 01:39:50,946
In our Feng Shui

1226
01:39:50,971 --> 01:39:53,645
The shape of the land of Joseon
is a tiger.

1227
01:39:54,220 --> 01:39:56,347
A tiger holding a continent

1228
01:39:56,681 --> 01:39:57,473
however?

1229
01:39:57,569 --> 01:39:59,945
The numbers engraved on the back of the tombstone

1230
01:39:59,970 --> 01:40:01,506
latitude and longitude

1231
01:40:01,660 --> 01:40:02,660
Where would it be?

1232
01:40:03,165 --> 01:40:05,123
That's right, there

1233
01:40:05,148 --> 01:40:06,856
exactly the waist of a tiger

1234
01:40:07,377 --> 01:40:09,943
That fox onmyoji that Hwarim talked about

1235
01:40:10,987 --> 01:40:12,822
That fox cub...

1236
01:40:13,990 --> 01:40:15,658
Plus, wow!

1237
01:40:15,992 --> 01:40:18,661
It means that an iron needle the size of a bamboo stick
was stuck in it.

1238
01:40:23,231 --> 01:40:25,585
Then what is the American Park family grave above ?

1239
01:40:27,933 --> 01:40:29,970
Those
serious-looking people over there

1240
01:40:29,995 --> 01:40:32,252
Because I keep looking for things like that and pulling them out.

1241
01:40:32,450 --> 01:40:35,173
At that time, the tomb of a high-ranking official
was just covered over.

1242
01:40:35,198 --> 01:40:36,528
So
they can't even approach it at all

1243
01:40:36,656 --> 01:40:37,555
then

1244
01:40:37,556 --> 01:40:39,015
Why are there ghosts there?

1245
01:40:40,183 --> 01:40:41,184
uh?

1246
01:40:43,585 --> 01:40:48,584
{\an8}You are the general who protects the castle.

1247
01:40:53,510 --> 01:40:57,553
{\an8}three eight three four one seven one two eight three one eight nine

1248
01:40:58,246 --> 01:40:59,452
maybe...

1249
01:41:00,411 --> 01:41:02,497
I think that's what's protecting the iron needle.

1250
01:41:17,202 --> 01:41:18,482
Lee Hwa-rim

1251
01:41:18,507 --> 01:41:19,739
we...

1252
01:41:19,763 --> 01:41:21,557
It's a business relationship

1253
01:41:22,433 --> 01:41:24,616
- Let me ask you a favor that doesn't cost money.
- Hey, what...

1254
01:41:24,641 --> 01:41:26,658
If you're thinking about something useless
, don't say anything.

1255
01:41:26,683 --> 01:41:27,697
Well, is it the national spirit?

1256
01:41:27,722 --> 01:41:30,553
Well, they cut the country in half with iron stakes .

1257
01:41:30,578 --> 01:41:32,093
Do you still believe that?

1258
01:41:32,118 --> 01:41:34,592
All the iron needles in that temple are for land surveying.

1259
01:41:34,617 --> 01:41:35,983
You know

1260
01:41:36,219 --> 01:41:39,033
Previous academic conferences also
said that 99% are fake.

1261
01:41:39,058 --> 01:41:40,226
So what about 1%?

1262
01:41:42,078 --> 01:41:43,154
Elder Go

1263
01:41:43,178 --> 01:41:44,372
why?

1264
01:41:44,492 --> 01:41:46,566
This
is different from just an ordinary strange thing

1265
01:41:46,591 --> 01:41:48,876
There's something meticulously
calculated.

1266
01:41:50,575 --> 01:41:53,975
Not long ago, you saw people dying because of that grave.

1267
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,563
Do you want to get stabbed again?

1268
01:41:56,069 --> 01:41:57,010
older brother

1269
01:41:57,011 --> 01:41:59,031
No matter what the iron needle was stuck in
, just

1270
01:41:59,056 --> 01:42:02,294
We've lived well
without any problems so far.

1271
01:42:02,319 --> 01:42:03,997
But
why are you doing that now?

1272
01:42:04,163 --> 01:42:05,226
okay

1273
01:42:05,893 --> 01:42:07,395
You or me

1274
01:42:07,589 --> 01:42:09,601
We
sold the land to rich people

1275
01:42:09,626 --> 01:42:11,112
I ate well and lived well during that time.

1276
01:42:11,690 --> 01:42:13,023
It's because of me

1277
01:42:13,048 --> 01:42:15,467
Elder
Go This is land, land!

1278
01:42:16,892 --> 01:42:20,199
This is the land that my future grandchildren
will have to step on and live on.

1279
01:42:20,224 --> 01:42:22,893
And you and me
and all of us!

1280
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:25,190
And then
someone

1281
01:42:28,708 --> 01:42:31,044
Hwarim, they say it’s a spirit.

1282
01:42:31,129 --> 01:42:33,640
If , as you say, it
is a ghost attached to metal, then

1283
01:42:33,665 --> 01:42:36,116
Can't we just take the needle out
?

1284
01:42:36,141 --> 01:42:39,520
Then, if the iron needle disappears,
the length of the pole can become better.

1285
01:42:44,807 --> 01:42:45,642
Hey, what...

1286
01:42:45,643 --> 01:42:48,827
Well,
I heard he's a general or something that's holding on like this.

1287
01:42:48,852 --> 01:42:50,592
But how do you pull it out

1288
01:42:50,812 --> 01:42:52,481
You saw it at that temple.

1289
01:42:52,482 --> 01:42:54,192
Oh, I really...

1290
01:42:55,318 --> 01:42:57,445
Calling me like an animal...

1291
01:42:59,614 --> 01:43:01,908
speak with spirit

1292
01:43:04,252 --> 01:43:06,454
<i>Brother, do you really
think this is possible?</i>

1293
01:43:06,563 --> 01:43:07,997
<i>There is something we
can do</i>

1294
01:43:08,022 --> 01:43:10,900
- There's something I can't do
- I'm sorry, but that ghost...

1295
01:43:11,553 --> 01:43:13,169
It's not something that can be eliminated.

1296
01:43:14,227 --> 01:43:15,750
Even if there is no resentment

1297
01:43:16,214 --> 01:43:18,434
It kills everyone even if they come near it.

1298
01:43:18,758 --> 01:43:20,426
It's a Japanese ghost

1299
01:43:21,830 --> 01:43:22,970
however...

1300
01:43:23,083 --> 01:43:25,139
I can't get rid of it...

1301
01:43:27,849 --> 01:43:29,435
I can come out for a moment

1302
01:43:31,104 --> 01:43:33,147
I can take the time

1303
01:43:42,387 --> 01:43:43,616
Bong Gil-ah

1304
01:43:46,638 --> 01:43:48,997
<i>Please
give me some more betadine</i>

1305
01:43:49,167 --> 01:43:51,748
<i>I'll clean it with saline solution one more time
and put a gauze on it</i>

1306
01:43:51,749 --> 01:43:52,750
<i>네</i>

1307
01:43:53,418 --> 01:43:54,711
Wait

1308
01:43:59,885 --> 01:44:01,970
Did you avoid this bastard’s tattoo?

1309
01:44:02,927 --> 01:44:04,595
What kind of tattoo is this?

1310
01:44:05,802 --> 01:44:07,473
That's a blessing

1311
01:44:32,325 --> 01:44:34,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

1312
01:44:34,417 --> 01:44:37,462
There is damage from that wild animal nearby.

1313
01:44:39,630 --> 01:44:41,716
- Oh, I... uh...
- Hehe...

1314
01:44:41,966 --> 01:44:43,676
where...

1315
01:44:44,052 --> 01:44:46,304
Are you on your way...

1316
01:44:46,329 --> 01:44:48,279
Ah... there...

1317
01:44:48,927 --> 01:44:52,143
We
came to that mountain to cut down the grass.

1318
01:44:52,255 --> 01:44:53,381
Ah, yes, that...

1319
01:44:53,519 --> 01:44:57,690
A few days ago,
a military unit was searching the mountain over there.

1320
01:44:57,749 --> 01:44:59,144
- Ah...
- Ah, we...

1321
01:44:59,244 --> 01:45:00,860
Well, it went up quickly and then

1322
01:45:00,930 --> 01:45:02,612
I'll be back soon after working on it.

1323
01:45:02,671 --> 01:45:03,821
Ah, yes

1324
01:45:04,113 --> 01:45:05,113
Open it for you

1325
01:46:02,046 --> 01:46:04,517
<i>Withdraw, withdraw
, return, return</i>

1326
01:46:04,542 --> 01:46:06,040
Because I gave you what you wanted

1327
01:46:06,237 --> 01:46:08,886
It will probably move around 10:00 o'clock

1328
01:46:09,606 --> 01:46:11,632
If you just lure the yew tree...

1329
01:46:12,213 --> 01:46:14,767
I'll take as long as I can

1330
01:46:15,268 --> 01:46:17,979
We'll pick it up soon

1331
01:46:18,146 --> 01:46:20,440
Okay,
just wait for 30 minutes.

1332
01:46:20,585 --> 01:46:21,690
and two minutes

1333
01:46:21,691 --> 01:46:22,942
If you take out the iron needle

1334
01:46:25,978 --> 01:46:29,065
I will wash it away with the blood of this horse.

1335
01:46:31,075 --> 01:46:32,285
Mr. Kim

1336
01:46:33,119 --> 01:46:34,829
That iron needle...

1337
01:46:36,039 --> 01:46:37,165
It really exists, right?

1338
01:46:41,044 --> 01:46:42,669
one hundred percent

1339
01:46:50,557 --> 01:46:51,557
sister

1340
01:46:51,582 --> 01:46:53,473
Please look after Bonggil today.

1341
01:46:53,623 --> 01:46:56,267
If things go wrong,
Bonggil is in danger.

1342
01:47:17,538 --> 01:47:18,748
stop looking

1343
01:47:19,302 --> 01:47:21,167
They say it came out at a celebration.

1344
01:47:33,888 --> 01:47:35,223
Elder Go

1345
01:47:36,236 --> 01:47:38,438
Anyway, thank you for coming with me.

1346
01:47:38,524 --> 01:47:40,134
‘ It only takes one person to defeat’

1347
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:42,640
‘Can two people fight against each other?’

1348
01:47:42,850 --> 01:47:45,343
‘A three-ply cord is not easily broken .’

1349
01:47:46,134 --> 01:47:47,735
Ecclesiastes 4:12

1350
01:47:50,571 --> 01:47:51,656
amen

1351
01:48:08,924 --> 01:48:10,091
sister

1352
01:48:11,187 --> 01:48:13,125
I hope they don't kill him

1353
01:48:14,679 --> 01:48:17,056
I will die instead of you.

1354
01:48:18,891 --> 01:48:22,353
And why are you saying that when you’re having a good time staying in Kyochon?

1355
01:51:23,342 --> 01:51:25,512
{\an8}Have you eaten your fill?

1356
01:51:43,137 --> 01:51:44,347
It's this way

1357
01:51:56,390 --> 01:51:58,795
{\an8}Is anyone there?

1358
01:52:03,694 --> 01:52:06,511
{\an8}My mountain is noisy

1359
01:52:10,848 --> 01:52:14,937
{\an8} Is this mountain the old man’s mountain?

1360
01:52:16,975 --> 01:52:21,166
{\an8}Yes,
this is my mountain.

1361
01:52:21,191 --> 01:52:25,103
{\an8}You damn tree old man.

1362
01:52:25,128 --> 01:52:30,267
{\an8}But why
can't I hear the sound of guns and swords?

1363
01:52:30,268 --> 01:52:32,239
{\an8}That's not it

1364
01:52:33,282 --> 01:52:35,047
{\an8}The war has already ended a long time ago

1365
01:52:35,047 --> 01:52:36,452
{\an8}No

1366
01:52:36,881 --> 01:52:40,128
{\an8}Our war is not over yet

1367
01:52:51,970 --> 01:52:56,481
{\an8}Why are you
here?

1368
01:52:58,769 --> 01:53:04,209
{\an8} That fox enshrined me in Daitoku

1369
01:53:04,209 --> 01:53:09,545
{\an8}I brought you here, not the shrine in Namsan.

1370
01:53:11,055 --> 01:53:13,953
{\an8}It must have been Katahito’s children who ordered it.

1371
01:53:13,953 --> 01:53:17,233
{\an8}Or maybe it was Makoto's doing...

1372
01:53:25,562 --> 01:53:28,067
{\an8}Now this is a land of silence

1373
01:53:28,092 --> 01:53:30,438
{\an8}This is no longer your place

1374
01:53:33,962 --> 01:53:37,020
{\an8}No
no

1375
01:53:37,021 --> 01:53:40,621
{\an8}We must continue to aim for blessings

1376
01:53:40,621 --> 01:53:43,807
{\an8}Go forward with your guns and swords

1377
01:53:43,807 --> 01:53:46,348
{\an8}To the north

1378
01:53:46,349 --> 01:53:51,023
{\an8}A brave centipede never steps back

1379
01:53:58,609 --> 01:53:59,565
what?

1380
01:53:59,816 --> 01:54:01,401
Nothing comes out

1381
01:54:01,426 --> 01:54:02,649
AC...

1382
01:54:06,293 --> 01:54:08,825
{\an8}As the owner of this place, I will bite again.

1383
01:54:09,623 --> 01:54:12,004
{\an8}Since when have you been here?

1384
01:54:13,014 --> 01:54:15,380
{\an8}Be polite to me

1385
01:54:16,338 --> 01:54:19,853
{\an8}I am fear

1386
01:54:20,592 --> 01:54:22,297
{\an8}This is my land

1387
01:54:22,297 --> 01:54:24,940
{\an8}I ask again,
what on earth are you!

1388
01:54:31,068 --> 01:54:33,125
Hey, there isn't any.

1389
01:54:33,364 --> 01:54:34,726
No, Mr...

1390
01:54:36,436 --> 01:54:37,478
No!

1391
01:54:37,547 --> 01:54:38,687
Oh, it's 100%!

1392
01:54:47,385 --> 01:54:48,698
Mr. Lee...

1393
01:54:48,778 --> 01:54:49,991
madam...

1394
01:54:50,352 --> 01:54:52,284
{\an8}Remember

1395
01:54:53,496 --> 01:55:00,182
{\an8}The enemies cut off my head in Sekigahara, but
I have already defeated the body.

1396
01:55:00,182 --> 01:55:02,968
{\an8}I am the god of war!

1397
01:55:02,968 --> 01:55:07,429
{\an8}The eternal and incorruptible master
is a flaming sword.

1398
01:55:09,218 --> 01:55:11,637
three eight three four one seven one two eight three one eight nine

1399
01:55:11,701 --> 01:55:18,260
{\an8} That fox is casting a spell on me
and I have to protect this place.

1400
01:55:29,730 --> 01:55:32,434
{\an8}Are you dominating someone right now?

1401
01:55:34,396 --> 01:55:38,098
{\an8}Please free the humans you are holding on to.

1402
01:55:38,739 --> 01:55:39,739
{\an8}Quickly!

1403
01:55:40,403 --> 01:55:42,008
{\an8}Please!

1404
01:55:51,157 --> 01:55:52,560
{\an8}He is human

1405
01:55:53,547 --> 01:55:55,016
{\an8}Forward

1406
01:55:56,283 --> 01:55:57,662
{\an8}Forward

1407
01:55:58,749 --> 01:56:00,276
{\an8}Forward

1408
01:56:02,353 --> 01:56:04,032
{\an8}Forward

1409
01:56:14,028 --> 01:56:16,495
{\an8}Damn old woman

1410
01:56:38,391 --> 01:56:40,058
The sun
spits out the fire of samadhi

1411
01:56:40,059 --> 01:56:42,436
- Subdue the light of Mun-eup to Cheonbong Station
- Make the Geumgang subdue the monster

1412
01:56:42,437 --> 01:56:45,315
- I change the dirty traces that cause illness...
- into good and auspicious things...

1413
01:56:47,025 --> 01:56:48,775
- Huh, did you find it?
- doesn't exist

1414
01:56:48,776 --> 01:56:50,402
- Nothing
. - Oh, what does that mean?

1415
01:56:50,403 --> 01:56:51,457
Oh, there's nothing!

1416
01:56:51,530 --> 01:56:52,696
Quickly withdraw...

1417
01:56:52,697 --> 01:56:53,865
her...

1418
01:57:09,862 --> 01:57:10,965
Ah, brother

1419
01:57:14,385 --> 01:57:15,720
This can't be happening...

1420
01:57:15,839 --> 01:57:17,180
This can't be happening

1421
01:57:29,636 --> 01:57:32,746
{\an8}Three eight three four one seven one two eight one eight nine

1422
01:57:32,746 --> 01:57:36,338
{\an8}My daimyo,
please return!

1423
01:57:36,363 --> 01:57:40,637
{\an8}three eight three four one seven one two eight three one eight nine

1424
01:57:40,662 --> 01:57:42,621
Sangdeok Kim!

1425
01:57:55,033 --> 01:57:56,235
older brother!

1426
01:57:56,260 --> 01:57:57,260
Come out quickly!

1427
01:58:11,323 --> 01:58:13,295
Then why is that ghost there ?

1428
01:58:13,382 --> 01:58:15,241
They said he was the general guarding that place.

1429
01:58:15,327 --> 01:58:17,168
It means it's back to where it was before .

1430
01:58:17,228 --> 01:58:19,366
Have you ever seen a vertical pipe ?

1431
01:58:23,559 --> 01:58:24,914
It's fire

1432
01:58:25,873 --> 01:58:28,918
the fire goes into the ground

1433
01:58:30,003 --> 01:58:31,003
come out!

1434
01:58:46,296 --> 01:58:48,325
{\an8}Will you become my subordinate?

1435
01:58:50,750 --> 01:58:52,208
{\an8}Otherwise

1436
01:58:53,209 --> 01:58:55,462
{\an8}Would you give up your liver?

1437
01:58:59,942 --> 01:59:04,137
{\an8} Have you memorized everything written on your body?

1438
01:59:05,612 --> 01:59:07,515
{\an8}It's been over 500 years

1439
01:59:10,653 --> 01:59:12,670
iron stuck in the ground

1440
01:59:14,047 --> 01:59:16,299
the fire that protects it

1441
01:59:17,111 --> 01:59:19,015
{\an8} Season...

1442
01:59:20,230 --> 01:59:21,991
{\an8}Please eat

1443
01:59:22,726 --> 01:59:24,694
{\an8}That fresh liver

1444
01:59:30,272 --> 01:59:31,313
damn!

1445
01:59:31,314 --> 01:59:32,607
Horse blood! Horse blood here!

1446
01:59:46,789 --> 01:59:48,828
{\an8}Blood of the White Horse

1447
01:59:50,165 --> 01:59:51,372
{\an8}It's hot

1448
01:59:56,937 --> 01:59:58,898
{\an8}Go in and

1449
01:59:59,623 --> 02:00:03,530
{\an8}You must never hear it again.

1450
02:00:06,557 --> 02:00:07,892
It's a spirit

1451
02:00:08,833 --> 02:00:10,812
The soul of a person or animal

1452
02:00:11,450 --> 02:00:13,231
We evolved together by attaching ourselves to things.

1453
02:00:16,359 --> 02:00:17,443
okay...

1454
02:00:17,860 --> 02:00:19,278
It's iron

1455
02:00:20,924 --> 02:00:24,534
You are the burning iron

1456
02:00:30,790 --> 02:00:31,874
older brother!

1457
02:00:32,166 --> 02:00:33,960
- Brother
- Come to your senses!

1458
02:00:34,038 --> 02:00:35,586
Come on, we have to get out quickly.

1459
02:01:24,677 --> 02:01:27,179
God,
I too, God is coming

1460
02:01:27,180 --> 02:01:32,101
hear hear hear hear

1461
02:01:34,687 --> 02:01:36,356
It's dirt...

1462
02:01:38,441 --> 02:01:40,318
And it's a tree

1463
02:01:41,235 --> 02:01:45,990
On the spirit of discussion, Tuesday
, Wednesday, Thursday, gold and silver

1464
02:01:46,181 --> 02:01:47,825
make up the four seasons

1465
02:01:53,081 --> 02:01:55,415
Fire and water are opposites

1466
02:01:56,417 --> 02:01:59,294
Gold and wood are also polar opposites.

1467
02:02:08,012 --> 02:02:09,179
done

1468
02:02:27,991 --> 02:02:30,576
Burning iron...

1469
02:02:32,203 --> 02:02:34,163
Its opposite is...

1470
02:02:35,289 --> 02:02:37,375
It's a tree wet with water.

1471
02:02:47,510 --> 02:02:50,053
Water overcomes fire...

1472
02:02:50,054 --> 02:02:51,054
OMG!

1473
02:02:58,062 --> 02:02:59,272
wet wood

1474
02:03:02,358 --> 02:03:04,152
tougher than iron

1475
02:03:19,969 --> 02:03:21,127
Sister, wait a minute.

1476
02:03:22,314 --> 02:03:23,475
The blood is black

1477
02:03:45,318 --> 02:03:46,536
ruler...

1478
02:03:47,230 --> 02:03:48,230
last

1479
02:04:33,074 --> 02:04:34,332
Bong-gil, aren’t you a dog?

1480
02:04:42,125 --> 02:04:43,709
Brother... this...

1481
02:04:43,710 --> 02:04:45,545
- What should I do with this
... - Teacher...

1482
02:04:45,603 --> 02:04:47,212
What should I do... Huh?

1483
02:04:47,213 --> 02:04:49,340
this...

1484
02:04:50,925 --> 02:04:52,719
Die...

1485
02:04:53,511 --> 02:04:56,346
- Fortunately, it doesn't hurt that much
- Hey, Kim Sang-deok!

1486
02:04:56,347 --> 02:04:58,056
Hey, Kim Sang-deok!

1487
02:04:58,057 --> 02:04:59,516
Come to your senses!

1488
02:04:59,517 --> 02:05:02,854
Always lived close to death

1489
02:05:04,939 --> 02:05:05,940
okay

1490
02:05:06,399 --> 02:05:10,028
- This time it's just my turn
- 200 lines.

1491
02:05:12,488 --> 02:05:15,742
Death
is returning to dust

1492
02:05:17,410 --> 02:05:19,829
comfortably...

1493
02:05:21,247 --> 02:05:23,166
Oh, wait a minute.

1494
02:05:23,499 --> 02:05:25,058
daughter's wedding

1495
02:05:25,285 --> 02:05:28,004
Please give me the courage to get through the surgery ...

1496
02:05:28,230 --> 02:05:30,714
Please embrace me with the blood of the Lord ...

1497
02:05:40,796 --> 02:05:43,019
How many people die in a few days?

1498
02:05:43,143 --> 02:05:45,229
Several people were seriously injured

1499
02:05:45,396 --> 02:05:47,768
CCTV was secured following a tip from a village resident ...

1500
02:05:47,793 --> 02:05:50,150
After a long search, the soldiers

1501
02:05:50,193 --> 02:05:53,529
They succeeded in capturing a wild bear alive.

1502
02:05:54,298 --> 02:05:58,801
Public opinion is boiling over whether to kill or save the innocent bear.

1503
02:05:58,826 --> 02:06:01,036
<i>Public opinion for and against
is boiling</i>

1504
02:06:01,037 --> 02:06:04,081
<i> It was originally planned to be killed for the safety of residents ...</i>

1505
02:06:04,082 --> 02:06:05,343
oh my

1506
02:06:05,708 --> 02:06:06,708
I opened my eyes

1507
02:06:08,419 --> 02:06:09,587
older brother

1508
02:06:10,338 --> 02:06:11,713
Can you come to your senses?

1509
02:06:11,714 --> 02:06:12,507
huh?

1510
02:06:12,532 --> 02:06:14,735
Fortunately, Mr. Kim

1511
02:06:14,735 --> 02:06:17,010
He recovered quickly for his age...

1512
02:06:18,513 --> 02:06:20,598
And Bonggil...

1513
02:06:21,015 --> 02:06:21,933
what...

1514
02:06:21,934 --> 02:06:23,725
Oh,
it's a ghost, it's a ghost

1515
02:06:23,726 --> 02:06:26,104
Wow, really...

1516
02:06:27,009 --> 02:06:28,383
This
is our food now

1517
02:06:28,470 --> 02:06:30,607
- Oh, so you eat without me?
- Come on, eat.

1518
02:06:30,608 --> 02:06:31,608
- Please give me one.
- Uh.

1519
02:06:31,609 --> 02:06:33,339
Ha, I will eat well.

1520
02:06:44,288 --> 02:06:46,290
Is this a good restaurant?

1521
02:06:46,457 --> 02:06:48,458
Do you always come here and eat?

1522
02:06:48,459 --> 02:06:50,252
Do you know that I eat something because I want to
?

1523
02:06:50,253 --> 02:06:51,294
I force myself to eat it.

1524
02:06:51,295 --> 02:06:52,588
Because it’s delicious

1525
02:06:52,756 --> 02:06:53,756
delicious

1526
02:06:53,912 --> 02:06:55,549
I'm fasting, so
what should I do?

1527
02:06:55,550 --> 02:06:57,509
- Ah...
- We have to make a living too.

1528
02:06:57,510 --> 02:07:00,221
At this point, my brother, lose some weight.

1529
02:07:07,256 --> 02:07:09,187
After winter passes

1530
02:07:09,188 --> 02:07:11,482
Everyone returned to normal life

1531
02:07:14,068 --> 02:07:15,360
casually

1532
02:07:15,361 --> 02:07:17,113
let's go!

1533
02:08:03,272 --> 02:08:06,454
I told you to align with the sun , right?

1534
02:08:06,479 --> 02:08:09,456
Are you saying that not everything facing south
is good?

1535
02:08:09,608 --> 02:08:10,958
So what should I do?

1536
02:08:11,029 --> 02:08:12,418
Lady... tsk

1537
02:08:14,712 --> 02:08:15,797
uh...

1538
02:08:22,025 --> 02:08:23,096
Yes, next

1539
02:08:23,165 --> 02:08:26,140
There will be a meeting between the bride and groom.

1540
02:08:26,213 --> 02:08:28,059
bride and groom greetings

1541
02:08:38,830 --> 02:08:42,364
Yes, next is the bride and
groom's relatives and family.

1542
02:08:42,365 --> 02:08:43,865
- There will be a photo shoot
- Hey.

1543
02:08:43,866 --> 02:08:46,119
- Please come forward
- Elder Goh

1544
02:08:46,239 --> 02:08:47,495
Hey, come to work

1545
02:08:48,362 --> 02:08:50,487
Ah, why are we filming those relatives
? Why are we...

1546
02:08:50,512 --> 02:08:51,512
Ah!

1547
02:08:54,085 --> 02:08:55,794
- Just take one picture and go
- Mr.

1548
02:08:55,795 --> 02:08:57,422
Just take one picture and go

1549
02:08:57,447 --> 02:09:00,866
- A child is no different from a family member.
- Ah, what kind of family photo are you taking...

1550
02:09:03,875 --> 02:09:05,512
Yes, the tall one in the middle.

1551
02:09:05,513 --> 02:09:07,347
Please go back one space.

1552
02:09:07,348 --> 02:09:09,057
Yes, the person with glasses on the left

1553
02:09:09,058 --> 02:09:10,642
Please stick inside a little bit.

1554
02:09:10,643 --> 02:09:11,643
yes

1555
02:09:11,720 --> 02:09:14,772
- Ah, so they don't overlap
- How can I get my father's belly and my daughter's belly?

1556
02:09:14,821 --> 02:09:17,150
What is this, this is
a child, my true...

1557
02:09:17,232 --> 02:09:18,818
Okay, let's take a picture.

1558
02:09:20,046 --> 02:09:21,046
father of the bride

1559
02:09:21,109 --> 02:09:23,019
I'll look at it from the front.

1560
02:09:23,086 --> 02:09:25,241
Yes, thank you for your hard work

1561
02:09:26,051 --> 02:09:27,618
Now, everyone
smile once

1562
02:09:28,619 --> 02:09:31,507
One, two, three

1563
02:09:31,507 --> 02:09:35,017
Digging
