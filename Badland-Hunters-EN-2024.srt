3
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,484
So-yeon.

4
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,075
Yes.

5
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:00,745
So-yeon.

6
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,206
So-yeon.

7
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,128
Give it a little time.

8
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,713
You'll be born again.

9
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,232
Gi-su!

10
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,316
Yang Gi-su!

11
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,156
Stop.

12
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,533
Let So-yeon go now.

13
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,994
I'm gonna bring her back.

14
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,454
She'll die anyway if you stop me.

15
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,874
-Sir, I will shoot you.
-Gi-su.

16
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,128
Your horrific human experiments
have taken over 100 lives.

17
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,213
This is not going to bring So-yeon back.

18
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:56,301
If you really want to save your daughter,
let her go.

19
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,971
No, I've found a way. I've succeeded!

20
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,640
See here. I'm living proof.

21
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,350
I tested it on myself.

22
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,187
We can bring So-yeon back now.

23
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,981
Yang Gi-su!

24
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,157
No, you can't.

25
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,117
Don't touch it!

26
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,035
Take him away.

27
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:27,248
So-yeon is going to die.
You're going to kill her!

28
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,218
STRONG EARTHQUAKE ALERT

29
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,103
So-yeon.

30
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,505
No!

31
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:29,120
BADLAND HUNTERS

32
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,001
What the hell?

33
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,756
Shit, I'm so fucked.

34
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,395
Help me! Someone help!

35
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,605
Get away from me!

36
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,086
Hey, come on over here.

37
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,881
I pretty much had that in the bag.

38
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,675
Who cares who bags it? Let's take it all.

39
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,344
That looks delicious.

40
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,283
I told you to let me know
if there's any work to be done.

41
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,285
I'm fine, Su-na.

42
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,704
I just went out to get some air.

43
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,540
Grandma, you have bad knees.

44
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,751
Take a seat. I'll handle the rest.

45
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,883
I can't recall the last time it rained.

46
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,181
There's no drinking water
around this area.

47
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,562
Su-na, why don't we find a car

48
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,023
and move to Bus District?

49
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:47,902
I think

50
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,239
I'll just live here with you, Grandma.

51
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,993
It's not like we'd be safe there
just because there are more people.

52
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,121
Remember when we got dragged off
by those cannibals?

53
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,917
They also used to be kind people
before the drought.

54
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,879
Not everyone in the world
is evil like that.

55
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,760
Well, most of the people I've seen
have been like that.

56
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,013
Su-na.

57
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,725
This is what I think.

58
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:23,729
You reap what you sow.

59
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,732
It may seem like
there are many bad people,

60
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,609
but keep embracing people,

61
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,195
and you'll definitely come across
some nice ones.

62
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,447
That's what I believe.

63
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,659
You put way too much faith in people.

64
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,662
That might've been the case
before the world ended.

65
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:44,500
Sadly, I don't really remember
what things were like back then.

66
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:51,215
Actually, we might have to visit
Bus District today.

67
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,802
-Oh, is today the day Nam San is coming?
-Yeah.

68
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,016
How much longer
do we have to put up with dirty water?

69
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,976
We haven't had a drop of rain for months.

70
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,062
This is nothing.

71
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,482
Last year, we had a drought
for over six months.

72
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,713
Hey! We've got meat!

73
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,922
Hurry on over!

74
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,383
All right, line up, everyone! Line up!

75
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,135
Have your trading goods ready.

76
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,596
Hey, mister! Stand in line properly.

77
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,268
Okay.

78
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:45,811
Rubber boots.

79
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,897
-San.
-Rubber boots?

80
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:51,651
Next.

81
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,612
No, that won't do.

82
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:56,739
Looks fine to me.

83
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,287
Here, take it.

84
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,709
Damn, you scared me.

85
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,262
This should be enough

86
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,184
to get me that entire tail portion.

87
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,687
The whole thing.

88
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,356
Can you eat this? Put it away.

89
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:35,236
Once this situation dies down
and things get better,

90
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:38,531
-this will--
-You sure are optimistic, lady.

91
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,910
It's been over three years
since the world ended.

92
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,745
It's time you accept reality!

93
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,790
Hey, here. At least take this. Here.

94
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,669
We really shouldn't do this,
but we'll give it to you in secret.

95
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:53,671
Do I eat it raw?

96
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,631
Cook it first. It's venomous.

97
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:09,603
What is it?

98
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,521
-Rice.
-Rice?

99
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:14,567
Thank you.

100
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,111
-Hello, Ji-wan.
-Su-na!

101
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,029
Hello, mister.

102
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,948
Hey, Su-na. Hello, ma'am.

103
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,032
Hello.

104
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,118
You don't have to come all the way here.

105
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:27,246
We could've visited on our way home.
It must be hard for your grandma.

106
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:30,124
Oh goodness. No, we should come.

107
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:33,252
Su-na owes her life to Nam San, after all.

108
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,880
It's already been three years.

109
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,924
We've relied on your help for so long,
so I just feel bad.

110
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:40,593
You didn't have to.

111
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,261
Thank you, ma'am.

112
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,098
I'm just glad
Su-na's grown up to be a fine person.

113
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,475
Thank you, mister.

114
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,601
Sure.

115
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,103
-Right, well, take some meat today.
-Su-na.

116
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,856
I caught this alligator.

117
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,692
Are you sure it wasn't Mr. Nam San?

118
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,943
It really was me.

119
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,906
I'd like to trade this in, mister.

120
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,701
Your painting? Let's see now.

121
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,579
Wow, a masterpiece.

122
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,039
It's amazing.

123
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,082
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

124
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,627
Where's mine? I go out on hunts with him.

125
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,838
We should make way now.
There are people waiting.

126
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:18,839
I'm so sorry.

127
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,299
See you, mister.

128
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,675
Take care. Goodbye, ma'am.

129
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,177
-We'll be on our way.
-See you.

130
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,094
Next.

131
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:48,661
Man, they've practically set up
a fucking village here.

132
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,329
Living diligently, I see. Damn.

133
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:55,876
Listen up, residents of Bus District!

134
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,670
Let us introduce ourselves.

135
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,382
We're from Jamsil Police Station, okay?

136
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,175
Look at this. See this thing?

137
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:07,429
As long as you folks cooperate,

138
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,140
no one's going to get hurt, okay?

139
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,686
Fuck, no one's answering.

140
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,397
Well, the reason we are hereâ€¦

141
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,857
Let's see. Here it is.

142
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,527
We're on the hunt
for a notorious criminal,

143
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,863
and it just so happened

144
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,907
that we picked up on his scent
in this neighborhood.

145
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:31,120
So I'd like to ask
for your cooperation. Okay?

146
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,830
Wait. Hey.

147
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:36,041
Hey, that guy looks just like him. See?

148
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,793
-It looks like him.
-Take him.

149
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,006
It's not me!

150
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,594
Hey, over there.
Take the one covered in gold.

151
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:53,642
Let go. I'm a woman.

152
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,061
Yeah, I know. This guy's a woman.

153
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,021
He's a woman?

154
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,150
Hey! You!

155
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:04,653
Let's go.

156
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,156
Let go. Damn it.

157
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,993
You're strong, you fuck.

158
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,996
Are you really a cop?

159
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,422
What did we say?
Cooperate, or you'll get hurt.

160
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,392
How old are you?

161
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,353
What's it to you?

162
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,313
I'm just glad to see you.

163
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:42,107
Kids your age have all but disappeared.

164
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,026
Please go away. You smell foul.

165
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,111
Let's go.

166
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,115
This crazy bitch.

167
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,117
-That bastard.
-What did you say?

168
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,786
Stop it, you punk!

169
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,496
Seriously.

170
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:56,538
-Grandma!
-You fucker!

171
00:15:58,749 --> 00:15:59,875
Su-na, are you okay?

172
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,398
Hey, hold it.

173
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,316
Go.

174
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,651
Move.

175
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,157
What the fuck are you doing?

176
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,720
Die!

177
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:55,806
That tickles.

178
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,319
Are you the boss?

179
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,822
No, I'm not the boss, sir.

180
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,073
Then who's your boss?

181
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,326
Well, it's Tiger, sir.

182
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,454
Tiger? That prick is still alive?

183
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,711
Hey, where did you get this water?

184
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,504
From the apartment, sir.

185
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,131
-Apartment?
-Yes, sir.

186
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,842
I've gone far beyond this area
but never seen apartments.

187
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:32,926
I'm not lying, sir.

188
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,762
It's quite far from here,

189
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:38,640
surrounded by unusual terrain,
so it's rather hard to see.

190
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,559
There's clean water there, sir.

191
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:44,271
Listen, if you ever come here again,
I'll kill you all. Got it?

192
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,773
Yes, sir. I understand.

193
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,357
Make sure you tell Tiger.

194
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,275
Yes, sir.

195
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,740
But who should I say you are?

196
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,534
Nam San.

197
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,953
Oh, you're the Nam San.

198
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,748
Yes, sir. I understand.

199
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,291
Hey, get up.

200
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,751
I'm so sorry, sir.

201
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,086
Hurry up!

202
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,928
Are you okay? And you, ma'am?

203
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,638
I'm fine. How about you?

204
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,182
I'm all right.

205
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,025
You're cute.

206
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:36,990
Nam San.

207
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,753
You know, all that talk earlier
might not have been complete bullshit.

208
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:50,921
What talk?

209
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:56,093
Well, that prick said
he got that water from an apartment.

210
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:02,141
Apparently, the place really exists.
People are dying to go there.

211
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,395
I heard it's packed with people
and practically heaven on earth.

212
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,775
You should go if you want.

213
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,735
I'm just curious. That's all.

214
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:17,406
Besides, you don't get to just go there.

215
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,491
Only the chosen ones get to enter.

216
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,080
Who are those punks?

217
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,211
Su-na!

218
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:32,588
Hey.

219
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,339
Who are you guys?

220
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,428
It's fine. They're not bad people.

221
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,139
It's really okay, mister.

222
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:43,891
She's a teacher.

223
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:45,559
What teacher?

224
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,061
Hello. Nice to meet you.

225
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:51,481
We happen to have
a safe place set up in Seoul.

226
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,401
I'm a teacher
and the leader of a volunteer group there.

227
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,904
They must be from the place
I mentioned earlier.

228
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,740
But why us?

229
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:05,370
We're prioritizing the protection
of families with children in their teens.

230
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,457
We believe we must protect our youth
for humanity's future.

231
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,335
Su-na, if you come with us,

232
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:14,588
your grandmother will live
a long, healthy life.

233
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,507
We have clean water and food
ready for you.

234
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,301
Clean water?

235
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,137
Oh my, thank the Lord.

236
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,098
Such an amazing place
must be a target of gangs.

237
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,392
How will you ensure safety?

238
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:33,273
We have an armed security force
with ex-military personnel.

239
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:36,401
Gangs roaming the wastelands
wouldn't dare make a move on us.

240
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,696
Could these two join us as well?

241
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,115
They're like family to me.

242
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,033
I'm sorry.

243
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,662
We're only accepting immediate family.

244
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,498
Ma'am,

245
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,625
have you not decided yet?

246
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,545
I hope you can make the right decision
for Su-na's sake.

247
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:59,132
If you pass on this,
other children may take the spot.

248
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:04,096
Well, my grandma's rather unwell,
so she won't be able to walk for too long.

249
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,306
We have medical staff at the halfway point

250
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:10,269
to ensure the safe transport
of those with health issues.

251
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,688
She's right. Let's go, Su-na.

252
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,773
Anywhere should be better than here.

253
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,442
That's right.
You should live in a better place.

254
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,615
I'll come to see you.

255
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,537
Okay.

256
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,997
You too, mister.

257
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,623
Please come to see me.

258
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,208
Yes, I'll do that.

259
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,128
Just a second, Grandma.

260
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:38,922
Mr. Nam San.

261
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,426
Thank you for all your help.

262
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,594
Don't mention it. Take care, ma'am.

263
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,306
Keep well, ma'am.

264
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,735
It's just a practice sketch.

265
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,612
Thank you.

266
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:09,077
It'll be hard to walk once the sun sets.
Let's hurry now.

267
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,287
Oh, okay.

268
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:11,872
-Grandma.
-Okay.

269
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,517
When did she get such a good look at me?

270
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:40,901
Su-na definitely has a crush on me, right?

271
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,402
As if.

272
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:48,408
What joy is there in life
now that Su-na has left us?

273
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,786
This place is too dangerous
for Su-na to live.

274
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,955
Events like today's happen far too often.

275
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,251
Well, you could keep her safe
in the future, like today.

276
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,339
Me, protect someone?

277
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,132
I couldn't even keep my own daughter safe.

278
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,884
Jeez.

279
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,220
You're at it again.

280
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,855
But Su-na sure does look
a lot like your daughter.

281
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,901
Wait!

282
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:27,572
If you get married and adopt me,
wouldn't we also get into that apartment?

283
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:28,573
Right?

284
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,450
How about the lady covered in gold?

285
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,369
-Hey.
-I'm dead serious.

286
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:35,205
The world might've ended,
but I can't just give up on life.

287
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,792
-My love just wasn't meant to be.
-Jesus Christ.

288
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:42,129
A loving married couple resemble
each other. You two already look alike.

289
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,172
Besides, she'd look stunning with makeup.

290
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,467
Hey, she put the snake in her nose.
Who does that?

291
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,344
That's enough, okay? Enough.

292
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,310
Going somewhere?

293
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,355
You're blabbering too much. I'm going out.

294
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:01,773
On a night hunt?

295
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,067
-Yeah.
-Let me come with you.

296
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,078
Grandma, are you okay?

297
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,164
Yes, I'm all right.

298
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,207
-Don't mind me.
-Mind your step.

299
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,646
Don't worry.
They're from our volunteer group.

300
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,356
Oh, right.

301
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,418
They're families from the west.

302
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,961
Thank you for your hard work.

303
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,881
Thank you all for coming this far.

304
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,090
Nice to meet you.

305
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,302
Follow me carefully this way, please.

306
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:26,441
I'm Lee Ju-ye. I'm 18. You?

307
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,988
I'm Han Su-na. I'm also 18.

308
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,406
Really? Wanna be friends?

309
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,118
Sure, let's be friends.

310
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,622
I haven't met a friend my age
in a really long time.

311
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,540
Same.

312
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:45,043
There wasn't anyone my age
in my neighborhood either.

313
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,337
Where did you live?

314
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:51,800
I lived in a tent
near Bus District with Grandma.

315
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,928
Nice to meet you, Ju-ye.

316
00:25:56,346 --> 00:26:00,141
My parents made me live underground
because it wasn't safe outside.

317
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,852
That must've been rough.

318
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,397
Most of it was bearable,

319
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:09,776
but the bugs and rats
would crawl up my body.

320
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,154
I had to keep moving my arms and legs

321
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,908
in case they mistook me for a corpse
and tore into me.

322
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:22,956
At least we can put that kind of life
behind us now.

323
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,500
Yeah, I heard the place is amazing.

324
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,044
I'll take a shower as soon as I get there.

325
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,505
It still feels like
the bugs are on my skin.

326
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,264
I wonder if Su-na's there yet.

327
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,183
I wish I could go there with Su-na.

328
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:48,023
Man, I really don't want to let her go.

329
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,400
We can just go see her.

330
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,318
Nope.

331
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:53,570
That lady in gold.

332
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,740
The stepmom I'd really like.

333
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,410
Hey, okay. I won't.

334
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,203
Careful.

335
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,377
Grandma, are you all right?

336
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,214
Let's stop for a moment.

337
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,343
Let's take Su-na's grandmother

338
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:20,305
and your father to the medical station
I mentioned earlier.

339
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:24,643
It's dangerous terrain from here on.
We wouldn't want you to strain yourselves.

340
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:28,355
Mr. Oh and Mr. Choi here
are going to take you there.

341
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,606
Thank you.

342
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:32,692
Thank you so much
for taking such good care of us.

343
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:36,738
Please take good care of my grandma.

344
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,948
Of course. You don't have to worry.

345
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:41,826
Mr. Choi.

346
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,328
I'll take good care of her.

347
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,584
-I'll take him from here.
-Thank you.

348
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,294
Slowly.

349
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,421
Father, I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

350
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,592
All right, let's be off now, then.

351
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,933
Su-na, don't worry about me
and go on ahead.

352
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:20,990
Idiot.

353
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,450
Nothing here.

354
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,993
Let's just check our snare trap.

355
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:26,287
Okay.

356
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,554
These are our vehicles.

357
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:45,890
We can take the cars from here.

358
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,350
Excuse me.

359
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:52,313
If the cars were this close,
we could have taken my grandma with us.

360
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,940
We can wait, then.

361
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,902
Everyone walked all night.
A few more hours of waiting won't hurt.

362
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,739
Right, everyone?

363
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,408
Mom, I'm thirsty.

364
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,160
We don't have any water.

365
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,703
Hang in there.

366
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,623
Oh my, what do we do?

367
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:14,669
We'll send a car back here tomorrow.

368
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,296
Please don't worry.

369
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,132
Let's get going, everyone.

370
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:20,759
Get in, everyone.

371
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,430
-Thank you.
-Sure.

372
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,724
Oh my, you must be exhausted.

373
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:35,106
Don't worry too much about your grandma.
I'm sure she'll be fine.

374
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,275
Get a head count.

375
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:52,874
There are still people doing
such good things these days.

376
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:56,294
Goodness, he's right.
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

377
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,754
Don't mention it.

378
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,507
All right, we've reached our destination.

379
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,145
Where's the medical facility?

380
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:15,563
Down there.

381
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:23,696
Is that Grandma?

382
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,533
Grandma!

383
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,095
Grandma. Wake up, Grandma!

384
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,128
What's with these bastards?

385
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,437
What the hell?

386
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,661
Come at me, dickhead.

387
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:02,879
Why did you kill Grandma?

388
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,214
Useless ones deserve to die.

389
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,258
You fucking son of a bitch!

390
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,262
Su-na. Where is she?

391
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,077
Just die!

392
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:47,840
Ji-wan!

393
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,886
Who the hell are you?

394
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,778
San, we have to go now.
Su-na is in danger.

395
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:11,280
Calm down. Let's clean this place first.

396
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,616
Are you leaving Grandma like that?

397
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,690
We're almost there, everyone.

398
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,650
Please pack your personal belongings.

399
00:33:58,327 --> 00:33:59,620
You came here to see me?

400
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,417
Yes, I need your help.

401
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,628
I must save the apartment's residents
and my subordinates.

402
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,631
So why did you come to us for help?

403
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,092
Also, what's with these bastards?
And the apartment?

404
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,927
Hey, you stay out of this.

405
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,221
Help me, please.

406
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:23,895
They didn't seem human.
Chopping their heads off will kill them?

407
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:24,896
That's right.

408
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:28,983
What are these things?

409
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,030
My name is Lee Eun-ho.

410
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:36,741
I was a sergeant
in a CCU Air Force special ops unit.

411
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,788
-Heading down to find survivors.
-Yes, sir.

412
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,548
We were watching from the sky
on the day of the great earthquake.

413
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:58,471
During our search for survivors, we found
an apartment that hadn't collapsed.

414
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,017
Our unit struck an aquifer there.

415
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:07,230
And with the survivors,
we did our best to rebuild the apartment.

416
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:10,399
But one day,

417
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,402
this man came to us.

418
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,197
Yang Gi-su.

419
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,783
The only doctor who survived.

420
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,702
He was helpful as a doctor,

421
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,623
but one day, he showed his true colors.

422
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,378
Dr. Yang, I came to check something.

423
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,547
Some parents have complained.

424
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,924
Their children never came back
after you took them.

425
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,884
What's going on?

426
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,305
Lee Eun-ho,
what do you think you're doing?

427
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,349
Hurry up and explain.

428
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,434
Sergeant Kwon.

429
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,188
Don't you think it's time
for Sergeant Lee to know too?

430
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:53,109
Eun-ho, there's no hope in this world.

431
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,570
Now we mustâ€¦

432
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,407
put our faith in Dr. Yang.

433
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,200
I merely gave him some advice,

434
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,870
along with a little gift.

435
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,921
-What are you doing now?
-Take a look.

436
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,299
This is Dr. Yang's latest breakthrough.

437
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,400
Sergeant Lee Eun-ho?

438
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,110
Look at me.

439
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:40,615
I mean, how do you think
someone like me managed to survive

440
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,825
that horrible great earthquake.

441
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:47,163
I once went two or three months
without any water.

442
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,166
I am the future of humanity.

443
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:53,836
This apartment won't last long anyway.
Everyone's going to die.

444
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,172
Failure to embrace change
means everyone dies.

445
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,176
I'll help you survive.

446
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,637
You crazy bastard.

447
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:04,972
Where are the children?

448
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,349
-Take her away.
-Where?!

449
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,308
Calm down.

450
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:10,186
Let me go, you bastard!

451
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,485
Hey, Lee Eun-ho!

452
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:28,829
It seems Yang Gi-su has been conducting
strange experiments on people.

453
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:32,166
They ended up that way
because of the experiments.

454
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,001
-If you help me--
-Hey.

455
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,755
I'm going to go get Su-na now.

456
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,343
If you get in my way,
I'm going to kill you first.

457
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:43,928
Got it?

458
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:58,150
Our apartment has over 30 families
residing in it,

459
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:01,862
and it can provide them with electricity
with the solar panels we set up.

460
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,785
LET US FORGE A NEW FUTURE

461
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,330
Is that lettuce?

462
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,540
I see tomatoes too.

463
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,338
WELCOME, NEW RESIDENTS

464
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,173
WELCOME TO THE FUTURE OF NEW HUMANITY

465
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,217
Please make way.

466
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,806
Dr. Yang Gi-su is coming out.

467
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,272
Hello, everyone.

468
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:39,525
My name is Yang Gi-su,
and I'm in charge of this place.

469
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,572
Welcome, everyone.

470
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:49,577
You must've endured
numerous hardships out there

471
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,872
where conditions were truly dreadful.

472
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:57,001
You all went through so much out there
where countless barbarians roamed freely.

473
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,670
But you don't need to worry anymore.

474
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:04,800
We will be providing you
with clean water and food,

475
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:08,512
and we will keep you safe
from outside threats.

476
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,267
Right. Get them some water first.

477
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:19,190
That's clean water we purified
in this apartment.

478
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,573
My grandma should be arriving soon.

479
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:29,325
Can I have one more, please?

480
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:32,536
Thank you.

481
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:15,079
They've been taking children,
just like they took Su-na.

482
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:18,082
They must be the subject
of the experiment.

483
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,917
Those sons of bitches! Damn it!

484
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,753
Let's go. We gotta save Su-na now!

485
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,046
Got a death wish?

486
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,590
Rushing in recklessly won't help.

487
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:30,344
Their security is tighter
than you'd expect.

488
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,139
They shoot trespassers on sight.

489
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:37,351
Come daybreak, I'll take care
of the guards at the main gate

490
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,353
and keep the others distracted.

491
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,606
If you get into the underground prison
and rescue my associates,

492
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,693
we can join forces.

493
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:49,196
You sure we can trust
these associates of yours or whatever?

494
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,159
Again with the disrespectful language,
punk-ass kid.

495
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:54,493
How old are you?

496
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,537
I'm fucking 18, woman.

497
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,372
-You wanna die?
-Damn it. Let go!

498
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,041
Hey, stop it,
or you'll grow to like each other.

499
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,003
Let's think this over.

500
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,393
Amen. Yeah.

501
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,775
Boss, I've taken care of them all.

502
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,029
Hurry up and fight!

503
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,405
Hey, man.

504
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,948
-Go at it.
-Hey.

505
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,330
Wanna see your wife squirt blood all over?

506
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,440
Fuck, we lost again!

507
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,947
Hey, Pung-gi.

508
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,783
Got anything left to wager?

509
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,452
You fat-ass, chrome-dome prick.

510
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,287
There's one left, for fuck's sake.

511
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:34,134
Man, I saved your ass from life in prison,
only to have you disrespect me like this.

512
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,178
-Show some respect, prick.
-Fuck them up!

513
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,060
You motherfucker. Come here.

514
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:45,771
Fuck.

515
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:48,566
Tiger!

516
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,317
What, you bastard?

517
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,490
Hey, fucking kill them all!

518
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:13,757
Everyone stop!

519
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,554
Where's Tiger?

520
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,181
Look who it is.

521
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,142
It's been a while, Nam San.

522
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:26,103
There's that bastard.
Red and plump like a sweet potato.

523
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,730
Sir, that's the bastard.

524
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:28,856
He's a beast.

525
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:32,860
Thanks to you,
I quit boxing and got totally fucked over.

526
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:36,280
I've waited my whole life for this,
and you just walk up to your own grave.

527
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:39,074
I came here to ask you something,
but I changed my mind

528
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,201
since I don't like your attitude.

529
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:44,538
-I'll beat you up like the old days.
-We're not in the ring anymore.

530
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,416
Street fighting is different,
you son of a bitch!

531
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,627
Hey, Pung-gi.

532
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:53,631
If you bring down that gorilla,
I'll give you half my slaves.

533
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:54,548
Half?

534
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:59,219
You're next once I've killed that prick,
you fat bastard.

535
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,971
Kill that gorilla!

536
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,629
That fucker.

537
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:51,397
Hurry! Get out of there!

538
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:10,624
Wait.

539
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,168
Damn. That really hurts.

540
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:19,508
-It hurts so much.
-Get up. Come here.

541
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:21,135
Hey, run!

542
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,136
Hey!

543
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:29,893
Oh God, my chin hurts so badly.

544
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:44,324
Hello.

545
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,911
Could you please tell me
when my grandma will be arriving?

546
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:48,829
Grandma?

547
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,081
Whose grandma?

548
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:55,544
We sent them a ride this morning,
so she should arrive before dinnertime.

549
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:58,756
Don't worry.
Why don't you return to your spot?

550
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:00,883
Okay.

551
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,054
Aren't you trying too hard for a kid?

552
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,348
Children are our hope.

553
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:10,934
We can't let them down.

554
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:16,148
Our hope is Dr. Yang Gi-su, okay?

555
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:27,326
Today is the day we announce
the much-anticipated cumulative grades.

556
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:31,580
First place,

557
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,332
Kim Hak-yong.

558
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,585
Unit 604. Lee Gyu-yeon, Unit 607.

559
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:39,755
Third place. Choi Ju-yeong, Unit 601.

560
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:42,090
Fourth place. Jang Chang-su, Unit 608.

561
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,467
Excuse me.

562
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:47,179
What grades is he talking about?
We're new here.

563
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:49,515
The family of the student who comes first

564
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:53,060
gets assigned
to the nicest apartment unit.

565
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,354
I'm so jealous of you.

566
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,689
My child always comes last.

567
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,234
Family members of the student
with top grades

568
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:03,278
will be exempted from work
and given a free meal pass.

569
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:05,948
Family members of Kim Hak-yong,
please step forward.

570
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,787
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

571
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:13,747
Thank you.

572
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,626
You can also come in first, right?

573
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:18,794
Of course.

574
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:21,672
Students are our hope!

575
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,382
Students are our future!

576
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:27,511
Everyone, please have faith
in your children and cheer them on!

577
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:39,231
All right, it's time to say your goodbyes.

578
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:42,568
As we explained before,
students will live on the eighth floor.

579
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:43,527
-What?
-What?

580
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,071
You never mentioned that.

581
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:49,992
We explained it to your grandmother.
Didn't she tell you?

582
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:55,372
Does that mean
I won't live with my grandma?

583
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,457
Does that mean we can't see Ju-ye?

584
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,837
If you sign up for a meeting,
I'll make sure you get to see her.

585
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,006
Can we see her anytime by signing up?

586
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:04,923
Of course.

587
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:08,594
I'll get going now.
I'll be sure to come first.

588
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,220
Don't skip any meals, okay?

589
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:12,389
-Let's go.
-Look after her.

590
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,309
Right, please take good care of her.

591
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,811
As for the parents, please follow me.

592
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,813
Listen to your brother.
We'll see you soon.

593
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,024
-Okay.
-Seong-won, take good care of Gyu-rin.

594
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:22,941
Okay.

595
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:24,818
This way.

596
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:53,472
This is the clean water
that our children drink.

597
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,392
If you look here,
you'll see the steps we take

598
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:00,812
to filtrate the spoiled water
to make the potable water we drink.

599
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,356
It's the most precious water.

600
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:11,156
San, they even have guns here.

601
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:12,741
Right.

602
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:18,121
Hey, where did you guys get
these guns and water?

603
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:21,500
You got them
from the apartment, didn't you?

604
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:26,588
-You don't know?
-Well, do we know where we got it?

605
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:27,506
What?

606
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,133
So, do you know?

607
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,135
I don't know. Not me.

608
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,595
Okay. Take a nap, then.

609
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:38,558
What about you?

610
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,477
-I don't exactlyâ€¦
-Lights out.

611
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,314
-You? You don't know, do you?
-No.

612
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,483
What about you?

613
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,193
You don't know.

614
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:53,156
What about you? Do you know? You don't?

615
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:58,662
You don't know anything.

616
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:00,080
-I actually do.
-You don't.

617
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:04,126
I'm the only one who goes to make deals.
You're going to need me, sir.

618
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,266
Excuse me.

619
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:22,310
Do we have to do this work every day?

620
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,440
This is what we do all day.

621
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,867
They have a monopoly on all the water.

622
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,493
Really clean water at that.

623
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:39,953
They have a monopoly on it?

624
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,205
Yes, and with that comes power.

625
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,207
All they have to do is sit on their asses

626
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:47,419
while gangs like us
bring goods to them for some water.

627
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:48,920
And what do you bring them?

628
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,338
People.

629
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:53,050
At first, they were fine with us
bringing in anyone,

630
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:55,886
but now they only want us
to bring in children.

631
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,554
-Kids in their teens.
-Why children?

632
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,139
Well, I don't know about that.

633
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,932
And you still sold people to them?

634
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,184
-Hey.
-What theâ€¦?

635
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:03,810
-Hold up.
-Come on, relax.

636
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,270
When you came to Bus District

637
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:08,190
and tried to fucking take Su-na,
that was why?

638
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:10,358
-Yeah.
-You son of a bitch.

639
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,359
Hey, relax.

640
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,612
Hey, pals. Why are you so hotheaded?

641
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:15,822
-Hey, let it go.
-Let me go, okay?

642
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,616
There, there. Let it go.

643
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:19,326
We had to make a living too.

644
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:22,329
So? How do you guys enter the premises?

645
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,413
Weâ€¦

646
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:27,250
can only enter on delivery days.

647
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,919
The days we deliver the goods.

648
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:29,836
Delivery days?

649
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,339
All right, you must be tired talking.
Take a nap.

650
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:35,884
Well, I'm actually not that tired.

651
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:36,927
Nah, take a nap.

652
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:46,353
Mr. Choi took care
of the children's elderly guardians.

653
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:50,107
The new children, both 18-year-old girls,
are Han Su-na and Lee Ju-ye.

654
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:54,820
With our two new recruits,
we have a total of 19.

655
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:57,280
They're a lot healthier than we expected.

656
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,866
-I see. Please keep a close eye on them.
-Okay.

657
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,954
They probably didn't drink clean water
for a while. You know what to do.

658
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:05,455
I'll have everything ready.

659
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,166
I'll visit them this evening.

660
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,084
You can go now.

661
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,462
You should wipe your face.

662
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:13,672
Just go.

663
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,517
Hello, everyone.

664
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:29,896
Here. Come this way.

665
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,065
Stand here.

666
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,734
Attention. Bow.

667
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,403
Nice to meet you.

668
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,867
All right, everyone.
Today, we have new friends joining us.

669
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:45,287
-Introduce yourself first, Ju-ye.
-Okay.

670
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,123
My name is Lee Ju-ye.

671
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:52,794
I'm 18, and I like eating.

672
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,963
I don't like bugs.

673
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:56,173
Nice to meet you all.

674
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:59,384
Wow, let's give her a hand.
It's so nice to have you.

675
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:00,594
And you, Su-na.

676
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:04,681
Su-na?

677
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:08,894
Don't be nervous. Just talk comfortably.

678
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:15,901
My name is Han Su-na.

679
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:19,112
I like drawing, and I don't likeâ€¦

680
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:22,240
communal life.

681
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:26,912
Wow, let's give her a round of applause!

682
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:30,248
You can go sit
in those empty seats over there.

683
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:31,458
-Okay.
-Off you go.

684
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:34,336
Hello.

685
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:37,881
All right, today,

686
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:41,384
we'll be learning
about the purposes of metabolic changes.

687
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:43,053
Open your books.

688
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:47,098
Let's first discuss
the current human body structure.

689
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:50,393
Our physical limitations
meant we had to drink water

690
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,687
and consume food in order to survive,

691
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:57,817
so we've wasted so many resources
on people who were of no help.

692
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,238
These are known weaknesses.

693
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:03,865
And with a shortage of water
in our current world,

694
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:08,328
humanity needs a new body structure
that can overcome these weaknesses.

695
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,165
Our goal is to come up
with a new metabolic system,

696
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,417
allowing us to create a breed of humanity

697
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:18,338
capable of surviving for a long time
without water and sustenance.

698
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:21,299
We aim to increase
the gradually declining human population

699
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:26,513
so that we can open up the possibility
of returning to a civilized society.

700
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:30,350
Therefore, with both water and food
scarce in this world,

701
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:34,187
you must never forget
Dr. Yang Gi-su's mercy

702
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:37,107
and do your duty.

703
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:41,403
Once we improve our metabolic systems
through Dr. Yang's research,

704
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:46,825
humanity will finally be given a body
that can adapt to this new world.

705
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,743
Focus, Su-na.

706
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,748
I don't understand.

707
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,793
People outside don't even have
enough water to drink,

708
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:59,337
but people here drink freely
and even take showers.

709
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:02,507
Everyone here goes on and on
about Dr. Yang Gi-su,

710
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:07,304
but why won't Dr. Yang Gi-su
share water with those people?

711
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:14,602
Su-na.

712
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:17,314
The outside world is full of barbarians.

713
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:21,401
Dr. Yang lost his beloved daughter
because of people like that.

714
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:25,572
To be a part of the new humanity,

715
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:29,117
you need the right qualifications.

716
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:32,954
What kind of qualifications are needed?

717
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:37,000
People that help
with the doctor's research.

718
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:39,711
I'd also like to help
with the doctor's research.

719
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:45,717
It seems you have what it takes, Ju-ye.

720
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,678
Please help Su-na understand, Ju-ye.

721
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,013
Yes, ma'am.

722
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:52,724
Now, for our next lesson,

723
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:55,935
we'll learn about organisms
that excel at survival.

724
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,272
Dr. Yang will be visiting us later on,

725
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:04,986
so let's all express our gratitude
by giving him a hearty welcome.

726
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,738
Yes, ma'am.

727
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:16,748
You know this food comes
from your parents' hard work, right?

728
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,667
Let us all dig in with a thankful heart.

729
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,754
And there's water,
the world's most precious thing.

730
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:25,507
Make sure to drink it all down
to the very last drop.

731
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:31,304
Dr. Yang Gi-su had them
specially purified for you all.

732
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:33,890
Ju-ye.

733
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,893
Hello, everyone.

734
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:38,812
A round of applause, everyone.

735
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:42,607
Attention. Bow.

736
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:47,320
"Students are our hope."

737
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,572
Surely you know our apartment's motto.

738
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:53,952
That's why we're supplying our students
with special food and water.

739
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:58,873
As you know, we live in a world
with a great shortage of food and water.

740
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:03,044
I'm working day and night
in order to create a world

741
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:07,549
in which we'll be able to survive
on only a small amount of food and water.

742
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:10,927
Until that day comes,
please make sure to finish everything

743
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,471
and not leave any precious food or water.

744
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:14,514
Yes, sir.

745
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:16,933
-Yes?
-Doctor.

746
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:18,810
Oh, there?

747
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:21,855
-Her name is?
-It's Lee Ju-ye.

748
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,607
-Lee Ju-ye.
-Yes, sir.

749
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:28,653
-Eighteen years old?
-Yes, sir.

750
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,406
I heard that you wanted
to help in my research.

751
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:35,326
Let's have a consultation
right away today.

752
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,786
-Right. Of course.
-Okay.

753
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,289
Why don't we have you eat first?

754
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:44,252
I'll send someone over in three hours,
so come to my lab.

755
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:45,753
Thank you, Doctor.

756
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,174
-Right.
-Let's go.

757
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:51,426
Excuse me.

758
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:56,097
Has my grandmother arrived?

759
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,975
She has. Don't worry.

760
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:02,312
Let me see her, then.

761
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:08,401
Ms. Kim.

762
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,654
Haven't you explained it to her yet?

763
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:14,199
I'm sorry, sir.

764
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:18,453
Su-na.

765
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:23,041
Your grandmother's a lot sicker
than we expected,

766
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:25,543
so she'll need to be treated
for two to three days.

767
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:28,129
Is Grandma that unwell?

768
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,759
She just needs some rest.

769
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:34,928
You'll be able to see her in a day or so.

770
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:38,932
Dr. Yang Gi-su
is personally treating her, so don't--

771
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:43,269
I'm personally taking care of her,
so she will be a lot better.

772
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:46,064
So don't you worry about a thing. Andâ€¦

773
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:47,398
She's Su-na.

774
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:51,236
Su-na, you're terribly malnourished
right now, okay?

775
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:54,072
So eat well and regain your health.

776
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:55,615
Here.

777
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:12,340
All right, enjoy your dinners.

778
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:16,636
And don't forget that you are our future.

779
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,711
-All right. Wrap it up.
-Yes, sir.

780
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:52,505
It's been over 20 hours.

781
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:55,049
Sergeants Choi and Oh haven't returned.

782
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:57,302
Further delays could be dangerous.

783
00:59:58,803 --> 00:59:59,971
It's fine. For now.

784
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:05,852
Maybe we should hand out personal syringes
for situations like this.

785
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:10,148
It's too dangerous
for an individual to carry yet.

786
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:13,776
Besides, there's no telling
what kind of side effects we'll see.

787
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,321
How long do we have to subsist
on these injections?

788
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:20,366
We're running out of children to bring.

789
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:23,661
We're almost there.

790
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:26,706
Just hang in there.

791
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:30,793
Get back to work now.

792
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,380
All they care about is themselves.

793
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:37,133
Human dignity? A thing of the past!

794
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:44,223
My research must see fruition
as soon as possible

795
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,518
so we can dream of a more meaningful life.

796
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:53,983
And when that day comes,
people will accept and value

797
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:56,944
the sacrifices of the evolutionary rejects
as necessities.

798
01:00:58,237 --> 01:00:59,781
That day will come, won't it?

799
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:37,652
It's time to change shifts.

800
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:50,248
Excuse me.

801
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:55,128
We applied for a meeting
with our child earlier.

802
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:56,796
Where can we meet her?

803
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,631
A meeting? What meeting?

804
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:02,635
The teacher said we could see our daughter
once our daily shift was over.

805
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:05,138
There's no such policy here.

806
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:07,181
She definitely told us earlier.

807
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:10,393
If Ju-ye can't visit here,
we'll go to her.

808
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:14,105
The eighth floor is off-limits
to regular residents. You can't go there.

809
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:16,315
Well, where's the teacher?

810
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:19,569
No, you know what? Where's my daughter?

811
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:22,321
What do you mean
we can't go see our child?

812
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,281
It was agreed!

813
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:26,242
-They can't see their kids.
-I hope ours are okay.

814
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:28,035
Don't mind us. Change shifts.

815
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:31,330
Let's talk tomorrow.

816
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:33,291
Hey, wait. Where is our daughter?

817
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,794
Where is she, you bastards?

818
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:04,989
How many times have I told you
not to interrupt while I'm experimenting?

819
01:03:05,072 --> 01:03:07,492
Sorry, sir. Too many witnesses
made it hard to manage.

820
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:09,535
After all it took us to get these kids.

821
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:20,129
They're in the purification facility?

822
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:24,550
Sergeant Kang, please go upstairs
and prepare the drugs and catheter.

823
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:25,551
Yes, sir.

824
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,698
Fuck me, this is so embarrassing.

825
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:54,872
Let me see my daughter!

826
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:56,749
Why would you lie to us? Why?

827
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,544
The teacher told us
we could see her tonight!

828
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:00,795
Go check with her.

829
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:02,547
-Please calm down.
-Ask her.

830
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,382
Please let go. Where's the teacher?

831
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:06,217
Why do you keep lying to us?

832
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:07,635
What's all this, then?

833
01:04:07,718 --> 01:04:09,470
What's going on here?

834
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:11,848
Doctor, where is Ju-ye?

835
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:15,726
You said we could see her!
You can't go back on something like that!

836
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:18,771
Sir, Ju-ye's doing fine.

837
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,231
She's doing great.

838
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:22,483
Doctor, please let us see Ju-ye.

839
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:25,236
Come on, don't be like this.

840
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:27,446
Please settle down.

841
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:32,285
Fine. Why don't we all go to my lab?

842
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:34,328
I'll let you see Ju-ye.

843
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:37,832
Let's go. Okay?

844
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:40,877
Let's go.

845
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:20,333
REPTILE REGENERATION EXPERIMENT

846
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:28,299
EXPERIMENTED ON FIVE SOLDIERS

847
01:05:34,388 --> 01:05:37,892
SEVEN 10-YEAR-OLDS, ALL DEAD
FOUR 17-YEAR-OLDS, ALL DEAD

848
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:53,658
Ju-ye.

849
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:55,159
Ju-ye.

850
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:03,501
Come this way.

851
01:06:05,836 --> 01:06:08,130
So, is our daughter here?

852
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:10,257
Why wouldâ€¦

853
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:13,344
See? Your daughter's fine.

854
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:16,055
-Ju-ye!
-Ju-ye!

855
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:18,432
Now, please don't stimulate Ju-ye!

856
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:20,267
It'll put her life at risk.

857
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,895
Ju-ye is a valuable asset
to our apartment,

858
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,855
performing her duties admirably.

859
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:27,233
Doctor, what is all this?

860
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,318
Is Ju-ye sick or something?

861
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,611
No, she's not sick.

862
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:33,322
Kids her age
have something special right here.

863
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:36,701
"Children are our hope."
You know our apartment's motto, right?

864
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:42,248
Now, look. This is my daughter.

865
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:44,625
Everyone said she was dead,
but I brought her back.

866
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:47,128
I've essentially created
an immortal human.

867
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:57,888
What?

868
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:03,602
The birth of a new humanity
rests on your daughter's shoulders.

869
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:07,398
Do you now understand the significant role
she plays in my research?

870
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:09,275
Ju-ye!

871
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:12,737
Hold on!
I told you not to stimulate your daughter!

872
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:15,656
I told you not to touch her!
For goodness' sake!

873
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:19,118
-What's wrong with Ju-ye?
-Jesus!

874
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:22,038
What's wrong with our daughter?!
What's wrong?!

875
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:24,040
-Ju-ye!
-I told you not to touch her!

876
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,544
Oh God, do something!

877
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:31,213
Do something!

878
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:35,551
What's wrong with her?!

879
01:07:35,634 --> 01:07:37,136
What's wrong with Ju-ye?!

880
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:47,855
What's wrong with you, Ju-ye?

881
01:07:47,938 --> 01:07:49,982
-Is our daughter dead?
-Wake up.

882
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:51,901
Ju-ye.

883
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:54,653
I was away for too long.

884
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:57,323
I told you not to interrupt!

885
01:07:57,406 --> 01:07:59,158
-Ju-ye.
-Ju-ye?

886
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:00,493
Ju-ye!

887
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:01,952
-Look what happened.
-Ju-ye!

888
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:12,338
You have no idea
how important this research is, do you?

889
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:17,843
I fed you
and provided you with shelter, didn't I?

890
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:20,471
But you couldn't stand it?!

891
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:57,842
Send the cleanup crew to the lab.

892
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:10,312
Su-na, what are you doing here?

893
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:14,942
Great timing.

894
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:23,909
Thank you for coming with me.

895
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:28,539
I'm so grateful
to have met such good people.

896
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:31,125
I'm just here to bring Su-na back.

897
01:09:32,626 --> 01:09:33,460
Besides,

898
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:36,505
he won't stop whining
without Su-na around.

899
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:41,177
I'm not a good person.

900
01:09:43,053 --> 01:09:44,972
There's a lot of blood on my hands.

901
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:50,102
Morning's here.

902
01:09:50,936 --> 01:09:52,146
Get up, Ji-wan.

903
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:54,857
We're leaving already?

904
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:13,167
It must be nice to be so young.

905
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:17,421
The drugs work great on you,
and you don't even have side effects.

906
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:20,466
I know why you need all those children.

907
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:23,886
You're using us as lab rats
just so you can survive.

908
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:26,138
Don't worry.

909
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,474
I won't let you die so easily.

910
01:10:29,516 --> 01:10:31,268
Our survival depends on children.

911
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:34,355
We sometimes encounter hiccups,
like with Ju-ye.

912
01:10:34,438 --> 01:10:36,732
What the hell are you doing
to the kids' heads?

913
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:41,070
At your age, the pituitary glands
contain something vital to my research.

914
01:10:42,029 --> 01:10:44,782
Of course, I need to tweak it a bit
before I can use it.

915
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:48,994
You know the water you drink
in the classroom? That does the trick.

916
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:50,329
Isn't it amazing

917
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:53,040
that we can achieve it
with just some drinking water?

918
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:56,418
What about my grandma?

919
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:01,340
You seriously believed
there was a medical facility?

920
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,594
The weak among us must be weeded out

921
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:07,930
for a new humanity to arise.

922
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:10,683
Stay still.

923
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:21,944
Hey, don't screw up.

924
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:23,237
Just trust me, sir.

925
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:31,203
-How've you been?
-What's with your face?

926
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:36,000
A few days ago, I got into a fight
with some crazy gorilla bastard.

927
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:38,210
What brings you here?

928
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:40,212
I came to deliver the goods.

929
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:42,756
I told you to only come on delivery days.

930
01:11:43,924 --> 01:11:44,842
Damn it.

931
01:11:46,176 --> 01:11:48,304
Well, you know, I was just passing by,

932
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:51,807
so I thought I'd make a delivery
and catch up with you.

933
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:54,476
Get that out of my face.

934
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,228
-Check the back.
-Yes, sir.

935
01:11:58,105 --> 01:11:59,106
Shut off the engine.

936
01:12:13,787 --> 01:12:14,747
What's going on?

937
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:27,301
Hold tight, everyone!

938
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:34,933
Slow down!

939
01:12:37,394 --> 01:12:38,270
No!

940
01:12:47,821 --> 01:12:49,615
Hey, you son of a bitch!

941
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:16,642
Crazy bastard! You're mad!

942
01:13:24,983 --> 01:13:26,193
Ji-wan!

943
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:35,202
We saw those people
when we went to pick Su-na up.

944
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:36,829
Inform the doctor.

945
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:37,746
Okay.

946
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,667
Sergeant Lee will go to the prison.

947
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,043
Don't follow her inside.

948
01:13:43,877 --> 01:13:45,254
I've prepared a gift for her.

949
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:56,807
Move in, hurry!

950
01:14:01,895 --> 01:14:03,689
Please don't kill me. I'm sorry!

951
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:10,612
You don't have to shoot me too.

952
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:12,781
This way.

953
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,536
Fuck, thank God I didn't get shot.

954
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,415
Try to relax, Su-na.

955
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:26,837
What is it now?

956
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,172
Dr. Yang.

957
01:14:28,255 --> 01:14:30,424
I'm sorry, but this is urgent.

958
01:14:31,049 --> 01:14:34,845
Sergeant Lee is with two of the hunters
from Su-na's village.

959
01:14:34,928 --> 01:14:37,306
I'm sure Sergeant Kwon
will take care of it.

960
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,191
I guess your friends are here
to see you, Su-na.

961
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:50,611
I doubt you'll see them.

962
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:11,048
-You sure it's this way?
-Yes, I'm sure.

963
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:18,430
Then why aren't they on our tail?

964
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:49,795
Guys, it's me. Are you all right?

965
01:15:52,839 --> 01:15:53,840
San!

966
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:55,342
Hey!

967
01:15:56,969 --> 01:15:57,803
Get up.

968
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:06,228
Your subordinates
don't seem too fond of us.

969
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:09,773
Hey, get a grip.

970
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:11,942
These things aren't human.

971
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:53,483
Snap out of it!

972
01:17:54,044 --> 01:17:55,629
You guys still alive?

973
01:17:58,256 --> 01:18:00,342
What were these monsters anyway?

974
01:18:00,967 --> 01:18:03,637
The operation's a bust.

975
01:18:04,805 --> 01:18:05,681
I'm sorry.

976
01:18:08,642 --> 01:18:12,896
To all residents of the apartment,
as you know, intruders are threatening

977
01:18:12,979 --> 01:18:16,066
the safety of our apartment
and its residents.

978
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:18,360
Please stay in your homes.

979
01:18:18,443 --> 01:18:21,029
Do not leave your homes
under any circumstances.

980
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:22,614
We've enhanced security

981
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:26,993
in the classrooms and student dorms,
so don't step outside no matter what.

982
01:18:27,077 --> 01:18:28,537
Lastly,

983
01:18:29,329 --> 01:18:32,749
I'd like to inform our intruders
in the basement level,

984
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:36,169
Sergeant Lee Eun-ho and the hunter person,

985
01:18:36,753 --> 01:18:39,589
that you won't be able
to achieve your goals,

986
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:41,174
so give up and leave now.

987
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:44,970
Then I'll spare your lives.

988
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:46,555
That fucking prick.

989
01:18:46,638 --> 01:18:49,850
I'm giving you one last chance.

990
01:18:49,933 --> 01:18:53,562
There's an intercom in the basement.
Press the button and give me an answer.

991
01:18:54,271 --> 01:18:56,857
If you'd like to walk away alive,
that's number one.

992
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:59,860
Or if you'd like to be trapped forever
in the basement,

993
01:18:59,943 --> 01:19:00,944
that's number two!

994
01:19:02,362 --> 01:19:03,864
We pick one.

995
01:19:05,657 --> 01:19:08,034
But we'll be taking Su-na.

996
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:14,958
Let's go get Su-na.

997
01:19:18,545 --> 01:19:19,629
You're coming, right?

998
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:27,429
Sergeant Kwon.

999
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:30,807
Do not let them up to my room,
no matter what.

1000
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:31,892
I understand, sir.

1001
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:35,604
Team A, to the stairs,
and Team B, to the basement.

1002
01:19:35,687 --> 01:19:38,732
I'll take the center.
Don't let them come up, no matter what.

1003
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:43,945
Pray that your friends
don't interrupt this experiment, okay?

1004
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:46,490
If you also end up dying,

1005
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,159
we have no one left to take your place.

1006
01:19:50,368 --> 01:19:52,954
So, hang in there, okay?

1007
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:01,338
What do we do?

1008
01:20:01,421 --> 01:20:02,756
We're almost out of ammo.

1009
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:27,864
Hey, grab their weapons.

1010
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,376
Go find Su-na. I'll handle things here.

1011
01:20:39,459 --> 01:20:41,127
-Will you be okay?
-Just go.

1012
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:42,254
Be careful.

1013
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:00,480
Damn it.

1014
01:21:01,773 --> 01:21:03,400
Where is it? Damn it.

1015
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:05,193
Hey, Ji-wan!

1016
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:06,838
What's going on?

1017
01:22:32,989 --> 01:22:34,324
Let's go up.

1018
01:22:35,867 --> 01:22:36,826
Keep up, Eun-ho!

1019
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:44,167
Keep going up.

1020
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:45,627
-What about you?
-Just go!

1021
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:14,990
Lee Eun-ho.

1022
01:23:17,867 --> 01:23:20,912
Please don't kill us. We're just workers!

1023
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:27,711
I'm looking for a kid named Su-na.

1024
01:23:28,378 --> 01:23:29,963
Where are the new kids?

1025
01:23:31,297 --> 01:23:33,675
The children are all on the eighth floor.

1026
01:23:45,395 --> 01:23:47,856
You guys should also hurry
and find your children.

1027
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:53,111
Lee Eun-ho.

1028
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:58,199
You're still too busy helping others
to find a way out for yourself.

1029
01:24:28,521 --> 01:24:29,355
Su-na.

1030
01:24:30,523 --> 01:24:32,984
Don't shoot. Why are you doing this?

1031
01:24:41,743 --> 01:24:42,619
Oh God, my knees.

1032
01:25:01,054 --> 01:25:02,972
It's time for you to accept reality.

1033
01:25:03,056 --> 01:25:05,016
The world we knew no longer exists.

1034
01:25:07,227 --> 01:25:09,145
We should create a new world together.

1035
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:11,147
The world I want

1036
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:14,400
is one without people like you in it.

1037
01:25:27,831 --> 01:25:31,000
So, Lee Eun-ho, you insist
on taking this to the very end.

1038
01:26:37,066 --> 01:26:37,901
What is it?

1039
01:26:50,538 --> 01:26:51,748
Where is Han Su-na?

1040
01:26:53,791 --> 01:26:55,376
Where is she?!

1041
01:26:58,796 --> 01:27:00,215
She's in the laboratory.

1042
01:27:03,343 --> 01:27:04,427
Lead the way.

1043
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:12,185
You kids get out of here.
Don't you want to see your parents?

1044
01:27:19,192 --> 01:27:20,652
-Hurry up.
-Hey.

1045
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:28,326
Take another step,
and I'll blow her brains out.

1046
01:27:29,118 --> 01:27:32,497
Go ahead.
She won't live much longer anyway.

1047
01:27:33,081 --> 01:27:35,375
Hey, Sergeant Kwon.
Have you lost your mind?

1048
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:37,460
Hey, soldier boy!

1049
01:27:38,044 --> 01:27:40,129
Why aren't the elevators working here?

1050
01:27:42,507 --> 01:27:43,800
Go. I'll take care of him.

1051
01:27:53,101 --> 01:27:54,269
What's with this prick?

1052
01:27:56,437 --> 01:27:57,730
Is that makeup on your face?

1053
01:27:58,815 --> 01:27:59,941
So, you're the hunter?

1054
01:28:00,024 --> 01:28:01,651
What else would I be? A lover?

1055
01:28:02,902 --> 01:28:03,778
Funny.

1056
01:28:04,862 --> 01:28:06,155
I've been looking for you.

1057
01:28:06,906 --> 01:28:08,866
Yeah. I'm in a rush. Let's make it quick.

1058
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:53,119
Daddy did it.

1059
01:28:58,374 --> 01:29:00,084
You waited for too long, right?

1060
01:29:15,391 --> 01:29:16,225
Right.

1061
01:29:17,727 --> 01:29:19,270
You monster.

1062
01:29:25,026 --> 01:29:26,194
Do you really think

1063
01:29:27,862 --> 01:29:30,656
this is the way to save your daughter?

1064
01:29:32,867 --> 01:29:34,535
You truly are amazing, Su-na.

1065
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:37,246
Subjects usually take much longer
to wake up.

1066
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:41,417
It must be nice to be so young.

1067
01:29:42,627 --> 01:29:44,337
My grandma told meâ€¦

1068
01:29:46,255 --> 01:29:47,340
that peopleâ€¦

1069
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:53,971
all reap what they sow.

1070
01:29:55,723 --> 01:29:57,225
You're going to pay

1071
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:00,436
for everything you've done.

1072
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:06,609
Do you thinkâ€¦

1073
01:30:08,611 --> 01:30:10,071
your daughter would accept

1074
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:12,698
what you've become?

1075
01:30:17,954 --> 01:30:19,831
Want me to slice off your tongue?

1076
01:30:45,731 --> 01:30:48,067
Tweaking the composition
was important, right?

1077
01:30:48,985 --> 01:30:51,571
You know that strange water you gave me?

1078
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:54,782
I didn't drink any of it.

1079
01:30:54,866 --> 01:30:56,242
Why youâ€¦

1080
01:31:03,791 --> 01:31:05,293
Isn't it amazing

1081
01:31:07,044 --> 01:31:09,297
that we can achieve something
to this effect?

1082
01:31:17,013 --> 01:31:18,347
Oh God! Doctor!

1083
01:31:25,229 --> 01:31:26,355
Don't come any closer.

1084
01:31:29,525 --> 01:31:30,401
Drop the gun.

1085
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:33,112
Drop it!

1086
01:31:35,573 --> 01:31:36,824
Fuck.

1087
01:31:47,376 --> 01:31:48,753
You crazy bastard.

1088
01:31:54,675 --> 01:31:57,220
-Get So-yeon first.
-Sorry?

1089
01:31:58,387 --> 01:32:00,973
-I said get So-yeon ready first!
-Yes, sir.

1090
01:33:24,890 --> 01:33:26,642
Why won't you bastards just die?

1091
01:33:26,726 --> 01:33:27,810
You can't kill me.

1092
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:43,909
Damn, that's one ugly mug.

1093
01:33:50,207 --> 01:33:51,417
Kim Hak-yong!

1094
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:53,544
Hak-yong!

1095
01:33:53,628 --> 01:33:55,838
-Oh my, Hak-yong.
-Are you all right?

1096
01:33:55,921 --> 01:33:58,966
What's wrong? What happened to you?

1097
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:01,344
Ji-wan!

1098
01:34:02,762 --> 01:34:03,721
All right, let's go.

1099
01:34:03,804 --> 01:34:05,640
Come on. Hurry.

1100
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:09,060
Oh no!

1101
01:34:15,691 --> 01:34:18,444
Doctor.

1102
01:34:18,527 --> 01:34:21,197
Please save me.

1103
01:34:21,781 --> 01:34:24,659
You said that you would save me. The shot.

1104
01:34:24,742 --> 01:34:26,911
Where's the shot? The shot.

1105
01:34:27,536 --> 01:34:29,205
You're going to die anyway.

1106
01:34:30,873 --> 01:34:33,584
No, don't do it. Please don't.

1107
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:41,550
Hey, you son of a bitch!

1108
01:34:48,849 --> 01:34:50,726
What just happened up there?

1109
01:35:08,077 --> 01:35:09,412
It's okay. You'll be fine.

1110
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:13,124
We can start all over again.
You trust your dad, right?

1111
01:35:16,669 --> 01:35:17,628
What's going on?

1112
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:18,629
Hey, Ji-wan!

1113
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:28,389
Ji-wan!

1114
01:35:29,098 --> 01:35:32,017
Hey! Wake up. Come on.

1115
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:34,228
Su-na.

1116
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:37,231
Su-na, are you all right?

1117
01:35:38,774 --> 01:35:39,734
Mister.

1118
01:35:40,484 --> 01:35:42,069
Let's get out of here quickly.

1119
01:35:49,285 --> 01:35:50,369
Those bastards.

1120
01:35:50,453 --> 01:35:52,830
I told them to stay inside,
but they all crawled out.

1121
01:35:53,622 --> 01:35:54,582
Dr. Yang!

1122
01:35:54,665 --> 01:35:55,958
It's Dr. Yang!

1123
01:35:56,041 --> 01:35:58,085
Doctor, what just happened in there?

1124
01:35:58,169 --> 01:36:00,963
Our child is still inside!

1125
01:36:01,046 --> 01:36:03,674
Don't ask me! Get out of my way!

1126
01:36:05,092 --> 01:36:08,763
We did everything you told us to!
What have you done to our kids?!

1127
01:36:08,846 --> 01:36:10,306
Let go of me!

1128
01:36:10,973 --> 01:36:14,560
You've all been living in luxury
by mooching off your kids.

1129
01:36:14,643 --> 01:36:17,438
-His faceâ€¦
-Now you wanna act like good parents?

1130
01:36:27,865 --> 01:36:29,200
So-yeon.

1131
01:36:32,745 --> 01:36:34,038
Is everyone all right?

1132
01:36:34,121 --> 01:36:35,664
-Yeah.
-What about Yang Gi-su?

1133
01:36:35,748 --> 01:36:38,542
We might lose him if we move together.
You take the kids.

1134
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:40,085
Understood.

1135
01:36:41,545 --> 01:36:42,379
Let's go.

1136
01:36:43,506 --> 01:36:45,132
Be careful, mister.

1137
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:47,051
Hurry up and go.

1138
01:36:53,057 --> 01:36:54,058
What's this?

1139
01:36:55,684 --> 01:36:56,519
So-yeon.

1140
01:36:59,730 --> 01:37:01,398
Stop!

1141
01:37:05,027 --> 01:37:06,111
He's a monster.

1142
01:37:14,787 --> 01:37:18,040
You lowlife scum.

1143
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:24,797
Die!

1144
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:32,429
Die! All of you!

1145
01:37:32,513 --> 01:37:33,973
Die!

1146
01:37:38,310 --> 01:37:42,022
You all deserve to die!
I should kill every single one of you.

1147
01:37:42,106 --> 01:37:43,899
Useless scum. Evolutionary rejects.

1148
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:46,527
Ready or not, here I come!

1149
01:37:57,246 --> 01:37:59,206
So-yeon.

1150
01:38:04,962 --> 01:38:05,963
So-yeon.

1151
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:08,048
It's okay, So-yeon.

1152
01:38:08,132 --> 01:38:11,343
It's okay. Daddy will bring you back.

1153
01:38:13,262 --> 01:38:16,974
It's okay.
You're going to be okay. I'm sorry.

1154
01:38:21,812 --> 01:38:23,564
I'm so sorry.

1155
01:39:03,938 --> 01:39:05,105
Yang Gi-su!

1156
01:39:15,282 --> 01:39:16,492
Don't come any closer!

1157
01:39:17,701 --> 01:39:18,744
Not another step.

1158
01:39:19,495 --> 01:39:21,080
I'm going to save my baby girl.

1159
01:39:22,539 --> 01:39:23,874
Don't come any closer!

1160
01:39:28,796 --> 01:39:30,798
That's enough, you monster!

1161
01:39:33,634 --> 01:39:35,302
You were wrong.

1162
01:39:35,386 --> 01:39:37,346
You couldn't save anyone.

1163
01:39:38,222 --> 01:39:39,390
Not even your daughter.

1164
01:39:59,451 --> 01:40:01,203
You people ruined everything.

1165
01:40:03,539 --> 01:40:05,916
You people ruined it all.

1166
01:40:15,009 --> 01:40:16,552
I wasn't wrong.

1167
01:40:18,387 --> 01:40:19,847
You people ruined everything.

1168
01:40:21,098 --> 01:40:21,932
You peopleâ€¦

1169
01:40:23,767 --> 01:40:24,727
You people ruined--

1170
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:12,691
What will you do now?

1171
01:41:12,775 --> 01:41:14,610
I'll start again right here.

1172
01:41:22,785 --> 01:41:23,702
It's raining!

1173
01:41:24,578 --> 01:41:25,412
It's raining!

1174
01:41:25,496 --> 01:41:26,330
It's raining!

1175
01:41:27,873 --> 01:41:28,999
It's really raining.

1176
01:41:30,084 --> 01:41:31,585
How long has it been?

1177
01:41:32,419 --> 01:41:34,254
It's been so long since we had rain.

1178
01:41:40,302 --> 01:41:42,179
Let's go home now.

1179
01:41:43,388 --> 01:41:45,015
Right, let's go.

1180
01:41:45,599 --> 01:41:47,768
God, that's refreshing!

1181
01:42:17,756 --> 01:42:19,550
Line up properly, everyone!

1182
01:42:21,135 --> 01:42:23,804
-Step forward. Let's go.
-Su-na.

1183
01:42:28,350 --> 01:42:31,937
Su-na, white pigs like these
are really delicious, you know.

1184
01:42:35,399 --> 01:42:36,400
That'sâ€¦

1185
01:42:42,906 --> 01:42:44,491
Good luck with her, mister.

1186
01:42:44,575 --> 01:42:45,993
What do you mean, "good luck"?

1187
01:42:46,076 --> 01:42:48,495
-This way, Stepmom!
-What do you mean, "Stepmom"?

1188
01:42:50,706 --> 01:42:52,499
Well, I don't drink.

1189
01:42:55,002 --> 01:42:56,503
What's that ribbon she's wearing?

1190
01:42:57,880 --> 01:42:59,339
-Move.
-Where are you going?

1191
01:42:59,423 --> 01:43:01,300
I didn't survive to put up with this.

1192
01:46:24,669 --> 01:46:28,256
ALL PEOPLE, EVENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, AND SETTINGS

1193
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:30,926
IN THE FILM ARE FICTIONAL
