1
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,247
It had to be a cow.

2
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,085
Couldn't be like a dog or something
that isn't 10,000 pounds.

3
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,936
- Come on! Can you just help me, dude?
- I'm doing all the work here, man.

4
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,406
- Push! Push! Come on!
- Jason, it stepped on my foot.

5
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,720
Pull yourself together.

6
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,776
Just tie it to the bench

7
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,816
- and let's get out of here, please.
- Cow seems unhappy, huh?

8
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,320
Well, it shouldn't be unhappy,
because I just milked her.

9
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,488
Him.

10
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,562
- You just milked him.
- This is a him?

11
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,369
- Was it one udder?
- Yeah.

12
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,696
Yeah, that's not an udder, dude.

13
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,016
I was gonna say,
it was actually kinda weird.

14
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,656
It was really big,
and I had to use two hands.

15
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,656
- It didn't...
- Stop. We will never discuss this again.

16
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,681
That'd be great.

17
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,856
Cops!

18
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,325
The cops are coming.

19
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,730
Beefcake, hide!

20
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,051
What? I'm sorry, Beefcake!

21
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,884
Whoo!

22
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,881
Yeah!

23
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,000
Damn!

24
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,200
Whoa!

25
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,407
Okay.

26
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,167
Come on.

27
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,005
Whoo! Yeah!

28
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,447
Whoa!

29
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,090
Whoa!

30
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,560
You know, I don't think we're ever gonna
understand each other.

31
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,126
Just when I think you've done
the dumbest thing you could possibly do,

32
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,009
you find something
even dumber and you do it.

33
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,003
Thank you.

34
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,526
I promise you, this is not the moment
to be a wiseass.

35
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,936
And I know you think it's noble
that you didn't rat out your friends.

36
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,800
I acted alone.
Beefcake and I had a connection.

37
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,649
Yeah, that's funny.
You know what's not funny?

38
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,449
This was supposed to be your season.

39
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,522
I had scouts coming to every game.

40
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,001
You could have written your own ticket.
Now it's all gone.

41
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,048
Now you gotta come here every Saturday

42
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,771
for the rest of the year
just so you can graduate!

43
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,486
With all these other weirdos
and criminals.

44
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,810
Yeah.

45
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,009
Like you said,
we'll never understand each other.

46
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,208
<i>One play left
in the entire game.</i>

47
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,647
<i>Can Angel Grove do it?
They're down by five.</i>

48
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,296
<i>Jason Scott takes his position
at quarterback. Here comes the snap.</i>

49
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,136
<i>Wide receiver Marty Borne
looks like he's open.</i>

50
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,764
<i>He's getting ready for a pass.</i>

51
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,127
<i>Jason Scott makes...
no, no, wait, he doesn't make a pass!</i>

52
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,368
<i>What a pump fake!
He's running with the ball.</i>

53
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,728
<i>He's at the 20, the 15, the ten.
Jason Scott scores!</i>

54
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,643
<i>Touchdown!</i>

55
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,611
<i>Jason Scott singlehandedly
brings the team home for the championship!</i>

56
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,520
Moo!

57
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,616
That's so funny.

58
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,007
Hey, you sure
you're in the right room?

59
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,400
Oh, big tough guy.

60
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,726
This one goes here.
That one goes there.

61
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,689
Primary colors go on this side,

62
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,360
this one goes...

63
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,485
I'm sorry.

64
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,641
Here, let me help you.

65
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,889
You're a freak. You know that?

66
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,776
I've had to watch you play
with these for weeks.

67
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,847
Are you crazy?

68
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,365
No? What if you had an extra one?

69
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,080
Freak.

70
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,096
Why don't you cut this little act
and do something?

71
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,485
Why don't you stop me? Huh?

72
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,324
- Are you gonna stop...
- Hey!

73
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,568
How old are you? Five?

74
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,161
Hi, I'm Jason. It's my first time here.
It's exciting.

75
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,931
And you must be the bully of detention.

76
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,570
How dumb can you be?

77
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,006
Oh!

78
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,680
Did you just slap me?

79
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,491
I did. Weird, right?

80
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,130
Now I'm gonna be here every day

81
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,204
for what seems like the rest of my life,
and I'm sure that you are, too.

82
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,884
So let's make a deal.

83
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,724
Don't sit near me,

84
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,801
or him,

85
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,086
and we'll be okay.

86
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,362
Okay!

87
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,005
Uh, approved homework,

88
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,447
or working on
the <i>Better Choices</i> workbook.

89
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,456
- These should be out and in progress.
- I need to go to the ladies' room.

90
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,643
Uh... Okay. And good morning.

91
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,086
Oh, my God.

92
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,640
I got your text and I was like,
"Where are they?"

93
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,963
So, this is where you come every Saturday
instead of practice.

94
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,407
- God, this must suck.
- It does.

95
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,536
Well, then you shouldn't have
sent Ty that picture of me.

96
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,245
That's not exactly how it happened.
I mean, he's a liar.

97
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,846
- You punched his tooth out.
- They put it back.

98
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,127
Water under the bridge now.
Let's move on.

99
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,328
Oh, thank God.

100
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,131
We're moving on. Without you.

101
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,487
Cutting you out. Literally.

102
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,609
You can show up for cheer practice
if you want,

103
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,444
but I wouldn't.

104
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,800
Damn, girl!

105
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,642
Oh, my God, what have you done?

106
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,816
Kimberly,
what have you done to your hair?

107
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,016
You cut off your hair?

108
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,880
- Hey... door!
- Kimberly what...

109
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,044
Hey, thanks for that in there.

110
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,566
Ah, no worries. I hate guys like that.

111
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,326
Yeah. Oh... so, hey, we should,
uh, hang out sometime, huh?

112
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,284
Not that we have to.
But I think tonight we should.

113
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,129
- What's your name again?
- Billy.

114
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,770
Billy Cranston.

115
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,126
Or William Cranston.

116
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,210
You remember kids used to call me
Billy Crams-tons as a third-grade joke?

117
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,203
Like Billy crams tons of crayons
in his butt.

118
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,170
Which I didn't!
But it's really impossible to

119
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,376
cram a ton of crayons in a butt.

120
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,496
- No, no, I'm sorry, I shouldn't say that.
- Okay, Billy,

121
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,603
I would honestly hang outwith you,
but I have a date every night

122
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,296
with the Angel Grove Sheriff's Department.

123
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,606
So... I'm sorry.

124
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,967
Wait... no, no, no.
Don't leave, don't leave, hey.

125
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,089
All right, so I don't really expect
for us to hang out.

126
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,736
Truth is I need to get somewhere tonight,
and I could really use your help.

127
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,286
Billy, I hear you, but as I told you,
I have house arrest.

128
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,362
There's nothing I can do about it.
I'm sorry.

129
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,807
Well, like, I mean,
I can fix that.

130
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,201
I know how to trick the SIM.
I have, uh... I have tools.

131
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,362
I have to be in my house before 7:00.

132
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,896
Well, if you come
to my house before 7:00,

133
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,081
then I can fix it for you.

134
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,766
Oh! I also have a car. Or access to a car.

135
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,764
And if you decide to help me,
you can have the car for a few hours.

136
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,048
Come on, honey. Let's go.

137
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,011
Don't be so hard on him.

138
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,287
How do you think he feels
walking around town now?

139
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,880
How do you think I feel
walking around town now?

140
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,256
Let's not do this tonight.

141
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,441
What's the plan, huh?

142
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,568
What's he gonna do with his life?

143
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,051
He could've been so much more.

144
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,920
Get out of the way!

145
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,320
Oh, my God, is that Jason Scott?

146
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,008
Oh, my God! Jason Scott!

147
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,686
- Billy?
- Yeah.

148
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,921
- Billy!
- Yes?

149
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,491
- It's 6:56...
- 6:56, I know.

150
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,016
You got four minutes. Grab that chair.

151
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,044
- What's all this stuff?
- It's objects that I found with my dad.

152
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,736
Most of it is his.

153
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,411
- Hey.
- Where's the cage? Where's the cage?

154
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,005
Here. Here it is.

155
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,645
- Put your foot in this.
- What is it?

156
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,216
It's a Faraday cage. it should stop
the cell signal if we're lucky.

157
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,456
That's the three-minute warning.

158
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,086
- Come on, bud. If the signal goes off...
- My dad's been dead

159
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,801
now seven years,
four months, and two days?

160
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,644
- Yeah, two days.
- Um, okay, um...

161
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,047
That's a long time.
He used to work at the mine.

162
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,487
Billy, I really don't think
that we have time...

163
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,250
You still live at 4455 Old Wharf?

164
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,576
- Yes... yes, I do.
- Great house.

165
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,887
- Okay.
- So, yeah, about my dad.

166
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,560
We used to go and find objects together.

167
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,840
Some really, really old.

168
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,136
I'm gonna get in trouble, Billy.

169
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,776
Oh! Almost like that show
<i>American Pickers.</i>

170
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,016
Billy, the signal's gonna go off.

171
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,096
We should've definitely
had our own TV show.

172
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,616
That would've been so crazy.

173
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,336
What are you doing?

174
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,044
Dude, come on, seriously!

175
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,446
It's gonna go... Billy, come on!

176
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,522
What?

177
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,531
Thank you.

178
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,007
Mmm-hmm.
Can you stop touching me now?

179
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,056
It's so cool
you actually showed up.

180
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,730
Well, you are giving me the van.

181
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,610
Lending you the van. But, yeah.

182
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,761
How much further is it?

183
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,242
Just 44 minutes and 52 seconds.

184
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,805
Uh... Okay.

185
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,211
Thank you for helping me today.

186
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,322
That's okay, Billy.

187
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,730
Uh... Okay, this is the entrance

188
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,451
to the gold mine, and clearly,
Billy, the sign says...

189
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,602
Keep driving.

190
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,121
Okay.

191
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,376
If we find something cool,
then you can keep half.

192
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,856
- It's a rule that me and my dad made.
- Thanks, Billy.

193
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,850
They're gonna blow
this whole thing.

194
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,206
It'll all be gone in a week.

195
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,204
Billy, can I be honest? The deal was
I drop you somewhere,

196
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,964
and I get the van
for a few hours, okay?

197
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,451
This is weird.

198
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,056
Like, we don't know each other at all.

199
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,844
I don't know what we're doing here.

200
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,096
- And you seem kinda...
- Wait, I gotta tell you something, okay?

201
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,121
I'm on the spectrum.

202
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,564
Well, is that like a workout program?

203
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,766
Like Tae Bo?

204
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,083
No. It's a diagnosis. Excuse me.

205
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,329
I know. It was a joke. I was kidding.

206
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,209
See, that's the thing.
I didn't get the joke.

207
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,284
Like my brain doesn't work the same
as yours does, you know?

208
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,170
Yeah, well,
consider that a good thing.

209
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,084
It's just that I can't read
humor or... or sarcasm.

210
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,456
- Oh! But I do remember things.
- Okay.

211
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,720
- I remember everything.
- Okay.

212
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,801
Billy, let me stop you.

213
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,086
Okay.

214
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,801
You don't need to tell me all this.
We're cool.

215
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,047
Okay. Well, we're almost there.

216
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,456
Which is good news, so...

217
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,324
Take my spare flashlight now,
'cause it's gonna be dark

218
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,845
- when we get back.
- Bye, Billy!

219
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,046
Okay!

220
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,007
Ah, she's back again.

221
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,607
Oh, crazy girl.

222
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,081
Just like clockwork.

223
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,963
Who are you?

224
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,086
No way!

225
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,967
Uh... hello?

226
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,526
Hey!

227
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,051
Hey!

228
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,404
No, no, no, no. Kimberly!

229
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,640
Kimberly!

230
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,848
Okay. Okay.

231
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,960
- It's strange to hear you say my name.
- What?

232
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,571
What did you say?

233
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,041
I said, it's strange
to hear you say my name.

234
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,121
Like we know each other.

235
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,204
We... we do know each other.

236
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,523
Oh, we know who each other are,
but we don't really know each other.

237
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,210
I know you used to date Ty Fleming.

238
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,851
Oh. Then you know
I punched his tooth out.

239
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,205
I know they put it back.

240
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,484
Dad, I hope you're watching.
Gonna make you proud.

241
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,680
Dad, I forgot to tell you, uh,

242
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,411
I took the van without
asking Mom's permission.

243
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,801
Well, I'm telling you,
so I think that's okay.

244
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,809
Anyways, I gotta focus. Okay.

245
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,163
So what are you doing up here?
Did you follow me?

246
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,005
I, uh, came with... Billy.

247
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,801
Billy Cranston? Weird.
But I've seen him up here before.

248
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,962
My house is on the other side
of the mountain.

249
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,247
I hike these trails sometimes,
clear my head,

250
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,563
and I stare down
at Angel Grove and wonder

251
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,484
how such a small, crap town
could cause me such misery.

252
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,643
That funny to you?

253
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,603
No, I just... I feel the same way.

254
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,446
Yeah. Jason Scott, star quarterback,
crashes and burns.

255
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,602
Destroys his career
and destroys our season.

256
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,966
Go Tigers.

257
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,447
Yeah, now I walk around town
and everyone's looking at me

258
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,409
like I ran over their dog.

259
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,004
So why don't you leave?
You know, just go.

260
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,970
- I could leave here, you know?
- Where?

261
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,280
God, anywhere.

262
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,930
So let's go.

263
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,650
What?

264
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,529
- You'd never do it.
- Try me.

265
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,244
Oh, what, you and me? You got a car?

266
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,687
- I have a van.
- Ooh, that's creepy.

267
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,016
It's not that kind of van.

268
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,530
Every van is that kind of van.

269
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,931
So, let's go.

270
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,042
Are you daring me? 'Cause I'll go.

271
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,641
Okay.

272
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,241
Dad, get ready.

273
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,920
That didn't work.

274
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,325
Whoa! Whoa!

275
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,936
- That really rung my bell.
- Hey, hey, hey!

276
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,136
Go, go, go, go, go!

277
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,924
- Oh! Wow!
- Hey!

278
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,081
What are you doing, dude?

279
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,616
I been digging up here for some years.

280
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,086
Hey! Easy, guy. Let's sort this out, huh?

281
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,003
- I seen him up here before.
- Hey, Jason.

282
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,367
Dude cannot be walking around
blowing stuff up!

283
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,408
I was just trying to dig
a little deeper!

284
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,520
Maybe I dug too deep, huh?

285
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,006
Billy, you don't have to yell.
We can hear you, okay?

286
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,242
- Okay!
- Hey!

287
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,288
You guys looking
to get busted or something?

288
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,124
This place is a restricted area!

289
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,328
Oh, really, Einstein? Restricted?

290
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,051
As in, we shouldn't be standing
on crazy rocks

291
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,610
doing <i>Karate Kid</i> moves, right?

292
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,045
Uh... Guys...

293
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,121
Yeah. I see you.

294
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,329
Yeah, or camping out on old trains.
I see you, too, homeboy.

295
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,696
Uh, guys...

296
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,416
There's a lotta mine security
out tonight.

297
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,776
- Who is she?
- I don't know.

298
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,040
I've never seen her before.

299
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,804
Oh, no.

300
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,240
Whoa!

301
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,971
Are you okay?

302
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,849
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

303
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,321
Whoa.

304
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,363
What is it?

305
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,646
Whoa.

306
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,923
I've never seen glass like this before.

307
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,411
Oh, my God.

308
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,888
What is it? What is that?

309
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,883
There's something in there.

310
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,281
Move.

311
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,840
- All right, watch out, watch out. Look!
- What are you doing?

312
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,843
- Wait, no, no, no! No, no!
- Seriously?

313
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,560
- What are you doing?
- Oh, yeah!

314
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,816
My dad always knew the right spots.

315
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,649
There's gotta be more. Let's get it!

316
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,240
- Get out of the way.
- That doesn't mean keep banging!

317
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,281
Oh!

318
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,486
What is it?

319
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,971
What is that?

320
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,456
- What? No, no! Don't break it.
- No. No, no, no!

321
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,767
Don't break it! Don't break it!
Don't break...

322
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,444
You broke it. Okay.

323
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,761
Wow. What?

324
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,611
- Oh, my God.
- What is that?

325
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,842
Yo, look, we all found these.

326
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,008
- If they're worth any money...
- No, he found them.

327
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,296
Now chill out.

328
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,368
- Chill out?
- Guys, guys, do you hear that?

329
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,329
Mine security. Peace.

330
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,846
Somebody should have pointed
that out. Wait, I did.

331
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,809
Billy!

332
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,644
- Wait, okay, okay.
- Run!

333
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,085
Billy! Just run to the... come on!

334
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,605
Billy, let's go!

335
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,200
- Haul ass, dude!
- I'm coming!

336
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,120
Are you kidding me?

337
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,126
Ja... Jason! Jason!

338
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,296
- What are you doing?
- You gotta open the doors!

339
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,401
Open the door!

340
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,608
- Yes, okay, just get in.
- What are you doing?

341
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,136
Did you see them?
Are they down the road?

342
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,161
- I don't know.
- Okay.

343
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,656
Okay, what about the others?

344
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,126
- You gonna leave the others?
- Hold on.

345
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,602
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Jason!

346
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,689
Whoo!

347
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,496
- Oh, my mom's gonna kill me.
<i>- Stop right there!</i>

348
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,729
- Shit! Put your seat belt on.
- I got my seat belt on!

349
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,564
- Jason! Somebody's gonna die.
- Whoa!

350
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,404
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoo-hoo!

351
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,805
Whoa!

352
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,536
- There they are!
- Okay, so...

353
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,336
- Up the hill. Come on!
- Get 'em!

354
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,616
Okay!

355
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,536
- Okay, you drive.
- No, I... I really don't drive.

356
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,042
Okay, then really don't drive,
so I can pull them in.

357
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,736
I don't drive!

358
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,171
Get your foot!

359
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,936
- I got it.
- Wait, it says that the door's open.

360
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,724
That's because it's open, Billy.

361
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,485
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

362
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,849
- Go, go, go!
- Okay. Okay.

363
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,082
There they are!
Get closer to them.

364
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,161
Get in!

365
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,247
Gotcha.

366
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,446
- I gotcha!
- I'm in!

367
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,691
What about the other guy?

368
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,609
- Just go!
- Go! Go!

369
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,640
Billy, look out!

370
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,616
Let's go downhill! Go to the lights below!

371
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,056
- You wanna drive now?
- Keep going, Billy,

372
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,287
- we're almost there.
- Guys! Guys, there's a train.

373
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,964
We got it.

374
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,761
Okay.

375
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,216
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

376
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,685
Hey!

377
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,856
Hey, what do you want me to do?

378
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,216
- Hey!
- Keep going! I'll pull him in!

379
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,004
Okay.

380
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,041
Are you crazy?

381
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,610
Yeah, I am.

382
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,765
Yo, it's catching up.

383
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,680
Look, there's the railroad crossing.
That's the way out, Billy.

384
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,720
- You got it.
- You got it!

385
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,006
I hope he has it.

386
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,447
- He definitely doesn't have it.
- I got it! I got it!

387
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,444
Storm's turned. It's gotten bad.
We're getting out of here.

388
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,091
Let's go!

389
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,730
Let's go!

390
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,001
Pull it port!

391
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,169
Pull up the net!

392
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,322
Let's go, boys! Pull!

393
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,129
A little more starboard!

394
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,328
Let her go!

395
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,001
What the hell is that?

396
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,969
Get back!

397
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,161
- Wide to the port! ...now!
- Yeah!

398
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,366
Okay.

399
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,200
Billy!
What's happening down there?

400
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,201
What?

401
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,328
- Where's your bodyguard?
- What are you doing?

402
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,768
I'm just gonna quietly snap your wrist,
you little bitch.

403
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,362
Oh, no, no, no. Oh... Okay.

404
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,920
Billy Cranston

405
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,805
just knocked Colt Wallace
out cold! Damn, Billy!

406
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,763
What happened?
What happened?

407
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,882
- I didn't see it!
- Hi, Billy.

408
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,442
Hey. Come on, come on.

409
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,766
- Am I crazy or this is crazy, right?
- It's crazy.

410
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,922
We got hit by a train
and we're standing here.

411
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,047
How is that possible?

412
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,885
I don't remember getting home
from the mine at all.

413
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,769
I slept all day yesterday.

414
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,370
We gotta find Billy.

415
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,205
You know I wasn't trying to start
any trouble or anything like that.

416
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,721
And I say, "Hey, man, look,
I'm not a violent person.

417
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,451
But if you must come at me,
come at me, bro."

418
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,521
- Sweet!
- Yeah!

419
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,284
Boom! Down goes douchebag.

420
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,091
- Down goes... I... I can't say that word.
- Billy.

421
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,327
Hey, Kimberly... Kimberly Hart.

422
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,811
We need to talk.

423
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,689
How... what?

424
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,520
- Since when does he know Kimberly Hart?
- Billy's awesome.

425
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,211
Nice hair.

426
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,084
- Billy, look at me.
- Huh?

427
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,650
Do you feel weird?

428
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,722
You mean like weirder than usual?

429
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,882
Yeah. Different.

430
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,007
Oh.

431
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,362
Listen, we know something
happened up there, okay?

432
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,487
I'm not the same.

433
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,800
Me either. Oh! I'm strong.

434
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,281
- How strong?
- Like, insanely strong.

435
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,364
I feel like we need
to go back up there.

436
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,006
The counter's boiling.

437
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,171
We're going back today.

438
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,241
Yeah.

439
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,282
Come on up.

440
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,442
Oh, she's down here.

441
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,760
So you're sure it's a woman?

442
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,890
Not a great-looking woman.
Come see for yourself.

443
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,486
Oh, that smell is... it's intense.

444
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,050
You should make a note of that.

445
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,203
Smell inside an old fishing boat
that holds tons of dead fish

446
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,725
doesn't smell so good.

447
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,841
Freaky, right?

448
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,251
- Look, do you need us?
- No.

449
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,880
All right, 'cause I need to get to bed.

450
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,685
Lock up when you're done.
There's beers in the fridge.

451
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,920
Jesus.

452
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,321
Jesus.

453
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,720
Unit two, this is Meinen.

454
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,768
I have a body. A deceased female.

455
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,124
Let's just keep going.

456
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,251
Guys, look.
Look, it's that guy again.

457
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,845
Find anything interesting?

458
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,649
If I do, I'm keeping it!

459
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,768
- We know why you're here.
- Oh, yeah?

460
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,726
You guys wake up surprised to be alive
and jump over a house?

461
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,406
Yeah. Kinda. Well... no.

462
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,696
Look, we're different, all right?
Everything's different.

463
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,529
Uh, you're Zack, right?

464
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,090
Yup.

465
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,162
You still go to Angel Grove?

466
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,004
Ha! Sometimes!

467
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,289
You know, the other girl was here too,
about an hour ago.

468
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,806
Hey, you mean that girl right there?

469
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,405
Hey! Come on down!

470
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,211
We should figure this out together!

471
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,564
- Whoa.
- Oh, screw this.

472
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,416
- Okay, let me handle this.
- She got up there pretty fast.

473
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,488
No, no, no!

474
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,010
Yo, keep up.

475
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,801
Stop!

476
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,085
Just... just talk to me.

477
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,604
You have a coin. We have a coin.

478
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,320
We should just talk about this.
I mean, we don't know what this...

479
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,322
- Whoa! Whoa!
- What is wrong with you?

480
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,521
Whoa.

481
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,207
Oh, you're crazy! But so am I.

482
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,924
- Whoa, Zack.
- No, I got this.

483
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,176
- Wait, wait.
- No, I got this.

484
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,884
- What are you doing?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

485
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,644
Hey!

486
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,121
- I got her!
- Get off of me.

487
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,361
Just jump over.

488
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,442
Let's go. Jump with me. Yeah.

489
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,736
No, no, no! Don't-don't jump.
- Okay.

490
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,576
- Don't jump. Don't jump.
- I'm gonna jump across with her,

491
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,931
and then you jump, okay?

492
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,096
- Piece o' cake.
- No, no, no!

493
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,327
Don't, don't! Jason! Hey!

494
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,243
That's not a piece o' cake!

495
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,640
- You all right?
- Yeah, no problem.

496
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,331
You got this, Billy!

497
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,686
No, I don't!

498
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,127
- It's fun.
- It's such a far jump.

499
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,256
- Come on, let's go, dude.
- Billy, come on.

500
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,376
- We all did it.
- Yeah,

501
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,129
you'll be fine, I promise. Just jump.

502
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,336
Come on, do it, dude. Let's go.

503
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,976
The drop is probably
more than 100 feet,

504
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,525
which means death is imminent.

505
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,682
Okay, so if you die, Billy,
what's gonna happen?

506
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,046
Okay, your mom'll be alone.

507
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,976
But it's okay 'cause
she could find somebody else.

508
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,296
But she couldn't,
'cause you love your mom

509
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,576
- and you won't really...
- He's scared.

510
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,696
He'll come across, he's fine.

511
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,210
Okay. Okay.

512
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,362
Visualize jumping across!

513
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,096
- And then do it!
- Come on, you got this!

514
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,360
Okay!

515
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,521
Billy, you got this!

516
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,726
Whoa! Oh, shit!

517
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,040
Whoa!

518
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,856
- Are you okay?
- I got it.

519
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,936
- Come on, climb up. Climb up.
- I did it.

520
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,096
- Billy, you got it.
- I did it!

521
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,929
See, what'd we tell you, Billy?
You got it!

522
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,405
Told you. See?

523
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,891
- Whoo!
- Yes!

524
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,570
Billy, right! Yeah!

525
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,005
- Whoa!
- Billy!

526
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,081
- Oh, my God!
- Billy!

527
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,686
Billy!

528
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,404
Billy!

529
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,562
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Billy!

530
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,767
- We just kill that dude?
- What do we do?

531
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,889
No, no, no, no, no, no.

532
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,691
Hey, guys,
you gotta come down here!

533
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,520
It's water! You gotta see this!

534
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,050
Yo, all right!
I'll see you guys down there.

535
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,610
Uh... bring that crazy girl.

536
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,565
Come on, you guys, let's go! Whoo!

537
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,687
Whoa!

538
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,605
Uh, hey... could I get a sip
of your water?

539
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,681
I'm dying.

540
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,767
Okay. Just don't finish it.

541
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,241
Thanks. And I'm really sorry.

542
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,084
Sorry for what?

543
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,286
Whoa!

544
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,802
Yeah!

545
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,529
Welcome to the club!

546
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,562
'Sup, crazy girl?

547
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,450
We gotta do that again.

548
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,361
Oh, thank goodness.

549
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,003
- Hey, guys. Guys!
- What?

550
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,844
- Check out how we glow.
- Cool.

551
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,287
- Oh, yeah!
- I like this.

552
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,203
I'm blue!

553
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,000
That's not my favorite color,
but it's cool.

554
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,847
I'm black!

555
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,524
- What?
- I am.

556
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,568
No, you're not.

557
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,125
Hey, guys. There's something down there.
Follow me.

558
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,123
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

559
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,850
Jason, I'm sliding!

560
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,209
- Hi.
- Again?

561
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,768
Well, that is unusual.

562
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,687
This just gets better and better.

563
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,360
Do you feel that?

564
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,644
There's something out here.

565
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,370
The walls are shaking.

566
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,681
Come on.

567
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,645
That's impossible.

568
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,525
This must have been here
for millions of years.

569
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,206
I mean, look how the rock
has grown around it.

570
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,440
I don't like this place.

571
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,846
Hey, guys.

572
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,765
Check it out.

573
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,083
- Okay.
- Okay.

574
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,408
- Holy sh...
- Shh!

575
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,848
- What? Think there's aliens in here?
- Just be quiet, Zack.

576
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,610
It's so cold in here.

577
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,370
Jason, is this real?

578
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,408
Like, are we really in a spaceship
right now?

579
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,801
I think so. Just... just breathe, okay?

580
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,961
Okay.

581
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,647
Hey. We've all seen enough.
Right? We should go now?

582
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,370
What? We're gonna be famous!

583
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,522
- What is wrong with you?
- Quiet!

584
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,250
There's something here.

585
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,409
Whoa!

586
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,760
- Ah!
- What was that?

587
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,121
Whoa.

588
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,006
What's going on?

589
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,776
- The stairs!
- Oh, my God!

590
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,086
There's no way out.

591
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,050
- Guys, guys, guys!
- Let's go! That way! Let's go! Let's go!

592
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,929
- I'm going!
- Run!

593
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,891
Come on, come on.

594
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,131
Didi, I'm coming!

595
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,731
You're real!

596
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,326
Leave her alone!

597
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,247
We will kill you.

598
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,890
Kill me? How?

599
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,081
There's five of us.

600
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,456
Yes, I know! I've been waiting for you.

601
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,121
Wait, where's the other guy?
One, two, three, four... oh! There he is.

602
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,487
Oh, no, no, no!

603
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,925
All of you.

604
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,004
In a spaceship buried underground?
How long have you been waiting?

605
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,287
- What's today? Monday?
- Yeah.

606
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,930
Then 65 million years.

607
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,163
I've been very lonely.

608
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,370
You're all so young-looking.

609
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,124
This has to do with the coins?

610
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,366
Yes, yes, the coins!

611
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,616
Different colors. Different kids.

612
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,324
Different-colored kids!

613
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,448
I'm so excited you're here!

614
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,406
Turn around.

615
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,406
Go on.

616
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,331
No way.

617
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,450
Proceed.

618
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,204
Think this'll work.

619
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,442
One, two, three, four, five.
Different colors.

620
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,603
Guys, let's focus on getting out of here.

621
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,603
Stay together,
and then when we see a chance...

622
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,843
- We run like hell.
- Okay. And if we don't get a chance?

623
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,081
Then we kill it.

624
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,411
Shouldn't hurt, but let's see.

625
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,209
Please, step into the footprints.

626
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,456
No. We are not going to do that.

627
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,881
Hey, question. Um, what are you?

628
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,203
I'm Alpha 5,
an alphormic lorcaid persona android.

629
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,806
- What? Yeah, I know.
- He said he's a Alpha 5...

630
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,566
I'm a talking robot. You can trust me.

631
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,367
Billy!

632
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,565
What the hell?

633
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,686
Okay.

634
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,976
Why do you keep looking
at each other?

635
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,445
Is that, like, a human thing?

636
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,601
Fascinating.

637
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,764
Oh, it's working!
This is great! It's working!

638
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,376
Zordon, are you there? Zordon!

639
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,401
Okay. Okay.

640
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,528
Come on! Let's go! Move!

641
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,007
Go, go, go!

642
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,568
Come forward, please!

643
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,608
Do we have a choice?

644
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,920
Don't think so.

645
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,367
Look! It's Zordon!

646
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,726
What?

647
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,690
Zordon, they don't know who you are.

648
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,250
Come in! Come in!

649
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,891
These are them?
They're so small.

650
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,689
Funny, I said the same thing, actually.

651
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,206
You mean to tell me
that the fate of the universe

652
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,090
is placed in the hands
of these... these children?

653
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,401
The universe? That's a big place.

654
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,970
They're teenagers.

655
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,281
Somewhere between infancy
and full maturity.

656
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,489
- It's hard to explain, really. I don't...
- Show me the coins.

657
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,042
The morphing grid is never wrong.

658
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,010
If the power coins
have returned to the ship with these...

659
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,081
Teenagers!

660
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,889
With these teenagers,

661
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,442
then these teenagers
are the Power Rangers.

662
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,806
Power Rangers!

663
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,481
What?

664
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,688
Okay, quick question.

665
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,569
Hello. Hate to interrupt.

666
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,211
Did I just hear you say
we're Power Rangers?

667
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,682
Yes. Yes. You are the Power Rangers.

668
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,046
Any other questions?

669
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,929
- No, I think I'm good.
- Good.

670
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,970
I got a question.
Um... Hi, how you doing?

671
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,884
Oh, okay... um, my name is Billy.
Billy Cranston.

672
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,760
- Kids used to call me Billy Crams-tons...
- Billy! Stop.

673
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:50,606
I'm sorry.
Uh... the images here in this sphere

674
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,762
tell a history of the Power Rangers.

675
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:56,686
Looks like the Power Rangers
were a team that protected life.

676
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,401
And life is a bright light.
Or... a piece of light?

677
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,562
Yes. Yes, very good, Billy.

678
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,369
It is called the Zeo Crystal.

679
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,016
Oh, I love this part.
This is good.

680
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,691
And every planet
in the universe that has life

681
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,081
has a piece of the crystal
buried inside it.

682
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,456
Sixty-five million years ago,

683
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,963
Zordon's team died defending the crystal
here in what is now Angel Grove.

684
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,616
- The coins have chosen you five.
- Yes! I knew it!

685
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:24,487
Now you must protect the Zeo Crystal
and life on earth.

686
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,291
Because... we... are the Power Rangers?

687
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,249
He's smart!

688
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,687
I'm sorry, um, is this some kind of joke?

689
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,649
Like, I'm standing here with a wet wedgie.

690
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,041
My socks are soaked.
We're squishing around in here.

691
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,849
We're talking to a wall. I mean, guys...

692
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,888
Silence!

693
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,961
<i>Dig! Dig, Goldar!</i>

694
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,207
Sir, I'm detecting
elevated heart rates.

695
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,123
They're... they're very scared.

696
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,770
I don't understand.

697
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,490
Why would you show us that nightmare?

698
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,642
It's not a nightmare.
It's the future.

699
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,688
- Was that for real?
- Felt like it.

700
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,650
- And who was that woman?
- Her name is Rita Repulsa.

701
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,603
She will create Goldar,

702
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,803
a huge monster who will rip the crystal
from the earth,

703
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,850
and all life on your planet will die.

704
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,289
With the crystal, Rita will have the power
to create and destroy worlds.

705
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,488
So, let me guess.

706
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,291
You want us to kill this woman? R... Rita?

707
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,526
Ay, ay, ay! Rita!

708
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,011
She must be stopped.

709
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,650
When is she coming?

710
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,880
She's already here.

711
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,729
My best guess is we have 11 months.

712
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,009
Oh, I'm sorry, days. Days, 11 days.

713
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,361
If we're the Power Rangers
and this is our ship,

714
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,736
if I walk through that door right now,
will it open for me?

715
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,125
Yes, of course.

716
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,850
Let's go.

717
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,176
Whoa, what you doing?

718
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,090
No, no, no, come back!
No. No, please, don't leave.

719
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,245
Jason, my ranger team died
defending the crystal from Rita.

720
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,163
That's why I'm in this wall.

721
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,129
How'd you know my name?

722
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,409
Because it's you, Jason Scott.

723
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:44,809
You are the leader.
You are the Red Ranger.

724
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,248
Rita was a ranger, too. And my friend.

725
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,242
But she betrayed us.

726
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,448
Wanted more power.

727
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,806
She lost her way.

728
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:02,204
Now she is just pure evil.

729
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,204
You must bring them back.
All of the rangers.

730
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,681
You must train your team to stop Rita

731
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,081
before she has the strength
to find the crystal.

732
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,084
Okay. I'm leaving.

733
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:17,404
- And I only speak for myself when I...
- No! You speak for all of them.

734
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:20,689
You know that, deep down,
what I'm saying is true.

735
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,603
You were born for this.

736
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,201
You all waited.

737
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,281
Even you.

738
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,442
Who... exactly are you?

739
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,284
Really? Now you're gonna ask me
who I am?

740
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,362
- Look, her name is Didi.
- Trini.

741
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,602
She's new at school.
Transferred in a month ago.

742
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,856
We have English together, right?

743
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,803
I've been at Angel Grove
for over a year now.

744
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,406
We have biology together. Good talk.

745
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,130
Wait, look...

746
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,487
none of us really know each other, okay?

747
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,561
But somehow...

748
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,610
we were all in the same place
at the same time

749
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,816
when Billy found those coins.

750
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,241
- And...
- Wait, wait, wait! Can I ask a question?

751
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,446
Are we really superheroes?

752
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,291
Like are we more like
Iron Man or Spider-Man?

753
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,856
'Cause I feel like I been bit by a spider,

754
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,176
but I feel really good,
you know, not as...

755
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,522
All right, look, bro,
trust me, you're not a superhero.

756
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,602
Why are you talking to us
like you're the boss now?

757
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,763
Hey, hold up.
Can any of this Rita stuff be real?

758
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,205
Can any of it be true?

759
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,486
I don't know.

760
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,291
But I know that the answer
to what's wrong with us

761
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,283
and to what's happening to us...

762
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,486
is here.

763
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,602
So what are you saying?

764
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,409
I think we gotta come back.

765
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,085
I can't make you come back here.

766
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:39,210
But 4:00 tomorrow... I'll be here.

767
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,770
Hey, Jason, we don't... we don't...

768
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,896
- That makes sense. That makes sense.
- Of course.

769
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,126
I don't know

770
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,280
why I didn't think about
that one in the first place.

771
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,490
So where were you today?

772
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,801
Were you with friends?
Do you have any friends?

773
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,616
- Why are you so tired...
- Okay, this is the problem.

774
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,696
You ask her four questions before
she's even answered the first.

775
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:43,202
Because she's like a ghost around here.
She needs to start communicating.

776
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,567
- June...
- Say something.

777
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,244
- Speak! I just...
- Relax.

778
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,322
Okay. Relax.

779
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,609
Okay, Trini, let's start over.

780
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,523
Please tell us one thing you did today.

781
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,847
Me and four kids from Angel Grove
found a spaceship buried underground.

782
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,160
What?

783
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,682
I'm pretty sure I'm a superhero.

784
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,246
Cool.

785
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,606
Not cool.

786
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,808
Pee in that cup!

787
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,440
This to remind me of my screw-up?

788
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:24,570
No. Wrecking yard
only offered me 300 bucks for it and...

789
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,686
you know, the frame's straight
and the engine still runs.

790
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,804
Figure I'd leave it up to you to decide
if you wanted to fix it.

791
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,365
Oh, shit.

792
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,683
Mr. Scott,
there's been an incident on your boat.

793
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:50,242
It's a terrible situation.
You gotta come with me.

794
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,608
<i>A series of grisly crime
scenes has the sleepy fishing hamlet</i>

795
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,682
<i>of Angel Grove reeling.</i>

796
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,136
<i>- Bodies were discovered...</i>
- I'm building Goldar for you...

797
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,130
<i>This rash of violence
has the town on edge.</i>

798
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,166
Goldar's coming.
Goldar's coming.

799
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:14,131
Goldar's coming. Goldar's coming.

800
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,690
What the hell you doing?

801
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:21,290
I need gold.
I will build my beautiful Goldar.

802
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:25,604
Goldar takes the Zeo Crystal.
I take the universe.

803
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,447
Me, too!

804
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,925
- What's up, crazy girl?
- Hey.

805
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,365
Shall we do this?

806
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,169
You need
to follow the three rules

807
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,924
to being a Power Ranger.

808
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,651
You must never use your powers
for personal gain.

809
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,964
You must never escalate a fight,
unless your enemy forces you to.

810
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,328
And you must never reveal
your identity. Ever.

811
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,563
To assume your ranger identities,
you need to morph.

812
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,722
Have any of you morphed before?

813
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,883
Yes. But only in the shower.

814
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,804
Okay, okay. Let's step
into the footprints, please.

815
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,166
Let's try this.

816
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,004
Standing in this circle as a team,

817
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,128
you can easily connect
to the morphing grid.

818
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,123
- Do you feel it?
- Yeah, they do.

819
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,123
No. Not feeling it.

820
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,282
You need to morph
to get your armor.

821
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,728
I knew it!
We do get armor.

822
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,087
Jason! We get armor! Oh, we get armor.

823
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,401
Cool. When do you give us the armor?

824
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,841
You already have it
inside of you.

825
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,496
You bring it out
by connecting to each other

826
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,761
and connecting to the morphing grid.

827
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:06,481
Clear your minds and focus.

828
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:11,726
Power Rangers were a legion of warriors
sworn to protect life.

829
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,847
Yes!

830
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:15,571
You must become those warriors.

831
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,290
Become the warriors!

832
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,561
What?

833
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,529
What? What, did it... did it work?

834
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,443
Alpha 5, why didn't they morph?

835
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,967
Yeah, I don't... I don't know, sir.
It's... it's disturbing.

836
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,202
Very disturbing.
This might take some time.

837
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,566
We don't have time.

838
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,405
If they can't morph,
what are we supposed to do?

839
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,856
They'll have to train
without armor.

840
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,487
- They need to prepare.
- Without armor?

841
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,766
Sir, that'll be very painful.

842
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,410
Take them down to the pit.

843
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,651
All right, follow me.
We're going to the pit!

844
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,563
Jason, I don't wanna find out
what the pit is.

845
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:58,530
So this is the pit. It's nice, right?

846
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,443
<i>Alpha 5, begin the exercise.</i>

847
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,010
Uh... sorry, guys.

848
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:04,003
- What exercise?
- Chill out, dude.

849
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,807
<i>These creatures before you</i>

850
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,564
<i>are a simulation of Rita's army.</i>

851
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:13,966
<i>They're called Putties.</i>

852
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,361
<i>You must get through them to get to her.</i>

853
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,680
No, no, no, no, Jason.

854
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,923
Cool. Look, relax, guys. It's a hologram.

855
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,923
Like a video game. Look.

856
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,604
Whoa!

857
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,762
That's a strong-ass hologram.

858
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,930
Not a video game.

859
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,606
<i>This is why you must morph
into your armor.</i>

860
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,604
<i>If Rita becomes strong enough
to build her army,</i>

861
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,842
<i>it'll be the beginning of the end.</i>

862
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,366
<i>Rangers, welcome to training.</i>

863
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,216
I'm so excited you guys are back.

864
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,720
Aim for the center mass.

865
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,961
One more time.

866
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:48,008
Come on, duck the punches.
Find their weak side.

867
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,208
Oh...

868
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,567
Let's go a couple o' hits, okay?
Hit one...

869
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:53,687
No, let's try it again.

870
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,976
Now this is exciting.

871
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,726
Yeah, Trini!

872
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,566
<i>Hai!</i>

873
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,687
Ready, master Billy?

874
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:06,006
You need to learn the element of surprise.

875
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,208
Ready? Let's go again.

876
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,084
All right, Billy, lighter on your feet.

877
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:12,801
Hands up.

878
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,686
Play with some energy now!
Let's go!

879
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,526
Focus! Focus!
Everybody just focus!

880
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,166
Lucky shot.

881
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,568
You guys all know
you could be murdered, right'?

882
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,607
No.

883
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,244
<i>You must shed
your masks to wear this armor.</i>

884
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:06,800
I don't feel anything.

885
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,884
Take them down to the pit.

886
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,200
Now watch me...

887
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,329
slip, grab, lift.

888
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,401
Yeah!

889
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,687
Slip, grab, lift!

890
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,721
Yes!

891
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:42,211
<i>Think only of each other,</i>

892
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,248
<i>and the morphing grid will open to you.</i>

893
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,526
Is it working?

894
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,761
No, it's not.

895
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,251
Come on! Try harder!

896
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,851
<i>Let's just concentrate.</i>

897
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,720
<i>I've been concentrating
though, Jason.</i>

898
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,376
<i>'Cause we haven't been
concentrating...</i>

899
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,536
<i>all we need to do is just concentrate.</i>

900
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,005
Don't tell me to concentrate.

901
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,206
Just follow my lead.

902
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,456
Let's not fight with each other.

903
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,164
<i>Zack, now is not the time.</i>

904
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,282
Come on. Let's go train.

905
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,569
The information we need to triangulate

906
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,928
the location of the crystal
was lost in the battle. So...

907
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,729
Billy, are you listening to me?

908
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:16,840
Billy, what are you doing?

909
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,247
Billy!

910
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:23,166
Where's the crystal?
Find it, Billy, find it.

911
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,969
Where's the crystal?

912
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:26,241
There.

913
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:29,483
One, two... Okay, 17 degrees north...

914
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,562
Hey, idiot,
watch where you're going!

915
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,280
- One, two, three...
- Wake up!

916
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,416
<i>Two fishermen
were laid to rest today</i>

917
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,283
<i>at Saint Andrew's Cemetery.</i>

918
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:47,170
<i>Residents of Angel Grove
are feeling the shock.</i>

919
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,720
<i>Fear has the town on edge.</i>

920
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,326
<i>This series of murders has police baffled</i>

921
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:55,808
<i>as police have linked the loss of gold
to each crime scene.</i>

922
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,804
<i>What is now being dubbed
"Angel Grove's Gold Killer"</i>

923
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,120
<i>is still on the loose.</i>

924
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:04,245
...Rita manages to create Goldar...
Are you listening to me?

925
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,376
And he rips the crystal from the ground,

926
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,847
it'll be like 10,000 nuclear bombs
washing over Earth.

927
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,240
Supposed to freak us out?

928
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,408
You keep making this harder.
We're busting our asses.

929
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,160
Feel free to throw us a bone
at some point.

930
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,885
Yes, I see you busting your "asses."

931
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,531
So I've decided
to give you some inspiration.

932
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,969
What you will find beyond this wall
will forever change your lives.

933
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,280
Come on.

934
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,324
The Zords!

935
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:33,930
- Pretty cool, right'?
- Yeah.

936
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,001
They take on the form

937
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,048
of the most powerful organism
on the planet.

938
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:41,250
When these Zords formed,
dinosaurs reigned supreme.

939
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,721
They will be an extension of you.

940
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,804
And their power... is all but limitless.

941
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,367
But you're not ready for this power.

942
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:54,441
When you morph,

943
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:57,330
your armor will make you one
with the Zords.

944
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,289
So come on, let's go train.

945
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:02,250
Today's the day you become rangers!
I can feel it!

946
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:07,081
- Okay.
- Let's go.

947
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,561
Yeah. Let's go.

948
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,201
This was a bad idea.

949
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,607
Okay, okay, uh, signals, brakes.

950
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:21,841
Brakes, I need brakes!

951
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,888
Manual. Man-u-al.

952
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:27,123
Where are the brakes... Alpha 5!

953
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,250
Ahh! Oh, crap!

954
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,687
Hey! Move! Move!

955
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,000
Out of the way!

956
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:39,442
<i>♪ Go tell it on the mountain ♪</i>

957
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,856
You have to remember
that in today's training lesson

958
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,291
the important thing is to...

959
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,011
- Wait. Where's Zack?
- Seriously?

960
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,808
Run, run, run! Run!

961
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,048
Run! Run!

962
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:00,365
It's bad!

963
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,161
You all right?

964
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:13,404
Ay, ay, ay!

965
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:16,450
All right, my bad, my bad.
That's on me, right there.

966
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:17,851
What's your problem?

967
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:20,008
You could've killed yourself. Or us.

968
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,650
- Back off, bossman.
- Hey!

969
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,086
Oh, come on, guys. Wow.

970
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,696
- Guys, guys, guys, come on!
- Watch it!

971
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,324
Wait. What are you doing?

972
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,330
Just stop fighting, please!

973
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:44,486
What?

974
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,483
That's dope.

975
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,562
What? I got something on my f...

976
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,768
- Yeah!
- Whoa!

977
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:54,684
Okay, now that's cool! Oh, yeah!

978
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,216
- Hold still.
- Don't touch it. Zack, don't touch it.

979
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:57,571
Zack, do not touch it.

980
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,730
Whoa!

981
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:03,007
Where'd it go? Bring it back.

982
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,242
Bring it back, dude.

983
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,321
<i>Get out.</i>

984
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,483
<i>Training is over for today. Go home.</i>

985
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,927
I'm sorry, he just morphed.

986
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,331
He did it. You saw it, right?

987
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:14,561
<i>Do it again.</i>

988
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,961
<i>All of you. Any of you.</i>

989
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:20,442
- Billy. How'd you do it, Billy?
- Come on, Billy, let's do it.

990
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,960
- Show us what you did.
- Come on. Do it again.

991
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:28,290
- Do it again!
- I'm trying, I'm trying! I can't focus!

992
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:31,409
Billy, how'd you do it? Show us.

993
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,764
Okay, we don't know how.

994
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,285
<i>That's what I thought.</i>

995
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:40,126
<i>If you can't morph, you are not rangers.</i>

996
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,407
<i>Go home. All of you.</i>

997
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,201
Now what?

998
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,327
Damn.

999
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,164
Seriously?

1000
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:56,721
Hey, guys...

1001
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,883
guys, look, uh...
I'ma stay up here tonight.

1002
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:04,170
Make a fire. I got some food
if you guys wanna stay.

1003
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,886
I'm down.

1004
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:10,561
All right. Cool.

1005
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:14,725
Jason's team is failing.
I shall destroy Rita myself.

1006
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:17,531
There must be a way to free me
from this wall.

1007
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:22,447
Yes, but the irony is,
is that you need these rangers to morph.

1008
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,522
If they morph, you can harness that energy

1009
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,001
to regenerate your body
and come back through.

1010
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,321
There's got to be
another way! I can't...

1011
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,641
What, Zordon? You can't what?

1012
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,446
Wait for us dumb kids to morph
so that you can come back to life?

1013
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,329
That's what all this
has been about, right?

1014
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,084
You coming back?

1015
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:42,209
This has only ever been
about protecting the crystal.

1016
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,203
Rita could be building Goldar as we speak.

1017
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:47,887
- Don't underestimate me or my team.
- You can't stop him.

1018
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:53,091
She will have him dig up the crystal
and life on earth will die.

1019
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,201
And we need you.

1020
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,376
Because you were so successful
at stopping her last time.

1021
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:00,370
I died burying those coins

1022
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:03,808
in hopes that they would find
the next real rangers.

1023
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,048
Those who are worthy.

1024
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:07,884
Well, sorry to disappoint you.

1025
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:10,884
I don't need to stand here
and have you tell me what I did wrong.

1026
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:15,887
- I can go home and get that.
- Jason, you need me out of this wall.

1027
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,724
To help lead this team!

1028
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,928
Your team's dead.

1029
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,161
And you're just as scared as we are.

1030
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:32,964
These... are all 24 karat gold bands.

1031
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:34,776
Hello, I'll be right with you.

1032
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:37,485
They're at the top of your budget...

1033
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,087
I'll get you anything you want.

1034
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:44,004
Aw. You're so sweet.

1035
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:45,809
Get my cookie anything she wants.

1036
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,124
I'll be right back.

1037
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:55,087
Uh... can I help you?

1038
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:57,806
Gold.

1039
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,003
I'm interested...

1040
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:02,081
in gold.

1041
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,121
Yeah.

1042
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,171
We have some very nice pieces here.

1043
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:28,889
Come closer.

1044
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,167
- Closer. Closer. Closer.
- Oh...

1045
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:41,041
- This. Give it to me!
- Of course!

1046
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,485
Okay. Here you go.

1047
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,565
Ah...

1048
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,401
Grow.

1049
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,291
Grow.

1050
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:00,961
More!

1051
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:06,096
Police! Don't move!

1052
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:09,681
Drop your... weapon,
and put your hands on your head.

1053
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:10,807
Do it now!

1054
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,524
Do what I say, lady!

1055
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:16,161
Lady... I like the sound of "lady."

1056
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,016
Get on the ground
and you won't get hurt.

1057
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:33,171
Unit five, I need backup
at Fenix Jewelers.

1058
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:35,766
Shots fired. I repeat, shots fired.

1059
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:38,241
Get down!

1060
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:50,281
It's been too long
since I raised my beautiful creatures.

1061
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,767
Did you miss me?

1062
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:04,684
Oh, my God.

1063
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,569
Kill him!

1064
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:11,856
All right.

1065
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,291
If I weren't stuck in this wall,

1066
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,641
I would eat that junk food!

1067
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,569
What happened back there?

1068
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,529
Nothing. Don't worry about it.

1069
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,204
Billy, how'd you do it?

1070
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,565
How'd you morph?

1071
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,324
I don't know.

1072
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:33,449
What are you guys thinking about
when we're trying to morph?

1073
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:37,206
You must shed
your masks to wear this armor.

1074
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:41,803
Think only of each other

1075
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,928
and the morphing grid will open to you.

1076
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,081
Yeah, that's better.

1077
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:49,091
Well, maybe it's because
we don't know each other.

1078
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:50,810
Maybe that's why we can't morph.

1079
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:54,565
Okay.

1080
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:57,962
No, I'm serious. Let's do this. For real.

1081
01:08:58,040 --> 01:08:59,610
- What?
- I'm Zack.

1082
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:02,001
And I am a Power Ranger.

1083
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,720
Hi, Zack.

1084
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:11,931
Truth: I live
in the Melody Mobile Home Park.

1085
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:13,246
It's just me and my mom.

1086
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,924
And my mom?

1087
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,889
My mom is the best!

1088
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:24,163
But my mom, she's sick.

1089
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:26,730
I do what I can, but...

1090
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,081
but I'm scared.

1091
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:33,050
Sometimes I get too scared
to stay there at night, 'cause...

1092
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,891
'cause I'm afraid she can't make it.

1093
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,364
And if she goes...

1094
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:43,770
when she goes,

1095
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:46,890
I got nobody else.

1096
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:55,922
Look, I think
being with you guys is good for me.

1097
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,361
Let's do that.

1098
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,522
Let's tell our secrets.
It'll... it'll help us.

1099
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:03,806
Okay, I got a secret.

1100
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:08,130
- I like country music.
- What?

1101
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:09,929
No, matter of fact, I love country music.

1102
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:13,566
And I don't...

1103
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:15,971
I don't miss my dad as much.

1104
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,808
I mean, coming to the mine
with him was all I had.

1105
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:26,648
But coming to the mine
with you guys is just as good.

1106
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,449
Yeah.

1107
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,761
Bigger secret is why
were you in detention?

1108
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,888
- I blew up my lunchbox.
- What?

1109
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:35,247
What, it was a accident, okay?

1110
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:38,164
- Of course.
- My lunchbox was in my locker.

1111
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:40,641
Boom goes the lunchbox,
in detention goes Billy.

1112
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:44,645
But let's not forget that Kimberly Hart
was also in... in detention, too, so...

1113
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:49,006
Not tonight.

1114
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:51,321
Skip me.

1115
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:55,681
What about you, dude?

1116
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,842
Why don't you tell us
who you really are?

1117
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:01,241
Because everyone knows exactly who I am.

1118
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,806
Okay.

1119
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,006
What about you, crazy girl?

1120
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:08,209
I could tell you anything
and you'd have to believe me.

1121
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:15,447
Okay, um...

1122
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,683
I'm the new girl. Always.

1123
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,362
Three schools in three years.

1124
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:27,570
What's crazy is I like it that way.
You know, it's just easier.

1125
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:30,086
Nobody ever has to
get to know me and uh,

1126
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:33,642
my parents don't have to worry
about my relationships.

1127
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:36,810
Boyfriend troubles?

1128
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:40,885
Yeah. Boyfriend troubles.

1129
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:45,085
Girlfriend troubles?

1130
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:54,642
My family is so normal.

1131
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:55,881
Too normal.

1132
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:00,684
They believe in labels.

1133
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:07,608
They'd like for me to, um...
dress differently.

1134
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,251
Talk more.

1135
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:14,885
Have the kind of friends
they want me to have.

1136
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:20,287
It's just... I don't know how to tell them
what's really going on with me.

1137
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,491
And I've never said any of this out loud.

1138
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:30,723
Well, it's cool. You're with us now.

1139
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,441
Am I?

1140
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:37,611
What does that mean?

1141
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:39,364
When all this is over.

1142
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:42,524
Are we Power Rangers or...

1143
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,564
are we friends?

1144
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:13,964
Do you know who I am?

1145
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,325
Yes.

1146
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,802
I was once just like you.

1147
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:24,406
So pretty.

1148
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,926
Innocent

1149
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:31,210
Are all the rangers on Zordon's new team
as young as you?

1150
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,405
Delightful!

1151
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:37,850
Have you morphed yet?

1152
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,850
Trick question.

1153
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,048
If you could morph,

1154
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:48,284
we'd be having
a very different conversation.

1155
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:52,724
Mmm. The Yellow Ranger.

1156
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,768
Should I kill you?

1157
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:58,606
I killed the Yellow Ranger... before.

1158
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:01,411
And I loved it!

1159
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:04,211
Oh, you want your armor.

1160
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:08,330
I'll show you mine,
if you show me yours.

1161
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:27,449
No, please, you're hurting me!
You're so strong!

1162
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,808
I'm just kidding.

1163
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:34,886
You've got spunk, little Yellow.

1164
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,485
I see myself in you.

1165
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:40,485
I was an outsider on Zordon's
team just like you.

1166
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:45,361
All I need to know is,
where is the Zeo Crystal?

1167
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,568
I don't know.

1168
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:49,971
Sadly, I believe you.

1169
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:54,170
Tomorrow, I am going to destroy
Angel Grove.

1170
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,766
But, in exchange for your life,

1171
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:00,925
you will find out where that crystal is,
and you will come to me.

1172
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,650
We can have a little deal,

1173
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,768
Didi, my friend.

1174
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,688
- Shh! It's me.
- Kim.

1175
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,524
How did you get in here?

1176
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:25,729
I'm a superhero.
And you left your window open.

1177
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,290
Is everything okay?

1178
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,281
I think I'm the reason we can't morph.

1179
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,283
I haven't really been honest.

1180
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:38,284
Okay. I punched Ty Fleming in the face

1181
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:42,285
because he told everyone
I was the meanest person he'd ever met.

1182
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:43,486
And he was right.

1183
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:44,931
Well, that can't be true.

1184
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,650
Okay.

1185
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:49,889
Whoa.

1186
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:52,122
- You took that picture?
- No.

1187
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:55,409
Amanda Clark took that picture.
Of herself.

1188
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:59,724
But she shared it with me.
Privately. She trusted me.

1189
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:02,246
And you sent that pic to... to Ty?

1190
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,846
With a text that said,

1191
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:06,896
"Is this the girl you wanna
bring home to your mom?"

1192
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:08,445
Oh.

1193
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:11,683
I didn't realize how mean
it was until I saw her face.

1194
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,889
Kim, there's literally thousands of photos
going around school.

1195
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:19,010
I don't care about them.
I care about this. I did this.

1196
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,924
I had to sit in Mr. Detmer's
office with Amanda's father

1197
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,004
and watch as they showed him
that photo of his daughter.

1198
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,686
In his eyes, for the first time,
I could see who I'd become.

1199
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:34,526
You know, so I lied.
I blamed everyone else.

1200
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:37,569
I wanted to die, that's why...

1201
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:40,689
that's why when you asked me to run away,
I was ready.

1202
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:44,685
Okay, listen. Start over.
Erase that picture right now.

1203
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:47,684
- Jason, it can't be erased.
- Then live with it.

1204
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,411
You did an awful thing.
It doesn't make you an awful person.

1205
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,162
Just be the person you wanna be.

1206
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,526
So, we all got the same text.
So where is she?

1207
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:15,051
I'm here.

1208
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,930
Look, Rita came to my house tonight.

1209
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,650
- What?
- Yeah. She's real...

1210
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:24,490
insane.

1211
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,324
She nearly killed me.

1212
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,880
She was trying to get me to join her.

1213
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,122
She said she'd spare my life,
if I could keep a secret.

1214
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:32,201
What secret?

1215
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:35,409
At dawn, the destruction
of Angel Grove begins.

1216
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:37,608
This is real. This is the end.

1217
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:38,841
No, it's not. Where is she?

1218
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:41,002
She said to meet her
where the dead ships live.

1219
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:43,924
Okay. That's the boatyard
by the docks, right?

1220
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,160
- Let's go.
- What?

1221
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,807
Are you serious? No one?

1222
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,609
Jason, we're not even Power Rangers yet.

1223
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:56,330
I say we go back to Zordon.

1224
01:17:56,440 --> 01:18:00,161
Okay, the only reason Zordon
wanted us to become Power Rangers

1225
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:01,969
is so that he can come back to life.

1226
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:03,166
What makes you say that?

1227
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,850
Because he told me.

1228
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,570
Wait, so this all is a lie?

1229
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,449
Of course it was a lie, Billy.

1230
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:09,760
We failed.

1231
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:13,731
Let's stop being delusional
about being a team of superheroes.

1232
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:16,280
We're all screw-ups.

1233
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:19,682
And as much as I hate this scrubby,
bullshit town,

1234
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,889
I don't wanna just sit around
and watch it die, okay?

1235
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:26,691
Let's go and do the one thing
that's been asked of us

1236
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:28,125
and kill Rita.

1237
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:34,280
You know this is a really bad idea, right?

1238
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:35,725
The worst.

1239
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,565
Let's vote. Show of hands.

1240
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:57,446
Let's do it.

1241
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:31,051
Okay. Okay, let's go.

1242
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,336
Take the left,
I'll take the right.

1243
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,850
Okay. Got it.

1244
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:44,044
- We'll, untie him. Hold this.
- No, no, no.

1245
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:46,441
Let's just think about this, okay?

1246
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:47,760
Oh, shit!

1247
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,403
Right on time.

1248
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,607
I was beginning to think
you were too dumb

1249
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:59,921
to know where the dead ships live.

1250
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:03,440
Let's play.

1251
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:33,967
Five little rangers tied up like fish.

1252
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:40,322
The leader? Oh, hello, Red.

1253
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,880
Oh!

1254
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,486
You're not entirely disappointing.

1255
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:49,406
Oh, look at you.
Trying to figure out my plan.

1256
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:50,686
I'll just tell you.

1257
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:54,162
Yellow has led you to your deaths.

1258
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:56,891
Because I'm going to kill you,

1259
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:02,124
one by one, until you tell me,

1260
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:03,725
where is my crystal?

1261
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:05,165
We don't know.

1262
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:08,403
No, Red. You don't know!

1263
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,369
But guess what?

1264
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:12,283
One of you does.

1265
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,123
Who could it be?

1266
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,806
Eenie, meenie, miney...

1267
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:20,126
Blue.

1268
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:25,043
Blue, so loyal.

1269
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:26,281
Pure of heart.

1270
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:29,483
Tell the class what you know!

1271
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:32,040
Where's my crystal?

1272
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:36,525
You can tell me now, Blue,

1273
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:40,605
or you can tell me after I kill
all of your friends.

1274
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:44,561
Let's start with Black.

1275
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,722
No! Stop!

1276
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:47,847
No.

1277
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:53,006
He dies in three, two...

1278
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:55,730
Okay! Okay!

1279
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:58,296
Don't hurt my friends, all right?

1280
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,288
It's at a dining establishment.

1281
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:02,931
Where? What does that mean?
What's it called?

1282
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,240
It's a Krispy Kreme.

1283
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:08,005
- Krispy Kreme?
- Krispy Kreme.

1284
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:09,366
This is a special place?

1285
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,727
- Very special.
- It must be.

1286
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:14,326
The source of life itself is buried there.

1287
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:17,961
Thank you, Blue, for being so weak.

1288
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:22,284
Zordon would lose all respect
for me if I don't kill you.

1289
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:24,203
- At least one of you.
- What?

1290
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:27,764
No! Billy!

1291
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:32,640
- Billy!
- Billy!

1292
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:35,724
- Jason, we gotta help him!
- Billy! Billy!

1293
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:41,769
You're not ready to kill me.

1294
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,007
Ha! You're not worthy.

1295
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:49,570
Quick! Get the rope!

1296
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:55,401
Billy!

1297
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:05,121
Billy?

1298
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:06,406
He's gonna be okay, right?

1299
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:09,331
Come on.

1300
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:12,563
Hey, hey. You got this, big guy. Come on.

1301
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:15,480
He's dead.

1302
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:25,685
He's dead.

1303
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:27,000
No.

1304
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:45,406
Pick him up.

1305
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:48,849
Help me pick him up!

1306
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:52,601
Come on!

1307
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:21,001
Okay. Okay. Come on, Billy.
We got you, buddy.

1308
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:23,048
Take him. Take him.

1309
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:25,766
Yeah.

1310
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:47,923
- Let's just put him down.
- Okay.

1311
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:50,922
- Slow, slow, slow.
- Master Billy.

1312
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,684
Do something, okay?

1313
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,256
There must be something
you can do for him.

1314
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:57,681
I told you that you were not ready.

1315
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:01,924
Zordon, please help us, okay? Please.

1316
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,002
There's nothing that I could do for him.

1317
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,806
We were both reckless with our teams.

1318
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:15,486
No.

1319
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:19,971
I'm sorry.

1320
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:26,686
I'm sorry, guys.

1321
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,922
He's dead because of me.

1322
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:33,964
No, Jason, it was all of us.

1323
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:36,646
No, I pushed it.

1324
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:39,326
And as usual I made the wrong decision.

1325
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:41,368
Out of... out of fear, anger...

1326
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:45,600
I don't know, I was just so angry.

1327
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:50,727
He's... he's a great kid, you know?

1328
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,164
And he loved us.

1329
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:57,210
He loved... being a ranger.

1330
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:01,450
I'm sorry, Billy.

1331
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:05,760
I'd trade my life for yours if I could.

1332
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:17,767
Maybe he traded his life for us.

1333
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:20,609
Yeah. Probably did.

1334
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:28,291
I would.

1335
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,246
Me too.

1336
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,090
Yeah. Me too.

1337
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:39,086
Me too.

1338
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:43,445
It's just the four of us now.

1339
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:50,080
The truth is,

1340
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:54,090
whatever we've said to each other,

1341
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:55,241
it doesn't matter.

1342
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:00,681
This. This is the only thing that matters.

1343
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:05,765
She's right.

1344
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,886
Zordon! Zordon!
Look at the grid!

1345
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:16,691
This is your time! Do... do you see it?

1346
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:18,683
The grid is open! Step through!

1347
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:21,604
Yes, I see it. I see it.

1348
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:26,646
Step through, Zordon!

1349
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:29,127
- Hey!
- What's happening?

1350
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:30,929
The morphing grid is open!

1351
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,889
What's going on?

1352
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:46,524
Zordon? Master?

1353
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:49,601
Where is he?

1354
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:51,808
He must have
stepped through the grid.

1355
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:53,370
Alpha, where'd he go?

1356
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:54,851
I don't know where he is.

1357
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:00,724
Zordon, what?
Why didn't you step though?

1358
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,325
That was your only chance.

1359
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:03,481
I know.

1360
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:07,165
But only one can come back.

1361
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,005
Billy!

1362
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:19,129
- Billy!
- Oh, my God! Hey!

1363
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:22,846
Are you okay?

1364
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:29,131
- Did I die?
- Yes.

1365
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:30,480
- No.
- Little bit.

1366
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:32,289
And you guys brought me back to life.

1367
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,604
I told you we were superheroes.

1368
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:39,331
There can only be one Red Ranger.

1369
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:44,166
Jason, this is your time.

1370
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:46,971
This is your team.

1371
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:48,087
Thank you.

1372
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:52,563
Dude. That was loopy.

1373
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:54,205
Seein' my dad.

1374
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:11,489
Welcome back, my friend.

1375
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:16,327
- Oh, we gotta go to Krispy Kreme, Jason.
- What?

1376
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,606
Not for donuts.

1377
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,090
Okay. Let's try this.

1378
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,045
Thank you, Zordon.

1379
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:47,688
It's morphin' time.

1380
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:22,162
Who is that?

1381
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:29,640
Oh, my God!

1382
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,251
Yes.

1383
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:37,045
Come back to me, Goldar.

1384
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,643
Come back.

1385
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:55,282
Hold up. Look.

1386
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:08,888
All right. Let's do this.

1387
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:43,806
Yes!

1388
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:47,766
Yee-haw!

1389
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:49,683
Whoa, this is so much better with armor.

1390
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:55,361
Come on! Bring it on!

1391
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:58,126
Hey, heads up!

1392
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:10,163
Guys, they just keep coming.

1393
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:11,924
There's too many of them.

1394
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,176
You guys hold them off.

1395
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:14,770
Zack, where are you going?

1396
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:15,887
Whoo-hoo!

1397
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:22,008
Make my monster grow!

1398
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:30,766
I've missed you, my friend.

1399
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:37,256
They're gonna push us
off the edge!

1400
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:38,930
Incoming!

1401
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:50,041
Let's kill everyone.

1402
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:53,205
Did you guys see that?

1403
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:57,091
All right, who wants me
to pimp their ride, too?

1404
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:04,047
Uh, guys? We're too late.

1405
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:08,521
Oh, man.

1406
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:12,082
That's... that's a lotta gold.

1407
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:14,731
We're gonna
protect the crystal, right?

1408
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:18,766
- We're going to Angel Grove.
- Let's get the Zords.

1409
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:22,202
This is a lot different than the van.

1410
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:30,204
Whoo!

1411
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:32,328
Yippie-kay-yay, motherfu...

1412
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,084
Mother's good. Mother's good.

1413
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:35,764
Go, go, Power Rangers!

1414
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:45,536
I'm not going
the right way! What?

1415
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:46,891
Jason, I'm going backwards.

1416
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:55,729
Guys... our town. She's destroying it.

1417
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:59,928
Krispy Kreme!

1418
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,570
Not there.

1419
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:08,404
Rita and her golden boy
haven't found Krispy Kreme yet.

1420
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:09,856
Okay, Kim,
you hold them there.

1421
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:12,884
Zack, Billy, you circle the Krispy Kreme
and make sure it's safe.

1422
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:14,200
I'm headed straight for Goldar.

1423
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:15,760
Copy! I'll hold her off.

1424
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:17,640
Kim, I'll go with you.

1425
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:19,165
Let's go, boys.

1426
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:20,696
Billy, just the two of us.

1427
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:22,370
I'm right behind you.

1428
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:24,721
Oops.

1429
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:28,926
Surprise.

1430
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:42,530
How cute.

1431
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:46,446
The rangers found their costumes
and their dino-cars.

1432
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:49,444
Well, let's give them something else
to play with.

1433
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:01,645
Crush them!

1434
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:07,484
How many does she need?

1435
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:08,800
This is insane.

1436
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:12,600
Take that!

1437
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:18,842
Okay. Let's try this!

1438
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:24,486
Sorry, Bumblebee! Whoo!

1439
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:25,561
Yeah!

1440
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:35,290
I can't get 'em off!

1441
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,124
Turn your head. Trust me.

1442
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,163
Okay. Thanks, Kim.

1443
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:44,526
That's all right.

1444
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:51,131
That's what you get.

1445
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:56,560
Whoo!

1446
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:11,170
The crystal.

1447
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:14,966
She just found the crystal.

1448
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:17,247
Okay, come on, let's move!

1449
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:30,096
I'll take Goldar
from the right.

1450
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:32,043
J! I'm right behind you.

1451
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:33,451
Come on!

1452
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:40,046
Jason, it's your dad.

1453
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:41,724
I'm looking for you. I'm downtown.

1454
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:43,848
I'm at Mariner Bay and Reefside.

1455
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:46,008
Call me back soon as you get this.

1456
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:48,601
How's that feel?

1457
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:51,889
We got this. Come on!

1458
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,800
- No!
- No!

1459
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:56,966
I'm coming!

1460
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:08,485
Ahh!

1461
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:44,885
Help!

1462
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:50,041
Give me your hand.

1463
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:51,326
Help!

1464
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:55,371
- Sam! Look at me.
- Huh?

1465
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:57,169
It's okay.

1466
01:38:58,360 --> 01:38:59,805
Give me your hand.

1467
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:10,526
Dig. Dig, Goldar.

1468
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:14,844
Me and Zack are gonna try
to push Goldar to the water.

1469
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:29,201
We're okay.
I'm okay. Go.

1470
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:33,761
Guys, help!

1471
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:36,650
Billy, I have an idea. Ready?

1472
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:39,200
Uh... Yeah? For what exactly?

1473
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,490
Oh-ho-ho!

1474
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:51,610
I don't know what to press, okay?

1475
01:39:56,160 --> 01:39:58,367
Open wide, Rita.

1476
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:02,206
Let me try...

1477
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:34,289
Hey, Billy, you okay?

1478
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:35,486
Yeah, I'm okay.

1479
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:36,846
That was crazy brave, dude.

1480
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:38,365
Did we do it?

1481
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:40,761
Did we... did we win?

1482
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:42,080
Yeah!

1483
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,604
I feel the crystal.

1484
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:16,966
She's back.

1485
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:33,926
That's incredible.

1486
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,764
Oh, my God.

1487
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:37,966
Come on, let's go!

1488
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,120
Okay, everyone.

1489
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:49,210
Hold the line.

1490
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:03,490
Okay.

1491
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:04,925
We got this.

1492
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:06,490
Come on!

1493
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:10,804
Crush them!

1494
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:12,405
Okay, fire!

1495
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,206
Yeah!

1496
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:22,290
Come on, guys!

1497
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:30,081
Ohh!

1498
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:36,566
If you must come at me...
come at me, bro!

1499
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:38,005
Watch out! Billy!

1500
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:44,721
Okay.

1501
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:48,683
Yes!

1502
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:53,122
Jason, I'm coming in.

1503
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:55,123
Kim! I got your back.

1504
01:42:58,840 --> 01:42:59,841
I got you.

1505
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:13,967
I'm burning.

1506
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:16,811
I can't... I can't breathe.

1507
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:28,208
He's crushing me!

1508
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:30,328
Push them into the pit!

1509
01:43:32,360 --> 01:43:33,616
Guys, we're sliding!

1510
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:36,962
- Come on, everybody, hold the line!
- Fight back!

1511
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:42,576
It's getting too hot, guys.

1512
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:44,280
I don't know how much longer
I can hold it.

1513
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:49,246
No one dies alone.

1514
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:50,845
I'm okay with that.

1515
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:05,491
Hold the line. Hold the line.

1516
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:07,760
Hold the line.

1517
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:09,842
Zack! Zack, stay with me,
Zack. Come on.

1518
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:28,009
Thank you for being my friends.

1519
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:32,844
Hold on to each other.

1520
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:54,323
Get my crystal!

1521
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:37,211
We're alive.

1522
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:40,563
Guys, we're alive!

1523
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:43,564
We're like one big, uh... one big Zord.
Like a mama Zord.

1524
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:46,689
- What?
- No, no, no. That sounds lame. Um...

1525
01:45:46,760 --> 01:45:47,761
a Megazord!

1526
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:53,041
How?

1527
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:14,407
Whoa.

1528
01:46:24,280 --> 01:46:25,281
What?

1529
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:33,888
Oh, shit.

1530
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:35,530
Bring it on.

1531
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:37,489
Everyone, let's go!

1532
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:45,449
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1533
01:46:47,240 --> 01:46:49,242
Whoa, whoa, no, no, no, no!

1534
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:52,536
That might
have been my fault. I'm sorry, y'all.

1535
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:53,976
I think Kimberly
needs to move our feet.

1536
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,606
- No, I've got the arm.
- Uh, no, I do. I've got the leg.

1537
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:58,529
- You're a leg, too?
- I have the arm.

1538
01:46:58,640 --> 01:47:00,210
We all have to move together.

1539
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:01,645
I'll lift us.

1540
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:06,802
All together on three.

1541
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:10,680
One, two, three!

1542
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:11,896
We got this! Come on!

1543
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:16,730
Zack, catch us.

1544
01:47:22,640 --> 01:47:25,120
Let's go again!

1545
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:27,567
Kimberly, throw a hook! Now!

1546
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:31,401
Whoo!

1547
01:47:35,080 --> 01:47:36,216
Oh, I wish I could punch.

1548
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:42,689
Nice one, Billy!

1549
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:52,285
Jason, we got anything for that?

1550
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:54,209
Remember the pit?

1551
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:55,810
Yeah.

1552
01:47:55,880 --> 01:47:56,881
Hey, I hate the pit!

1553
01:48:01,240 --> 01:48:02,571
- Ready?
- Ready.

1554
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:04,529
- Ready.
- Ready.

1555
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:06,409
Ready.

1556
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:07,481
Now!

1557
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:10,481
Slip!

1558
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:13,844
Grab!

1559
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:16,649
Lift!

1560
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:28,486
Kim, Trini,
pull back on the arms.

1561
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:30,324
We've got swords.

1562
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:43,926
Ha!

1563
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:47,282
Wait!

1564
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:49,611
Guys...

1565
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:55,243
Look at me.

1566
01:48:57,800 --> 01:48:59,450
You think you've won?

1567
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:03,205
I came for the crystal.

1568
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:05,760
Others will come!

1569
01:49:06,760 --> 01:49:10,731
What you have... it can't last.

1570
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:14,403
You know I'm right!

1571
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:17,529
- No.
- No.

1572
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:20,285
<i>I don't know. But for now,</i>

1573
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:23,011
<i>I need you to give your staff
and your coin to us.</i>

1574
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:26,721
And we'll take you to Zordon
and let him be the judge.

1575
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:30,771
Zordon? Judge me?

1576
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,689
Never!

1577
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:38,321
No matter what Zordon says,

1578
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:42,371
I know I am worthy!

1579
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:46,725
Trini! Now!

1580
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:05,410
Jason, did you just slap her?

1581
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:08,131
I did. Weird, right?

1582
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:12,210
That's cool.

1583
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:13,441
I guess the bully...

1584
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:17,286
you guys don't get...
It's the... I got it, buddy.

1585
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:19,408
Oh, that was scary.

1586
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:27,205
We did it.

1587
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:47,925
I told you we'd be famous.

1588
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,331
Is that Principal Feig?

1589
01:50:51,120 --> 01:50:54,283
Hey. No, I... I don't think he can see me.

1590
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:17,041
Oh, let's wiggle, Jason.

1591
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:21,126
I call this the algebra. Woo!

1592
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:22,680
How do you even do that?

1593
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:31,568
You should keep that.

1594
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:34,565
You've earned it.

1595
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:37,370
I'll come back for it.

1596
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:40,444
That was terrifying. See you, buddy.

1597
01:51:54,440 --> 01:51:56,096
Jeremy Franklin
told everyone at school.

1598
01:51:56,120 --> 01:51:58,360
The blue was the best one.
That's who I wanna be.

1599
01:51:58,440 --> 01:51:59,776
Hey, no,
I wanna be the blue one!

1600
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:01,086
I wanna be blue one.

1601
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:04,004
Hey, how about one of you guys
try to be the yellow one?

1602
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:07,402
Oh, yeah, the yellow one!
Oh, he's so cool!

1603
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:10,164
How do you know it's a he?

1604
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:34,330
Checkmate.

1605
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:43,771
Billy! Jason Scott is here

1606
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:46,161
and Kimberly Hart and Zack Taylor

1607
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:48,089
and some girl named Didi.

1608
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:50,561
Mom, it's Trini! I'm coming! I'm coming!

1609
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,209
<i>This ranger team
did what my team could not.</i>

1610
01:52:58,520 --> 01:53:01,967
<i>You will humbly walk amongst your peers,</i>

1611
01:53:02,040 --> 01:53:04,407
<i>but heroes you all will be.</i>

1612
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:07,211
- Attention! Attention in detention.
<i>- Each of your names</i>

1613
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:10,727
<i>will be etched alongside
the great ranger teams before you.</i>

1614
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:17,006
<i>I will always owe a debt
of gratitude to you all.</i>

1615
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:33,524
<i>Oh, we have
a new detention student.</i>

1616
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:35,602
"Tommy Oliver."

1617
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:38,087
Tommy Oliver?

1618
01:55:40,360 --> 01:55:41,885
Tommy Oliver!

1619
01:55:43,560 --> 01:55:45,130
Tommy Oliver?

1620
01:55:46,160 --> 01:55:47,685
Tommy Oliver!

1621
01:55:51,560 --> 01:55:52,607
Cranston.

1622
01:55:52,680 --> 01:55:53,816
That might have been my fault.

1623
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:55,560
That might have been my fault,
I'm so sorry.
