3
00:01:36,257 --> 00:01:37,596
Got to get up.

4
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:38,853
I'm working on it.

5
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:40,132
Seriously, Jeb,
it's time to go.

6
00:01:41,593 --> 00:01:42,761
You found one for us?

7
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:57,544
What the hell?

8
00:01:57,679 --> 00:01:59,817
Storm's here, guys!
Let's go!

9
00:01:59,952 --> 00:02:01,384
Nah. Nah, it can't be.

10
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,079
God, I went
way too hard last night.

11
00:02:05,056 --> 00:02:06,614
Javi, get up. Come on.

12
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,688
Oh! Come on!

13
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:12,487
Where are
the trash bags?

14
00:02:12,623 --> 00:02:13,923
Oh. Found 'em.

15
00:02:14,058 --> 00:02:15,297
Jeb, are you sure
you're recording?

16
00:02:15,432 --> 00:02:17,231
- I don't see a red light.
- Oh.

17
00:02:17,366 --> 00:02:19,496
- Yeah. Recording.
- Okay.

18
00:02:19,631 --> 00:02:20,696
- Blah.

19
00:02:20,832 --> 00:02:22,598
Don't make me laugh. Stop it.

20
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:24,203
Okay.

21
00:02:24,339 --> 00:02:25,937
Today, our science team

22
00:02:26,073 --> 00:02:27,936
from the Tornado Tamer project
is out in the field,

23
00:02:28,072 --> 00:02:30,711
about to chase a storm
southwest of us.

24
00:02:30,846 --> 00:02:32,945
Our experiment is designed
to decrease the moisture

25
00:02:33,081 --> 00:02:35,087
inside of a tornado to see
if we can make it collapse.

26
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,012
Tell the folks
how you do that, Kate.

27
00:02:37,148 --> 00:02:38,919
Well, first, we got
to find a tornado

28
00:02:39,054 --> 00:02:40,857
to suck up our superabsorbent
polymers in these barrels...

29
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:42,691
Diapers.

30
00:02:42,827 --> 00:02:44,757
Tell them it's the same stuff
they use in diapers. Hmm.

31
00:02:44,892 --> 00:02:46,455
Oh, yeah.
It's nontoxic.

32
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:50,798
Uh, the Doppler doesn't show
a storm until the afternoon.

33
00:02:50,934 --> 00:02:52,601
The data doesn't see
what Kate sees, remember?

34
00:02:52,736 --> 00:02:54,969
How about Kate sees
a few more hours of sleep?

35
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,369
That might work.

36
00:02:56,504 --> 00:02:58,337
Praveen, what are you doing?

37
00:02:58,472 --> 00:02:59,968
Dorothy's not a desk.

38
00:03:00,104 --> 00:03:02,771
Come on.
Get in, get in, get in!

39
00:03:02,907 --> 00:03:04,643
Ready? You know what today is?

40
00:03:04,779 --> 00:03:07,718
The day we tame
a tornado!

41
00:03:10,154 --> 00:03:11,547
- Yeah!
- All right.

42
00:03:11,683 --> 00:03:13,218
I'm gonna yak first.

43
00:03:13,353 --> 00:03:15,056
Ow.

44
00:03:15,192 --> 00:03:16,754
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

Kate was right.
Southeast winds are picking up.

53
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,044
Here they are.

54
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,480
It's really building up.

- That's not a thing,
by the way.

58
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,498
- Hey, Mom. What's up?
Yes, it is.

59
00:03:57,634 --> 00:03:59,103
Yeah, yeah, just chasing
weather around.

60
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,668
- It's a thing.
Mm-mm.

61
00:04:00,803 --> 00:04:02,831
Yes, we'll be careful,
I promise.

62
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:04,207
Hey, Mrs. Carter.

63
00:04:04,342 --> 00:04:05,902
- Hey!
- Hey, Mrs. Carter!

64
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:08,338
- Hey, Mrs. Carter!
- We miss you.

65
00:04:08,473 --> 00:04:09,608
Hello.

66
00:04:09,743 --> 00:04:11,715
Okay, I'll tell 'em. Got to go.

67
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,812
Uh, she says there's barbecue
at the house when we're done.

68
00:04:13,948 --> 00:04:16,513
- Oh, yes. Thank you.
- Yes, Cathy. Yes.

69
00:04:20,653 --> 00:04:22,723
Man, I love Oklahoma.

70
00:04:22,859 --> 00:04:24,362
All right, how are we
getting to this thing?

71
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:25,820
<i>I'll need a southwest position</i>

72
00:04:25,956 --> 00:04:27,426
<i>to read my sensors.</i>

73
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:29,328
Yeah, coming right up.

74
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,270
- One Mississi--

75
00:04:38,405 --> 00:04:39,601
Oh.

76
00:04:41,612 --> 00:04:43,811
Oh, and the wind shear
is strong.

77
00:04:43,946 --> 00:04:47,216
Got some serious energy
building in there.

78
00:04:47,352 --> 00:04:49,244
Oh, hey. Hey, buckle up.

79
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,551
Don't...
Don't lean out the window.

80
00:04:50,686 --> 00:04:53,115
- Come on. Come back in.

81
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,988
Addy,
that's... Please?

82
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:58,262
Ever since you got struck
by lightning, you're no fun.

83
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,092
Yeah, well,
that's what happens.

84
00:05:00,228 --> 00:05:01,530
Mm.

85
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,293
Okay, we should get
the mixture ready.

86
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,594
Uh, don't you want to wait
for the rain to hit first?

87
00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:09,174
Okay, we should, um...

88
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,269
We should get
the mixture ready.

89
00:05:10,404 --> 00:05:11,508
Yes, we should.

90
00:05:19,615 --> 00:05:20,646
Jeb!
Yep.

91
00:05:20,781 --> 00:05:21,809
Come on!
Okay.

92
00:05:21,945 --> 00:05:23,488
I'm mixing.

93
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,249
You have to mix it.
- I got it, I got it.

94
00:05:25,384 --> 00:05:27,685
Here she is!
That should be enough.

95
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,292
All right.
- Okay.

96
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:30,428
- Okay, we're good.

97
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:33,590
Hey, hey, look.
Hey, gentle, gentle.

98
00:05:33,726 --> 00:05:35,290
Like... Right? Come on.

99
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,666
Now try.

100
00:05:40,903 --> 00:05:42,732
- Usually it works, but...

101
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:44,642
This thing is so old.

102
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:47,170
Like, I mean, it's old,
but it's field-tested,
you know?

103
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,971
Unlike Kate's science project
over here.

104
00:05:49,106 --> 00:05:51,046
It's <i>our</i> science project.

105
00:05:51,182 --> 00:05:52,848
No time, Javi.

106
00:05:52,984 --> 00:05:54,719
If Dorothy's not working,
then forget the data, okay?

107
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,652
- We'll worry about it later.
-"Forget the data"? What is...

108
00:05:56,787 --> 00:05:58,212
The tornado's not gonna wait
for us, Javi.

109
00:05:58,348 --> 00:05:59,752
There's a death ridge
setting in.

110
00:05:59,887 --> 00:06:01,857
Probably our last chase
of the season.

111
00:06:01,993 --> 00:06:03,494
No matter what, we got to get
these barrels in the air

112
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,186
and see if they can make
a tornado vanish, okay?

113
00:06:05,322 --> 00:06:07,194
- It's more important.

114
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:09,292
No, how about it's
equally as important
we do both, right?

115
00:06:09,427 --> 00:06:11,369
Look, look, if you make
a tornado vanish with this,

116
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,135
but you don't get the data
with this,

117
00:06:13,271 --> 00:06:14,201
who's gonna believe it?

118
00:06:14,336 --> 00:06:16,040
Oh. Got it.

119
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,807
Fine. Get us the numbers.

120
00:06:20,942 --> 00:06:22,614
Whatever we need to win
a big fat grant.

121
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,675
Well, I'm all about
my cash money, right?

122
00:06:24,811 --> 00:06:26,847
- Yeah.

123
00:06:34,021 --> 00:06:35,927
You ready?
Let's go!

124
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,891
Hey, be careful!

125
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,950
Uh, got a CAPE of 4,000.

126
00:07:02,086 --> 00:07:04,079
- 100 knots gate-to-gate
wind shear aloft.
- Come on.

127
00:07:04,214 --> 00:07:06,289
Give us a nice respectable EF1.

128
00:07:06,424 --> 00:07:07,719
I mean, EF2, we'll take it.

129
00:07:07,855 --> 00:07:09,050
Well, an EF2 would be too big.

130
00:07:09,185 --> 00:07:10,790
You have no faith, Praveen.

131
00:07:10,926 --> 00:07:13,432
Just no more
of those baby EF0s.

132
00:07:14,663 --> 00:07:16,193
Javi, how's Dorothy's GPS?

133
00:07:18,197 --> 00:07:20,131
Dorothy's coming in
loud and clear.

134
00:07:34,418 --> 00:07:35,987
Are we in the tornado?

135
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:40,415
No.

136
00:07:41,326 --> 00:07:42,417
No, it's behind us.

137
00:07:44,927 --> 00:07:46,588
- Okay.
- Wait, should I drive faster?

138
00:07:46,724 --> 00:07:48,960
No, no, no. We've got to drop
the barrels in its path.

139
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:50,258
Are... are we gonna see
the path?

140
00:07:50,393 --> 00:07:52,002
Whoa!

141
00:07:52,137 --> 00:07:53,472
No! Guys!

142
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,645
This is the path.

143
00:08:07,781 --> 00:08:09,080
How close is it?

144
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,321
That's a lot of lightning.

145
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:11,720
Okay, you guys stay here.

146
00:08:11,855 --> 00:08:13,150
- I'll get it.
Wait, wait.

147
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:14,856
Hey,
we got to help her, guys.

148
00:08:17,796 --> 00:08:19,623
It's spilling!
We got to hurry!

149
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:23,997
No, we need leverage to tip it!

150
00:08:25,995 --> 00:08:27,000
Jeb, hurry!

151
00:08:39,412 --> 00:08:41,852
Hey, Kate, you got
muscles and brain--

152
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,218
Brains.

153
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,661
Okay,
let's open them up.

154
00:08:52,527 --> 00:08:53,488
Come on.

155
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:56,997
Yeah!

156
00:08:59,369 --> 00:09:01,639
We're clear!

157
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,667
All right, we got it!
Let's go, let's go!

158
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:09,405
We got to go!

159
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:15,785
Okay, we dropped
the trailer, Javi.

160
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,526
- All right, let's see
if it takes the bait.
- Come on, come on, come on.

161
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:26,422
What if there's no tornado?

162
00:09:26,557 --> 00:09:28,666
What if it's just
a dense wave of hail?

163
00:09:36,873 --> 00:09:38,804
Whoo, baby!

164
00:09:38,939 --> 00:09:40,837
We just shot up 10,000 feet!

165
00:09:40,973 --> 00:09:42,236
- Yes!
- Yes!

166
00:09:42,372 --> 00:09:43,713
Okay, that's not a hail wave.

167
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:45,815
We did it, Kate.

168
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:51,617
- Wait, wait.

169
00:09:51,753 --> 00:09:53,214
It's getting closer.

170
00:09:55,753 --> 00:09:57,629
<i>Sensors rising, 30,000 feet.</i>

171
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,957
The... the polyacrylate
should be active now.

172
00:10:00,093 --> 00:10:01,656
Are the winds weakening, Javi?

173
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:04,803
Dorothy can't tell you that.
Lagrangian mechanics.

174
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,935
A moving sensor can't give you
the exact measurement

175
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,405
- of wind speed, but...

176
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,432
Ah, yeah! 40,000 feet.

177
00:10:11,568 --> 00:10:13,276
Your tornado
isn't shrinking, Kate.

178
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:14,811
<i>50,000 feet.</i>

179
00:10:17,975 --> 00:10:19,145
Holy shit.

180
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,919
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
This can't be right.

181
00:10:26,151 --> 00:10:27,582
<i>Javi, talk to us.</i>

182
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:29,991
Javi, talk to us.

183
00:10:32,594 --> 00:10:33,795
Talk to us.

184
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:35,830
Sensors just shot up
70,000 feet.

185
00:10:35,965 --> 00:10:38,060
- What?
- Uh, the... the NEXRAD velocity

186
00:10:38,195 --> 00:10:39,434
is 200 miles per hour.

187
00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:40,496
That's impossible.

188
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:43,400
Unless it's an EF5.

189
00:10:49,412 --> 00:10:50,978
Guys.

190
00:10:51,113 --> 00:10:53,079
Guys, whatever's in there,
it's big.

191
00:10:53,214 --> 00:10:54,950
It's big and it's moving fast.
Drive!

192
00:10:55,085 --> 00:10:56,982
<i>You got to get the hell
out of there!</i>

193
00:10:57,117 --> 00:10:58,916
- Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

194
00:10:59,052 --> 00:11:00,516
How did it become an EF5?

195
00:11:03,123 --> 00:11:04,190
It's getting closer!

196
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,363
Oh! Look out!

197
00:11:18,805 --> 00:11:19,671
Everybody okay?

198
00:11:23,748 --> 00:11:26,914
- We can't stay here.
- There!

199
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,144
Overpasses are the worst
in tornadoes.

200
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,348
What do we do?

201
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,457
This car's gonna fly. Come on!

202
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:44,867
<i>Jeb, Addy,
Praveen, Kate!</i>

203
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:46,204
<i>Guys, you got
to get out of there!</i>

204
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:47,530
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

205
00:11:48,097 --> 00:11:48,905
Kate!

206
00:12:11,463 --> 00:12:12,956
Come on.

207
00:12:27,512 --> 00:12:28,538
Kate, come on!

208
00:12:32,241 --> 00:12:33,213
Where's Praveen?

209
00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:36,282
Kate! Kate!

210
00:12:38,349 --> 00:12:40,081
- Come on!

211
00:12:40,216 --> 00:12:41,284
No, Kate!

212
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:42,893
Come on!

213
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,224
Addy! Addy!

214
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,396
- Come on!

215
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,433
Put your arms around the rail!

216
00:12:56,837 --> 00:13:00,308
Get in! Get in!

217
00:13:00,443 --> 00:13:03,072
Put your arms around the rail!
You're gonna be okay!

218
00:13:05,881 --> 00:13:07,848
It's gonna be okay!

219
00:13:07,984 --> 00:13:10,820
Keep holding on! I've got you!

220
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,652
I've got you, Kate!
I've got you!

221
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,624
Jeb!

222
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,699
<i>The next stop is 42nd Street.</i>

223
00:14:45,048 --> 00:14:46,743
Come along, everyone.

224
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:50,185
Our regional office focuses on
New York metro weather,

225
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,185
but we can see weather
around the country here.

226
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,092
Now, see these red outlines?

227
00:14:57,228 --> 00:14:59,357
We're having
extremely unusual activity

228
00:14:59,493 --> 00:15:01,165
in this region called
Tornado Alley.

229
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,726
- Is a tornado coming
to New York?
Oh, no.

230
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,367
Tornadoes are extremely rare
in New York.

231
00:15:06,503 --> 00:15:12,372
Though, we had an EF1
hit Brooklyn two years ago.

232
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,903
- Whoa.

233
00:15:16,038 --> 00:15:18,347
We have
20 full-time meteorologists...

234
00:15:18,483 --> 00:15:20,147
All right, looks like
we got some rain coming.

235
00:15:20,283 --> 00:15:21,947
Wind speed's currently
at 28 knots,

236
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,511
moving northeast at 15.

237
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,114
We should call in an advisory.

238
00:15:25,249 --> 00:15:26,882
Hey, Debra? De--

239
00:15:27,017 --> 00:15:28,921
The model projects
it's heading into Maryland.

240
00:15:29,057 --> 00:15:30,319
I'll make the call.

241
00:15:30,454 --> 00:15:32,623
Kate. What do you see?

242
00:15:36,864 --> 00:15:37,892
Um...

243
00:15:39,235 --> 00:15:41,428
Wind speeds have fallen
two knots.

244
00:15:41,564 --> 00:15:43,138
Structure is weakening.

245
00:15:43,273 --> 00:15:44,466
Looks like
it's all falling through.

246
00:15:44,602 --> 00:15:46,501
I think it's gonna lose steam.

247
00:15:46,637 --> 00:15:48,637
Let's hold off on any alerts.

248
00:15:48,772 --> 00:15:50,773
- Okay.
Keep an eye on it.

249
00:15:52,711 --> 00:15:54,344
Kate. There's a guy here
to see you.

250
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:55,778
He's in the conference room.

251
00:15:57,722 --> 00:15:58,990
Hi. I'm Kate.

252
00:16:03,353 --> 00:16:04,391
Hey, Kate.

253
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:08,323
Hey.

254
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,792
It's been a while.

255
00:16:13,964 --> 00:16:17,334
After graduation,
I went back to Miami.

256
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,837
Felt like I needed to regroup.

257
00:16:19,972 --> 00:16:22,505
Shit, you wouldn't believe it.
I joined the military.

258
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:24,640
- You joined the military?
- Yeah.

259
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,248
I was just feeling
kind of lost.

260
00:16:27,978 --> 00:16:30,318
I tried reaching out to you
a few times.

261
00:16:30,453 --> 00:16:33,517
Yeah, I'm not great
with communication.

262
00:16:33,652 --> 00:16:34,987
Yeah, I mean, you know,
I figured.

263
00:16:35,123 --> 00:16:37,028
You know, life and all.

264
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,656
But I hadn't heard from you,
so, you know,

265
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,461
I stopped by your mom's
in Sapulpa to check in.

266
00:16:40,596 --> 00:16:42,924
She said... she said
you don't come home anymore.

267
00:16:44,302 --> 00:16:46,694
I knew you moved,
but I didn't expect you

268
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,499
to move somewhere
like New York.

269
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:50,705
New York's great.
I like it here.

270
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,974
People are nice.

271
00:16:53,707 --> 00:16:55,537
Get your ass
out of the street!

272
00:16:55,673 --> 00:16:57,478
Most people.

273
00:16:57,613 --> 00:16:59,446
My job in the military was
operating one of these.

274
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,019
Phased Array Radar... PAR.

275
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,116
You know,
scanning for missiles.

276
00:17:05,252 --> 00:17:06,490
Leveled up from Dorothy.

277
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,189
Many levels.

278
00:17:08,325 --> 00:17:09,885
This thing was
so powerful and so fast,

279
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,159
I could watch a moth fly
from, like, a mile away.

280
00:17:13,294 --> 00:17:15,429
But I kept asking myself...

281
00:17:15,564 --> 00:17:18,201
What if we point this thing
at a tornado?

282
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:20,203
Well, Javi,
it's the size of a building.

283
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:21,802
You'd never be able
to get it close enough.

284
00:17:21,937 --> 00:17:23,206
Until now.

285
00:17:24,904 --> 00:17:27,039
The military, they came up
with portable units,

286
00:17:27,174 --> 00:17:28,671
and they're small.

287
00:17:28,807 --> 00:17:30,609
I got my hands
on a few prototypes.

288
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,655
Yo, my man, can...
can I borrow this real quick?

289
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,181
Thanks. Appreciate it.

290
00:17:39,316 --> 00:17:40,454
Um...

291
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,688
All right, look.

292
00:17:43,824 --> 00:17:46,563
Let's say this...
this is a tornado, right?

293
00:17:50,802 --> 00:17:52,000
My team drives up.

294
00:17:52,136 --> 00:17:54,601
We place a portable PAR here.

295
00:17:54,736 --> 00:17:57,141
It's giving me incredible
high-resolution images,

296
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,703
but th... but they're still
kind of flat.

297
00:17:59,569 --> 00:18:01,078
So what do we do?

298
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:04,610
My team sets up two more,
here and here.

299
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:06,717
Now we have a...

300
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,218
A three-dimensional scan.

301
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,947
The most perfect scan
of a tornado ever.

302
00:18:11,082 --> 00:18:14,620
Kate, we can use this data
to save lives back home.

303
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,888
- I mean, this is incredible.
- I know.

304
00:18:20,024 --> 00:18:21,362
And you're the only person
that can get me

305
00:18:21,498 --> 00:18:23,134
close enough to a tornado
to do this.

306
00:18:27,101 --> 00:18:28,768
Javi, I...

307
00:18:28,903 --> 00:18:31,006
- No, I...
I don't chase anymore.
- Come on, Kate.

308
00:18:31,142 --> 00:18:32,736
What have you been doing here?

309
00:18:32,871 --> 00:18:34,609
Uh, sitting behind
a computer screen?

310
00:18:34,745 --> 00:18:36,147
Like...

311
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,115
The girl I know,
she'd be going into the storms

312
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:39,478
while everyone else
was running away.

313
00:18:39,614 --> 00:18:41,310
Well, I'm not
that person anymore.

314
00:18:41,445 --> 00:18:42,846
You have a gift.

315
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,521
Look, I... I can't do this
without you.

316
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,390
Look, I... I...
should really be getting back.

317
00:18:55,525 --> 00:18:56,596
But, um...

318
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:58,994
it was good seeing you.

319
00:19:01,501 --> 00:19:02,437
You be careful out there?

320
00:19:08,945 --> 00:19:09,774
Kate.

321
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,008
You ever wonder...

322
00:19:14,782 --> 00:19:16,484
why it was us
that made it out of there?

323
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,305
<i>It's gonna be okay.</i>

324
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:37,308
<i>- It's gonna be okay.</i>

325
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:39,534
<i>It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.</i>

326
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,373
It's gonna be okay.

327
00:19:41,508 --> 00:19:42,980
- I got you.

328
00:20:10,338 --> 00:20:11,970
<i>Hey, Kate.</i>

329
00:20:12,105 --> 00:20:14,640
<i>Another town got hit last night
with no warning.</i>

330
00:20:14,776 --> 00:20:16,013
<i>We're having
a once-in-a-generation</i>

331
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,547
<i>tornado outbreak in Oklahoma.</i>

332
00:20:18,682 --> 00:20:20,378
<i>It's coming after
the people we love.</i>

333
00:20:20,514 --> 00:20:21,879
<i>It's getting worse every year,</i>

334
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:24,354
<i>but now we have a way
to fight back.</i>

335
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,549
<i>Just give me one week
out here, Kate.</i>

336
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,523
<i>I got a good team,
but the only thing
that's missing is you.</i>

337
00:20:29,455 --> 00:20:30,360
<i>Call me back.</i>

338
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:55,051
<i>♪ I left my boots
Out by the door ♪</i>

339
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,687
<i>♪ Like I always do ♪</i>

340
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:01,690
<i>♪ Same stack of magazines
By the kitchen sink ♪</i>

341
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:04,284
<i>♪ It's nothing new
I packed my bags... ♪</i>

342
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,989
I'm not gonna lie.
I didn't think you'd come.

343
00:21:08,191 --> 00:21:10,268
Nice upgrade
from the old van, right?

344
00:21:12,195 --> 00:21:14,068
Yeah, how are you paying
for all this?

345
00:21:14,204 --> 00:21:15,634
Got investors, you know.

346
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,098
Storms are getting
more erratic,

347
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,772
lot of new housing developments
going up,

348
00:21:18,907 --> 00:21:21,178
so the developers, they want
full-time weather data.

349
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:22,773
So, anytime
a new building goes up,

350
00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:24,648
I want a StormPAR radar
right there

351
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,316
letting the people know
exactly what the storm's
gonna do.

352
00:21:27,451 --> 00:21:28,746
I'm telling you,
I really feel like

353
00:21:28,881 --> 00:21:29,980
we're gonna change

453
00:27:05,384 --> 00:27:07,623
Well, you're a long way

454
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,253
So you like working

455
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:14,588
Tyler, do we know which storm
we're going after yet?

456
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:17,459
Well, why don't we ask...

457

Kate.

458
00:27:19,998 --> 00:27:22,332
Hi, Kate. I'm Tyler.

459
00:27:23,736 --> 00:27:25,436
And I'm Ben.

460
00:27:25,572 --> 00:27:28,512
I'm a reporter, doing a piece
on American storm chasing.

461
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,570
- Yeah.
- Tyler's letting me ride along.

462
00:27:30,706 --> 00:27:32,277
Yeah, Ben just had
to promise to write

463
00:27:32,413 --> 00:27:33,711
- nothing but good stuff
about me.

464
00:27:33,847 --> 00:27:35,015
Good luck with that.

465
00:27:35,912 --> 00:27:37,621
Hang on.

466
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:40,351
You didn't say which way
we were going yet.

467
00:27:40,486 --> 00:27:45,487
Now, from what I gather,
west, we double our chances.

468
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:49,700
East, well, it's high risk,
high reward.

469
00:27:50,666 --> 00:27:52,460
Well, go for the reward.

470
00:27:52,596 --> 00:27:54,068
You don't want Ben to think
you're boring.

471
00:27:54,203 --> 00:27:56,036
No, boring is not usually
a problem for me, Kate.

472
00:27:58,144 --> 00:28:00,707
The two cells to the west are
fighting over the same inflow.

473
00:28:00,843 --> 00:28:02,703
They'll choke each other out.

474
00:28:02,838 --> 00:28:05,045
This one to the east
has the sky all to herself.

475
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,843
Moisture, wind shear,

476
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,083
instability.

477
00:28:10,219 --> 00:28:12,217
All the things you need
to give Ben a good show.

478
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,452
City girl knows
her stuff, Ben.

479
00:28:18,093 --> 00:28:20,157
I said, city girl knows
her stuff, Ben.

480
00:28:20,293 --> 00:28:22,225
Thanks. Maybe if
I work real hard,

481
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,932
I could be
a Tornado Wrangler, too.

482
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,901
Talk to us.

483
00:28:30,037 --> 00:28:31,500
We want the cells to the west.

484
00:28:31,636 --> 00:28:34,005
Uh, the one to the east
has much better numbers.

485
00:28:34,141 --> 00:28:35,404
Mm, conditions
don't feel right.

486
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:36,905
Cap is too strong.
It'll never break.

487
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:38,078
You heard her.

488
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:39,948
Let's move.

489
00:28:41,147 --> 00:28:42,211
All right, let's move, fellas.

490
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,381
- All right.

491
00:28:44,516 --> 00:28:46,856
Guess we're listening
to dandelions now.

492
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,194
I thought she told us east.

493
00:28:56,094 --> 00:28:57,196
She going the wrong way?

494
00:28:58,302 --> 00:28:59,330
Nope.

495
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,914
What did the tornado cowboy
have to say?

496
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,679
Exactly what you'd expect.

497
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:21,825
Oh, updraft is cycling.

498
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:24,954
Okay, let's take a right
up here.

499
00:29:36,072 --> 00:29:37,907
It's forming

500
00:29:42,112 --> 00:29:44,975

Wizard, stick with me.

502
00:29:49,684 --> 00:29:51,152
What's the plan?

503
00:29:51,287 --> 00:29:53,350
So, we want a 3D scan
of the entire area

504
00:29:53,486 --> 00:29:54,986
around the vortex,
which means we're gonna

505
00:29:55,122 --> 00:29:56,626
surround it with three radars,

506
00:29:56,762 --> 00:29:58,657
each one pointed
at the tornado.

507
00:29:58,792 --> 00:30:00,293
Tin Man will get

508
00:30:00,428 --> 00:30:01,288
<i>behind the tornado
and plant his radar</i>

509
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:02,558
<i>on the right-hand side.</i>

510
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,997
Scarecrow is gonna
get behind the tornado

511
00:30:06,133 --> 00:30:08,304
<i>and plant his on the left.</i>

512
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:11,508
<i>And all the data that they send
will be received by Wizard.</i>

513
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:13,140
<i>And how about Lion?</i>

514
00:30:15,738 --> 00:30:17,939
We got to
complete the triangle.

515
00:30:18,075 --> 00:30:20,950
We get right in front of
that thing and set up
our radar.

516
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:25,153
You got this, Kate.

517
00:30:25,288 --> 00:30:27,290
Just tell us where the front
of the tornado is.

518
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:28,887

701
00:41:36,657 --> 00:41:38,350
It's a temperature inversion

00:41:44,027 --> 00:41:45,735
Where did you guys all meet?

706
00:41:45,871 --> 00:41:48,833
Did you, uh... did you study
meteorology at the U of A?

707
00:41:48,968 --> 00:41:50,932
No. No.

708
00:41:51,067 --> 00:41:52,332
All right, Kate, me?

709
00:41:52,467 --> 00:41:53,373
You know,
I just flow with the wind.

710
00:41:53,509 --> 00:41:55,140
You know what I'm saying?

711
00:41:55,275 --> 00:41:57,207
Yeah, I... I never went to,
like, school or nothing.

712
00:41:57,342 --> 00:41:59,648
Um, Tyler, he... he studied
meteorology, though.

713
00:42:00,747 --> 00:42:02,278
- Him?
Yeah.

714
00:42:02,413 --> 00:42:04,050
You know,
he's a cowboy scientist,
you know.

715
00:42:04,186 --> 00:42:05,754
- He's got
this natural instinct.
- Okay, Boone.

716
00:42:05,889 --> 00:42:08,691
- He taught me
everything I know, so--
- Boone.

717
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,650
You know, our crew's
not like your crew, Kate.

718
00:42:10,786 --> 00:42:13,589
We don't need PhDs
and fancy gadgets
to do what we do.

719
00:42:13,724 --> 00:42:15,057
I guarantee you,

720
00:42:15,193 --> 00:42:17,159
these guys have seen
more tornadoes

721
00:42:17,295 --> 00:42:19,435
than anyone else
in this lot combined.

722
00:42:19,571 --> 00:42:20,866
- Is that right?
Do you think

723
00:42:21,001 --> 00:42:22,129
there's a chance
we'll see one tomorrow?

724
00:42:22,265 --> 00:42:23,898
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

725
00:42:24,033 --> 00:42:25,831
Outbreak, baby.

726
00:42:25,967 --> 00:42:28,704
You know, if you can keep up,
we'll put you in the episode.

727
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,305
Wow.

728
00:42:31,845 --> 00:42:33,541
Where are you chasing tomorrow?

729
00:42:33,677 --> 00:42:35,580
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Not falling for that again.

730
00:42:35,715 --> 00:42:37,616
Kate's from New York.

731
00:42:37,752 --> 00:42:39,613
Can't trust a thing she says.

732
00:42:39,749 --> 00:42:43,048
Well, can always trust a guy
who puts his face on a T-shirt.

733
00:42:44,827 --> 00:42:47,454
Man.
Man, that was good.

734
00:42:47,589 --> 00:42:49,091
- Oh, my God, look at his face.

735
00:42:49,226 --> 00:42:50,424
That was spicy,
wasn't it?

736
00:42:52,834 --> 00:42:54,193
You got to
see this, guys!

737
00:42:54,328 --> 00:42:55,435
Y'all got to see this!

738
00:42:56,801 --> 00:42:58,001
<i>Let's go!</i>

739
00:43:04,211 --> 00:43:07,407
<i>This is a 4WARN weather alert.</i>

740
00:43:07,542 --> 00:43:09,247
<i>All right, Oklahoma,</i>

741
00:43:09,383 --> 00:43:10,985
<i>we could be looking at
a record number of tornadoes.</i>

742
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,446
<i>We've been talking about this
for days now.</i>

743
00:43:13,581 --> 00:43:15,153
<i>We'll need to stay
weather-aware</i>

744
00:43:15,289 --> 00:43:17,721
<i>with possible major storms
across Oklahoma</i>

745
00:43:17,857 --> 00:43:19,421
<i>over the next 36 hours.</i>

746
00:43:19,557 --> 00:43:22,632
These are the properties
that were wiped out yesterday.

747
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:24,601
And all the information
we can pull on them.

748
00:43:27,368 --> 00:43:28,198
Hmm.

749
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:30,462
How about the owners?

750
00:43:30,598 --> 00:43:32,308
Most of the properties
are underinsured

751
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,475
or have no insurance at all.

752
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:35,711
Uh, we did talk to a few people

753
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:38,408
who are very interested
in an all-cash offer.

754
00:43:38,544 --> 00:43:39,579
Mm-hmm.

755
00:43:39,715 --> 00:43:41,848
When do you want to head out?

756
00:43:41,983 --> 00:43:43,748
Kate, this is...
this is Marshall Riggs.

757
00:43:43,883 --> 00:43:45,481
We've been working together.

758
00:43:45,616 --> 00:43:46,918
He's one of the StormPAR
investors I told you about.

759
00:43:47,054 --> 00:43:49,087
How scary was
that tornado yesterday?

760
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:53,356
- Not at all.

761
00:43:53,491 --> 00:43:55,762
Listen,
can you give us
a couple minutes?

762
00:43:55,898 --> 00:43:57,596
Maybe grab something
to eat or...

763
00:43:57,732 --> 00:43:58,734
And then we can head out.

764
00:44:05,975 --> 00:44:08,573
Well, boys,
when's the next one?

765
00:44:18,482 --> 00:44:20,486
Well, nothing's
coming out of that one.

766
00:44:20,621 --> 00:44:23,386
That one? No, no.

767
00:44:23,522 --> 00:44:25,761
No, it's clearly moving into
a stable environment.

768
00:44:28,795 --> 00:44:30,930
Yeah. No low-level CAPE.

769
00:44:31,065 --> 00:44:32,759
Not enough shear
to keep it interesting.

770
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:35,166
- Yeah, it's gonna die out.
- Not enough moisture to grow.

771
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:42,206
Where'd you say you learned
how to track storms again?

772
00:44:43,214 --> 00:44:44,208
I didn't.

773
00:44:46,675 --> 00:44:47,878
You know, we're gonna be
stuck here all day

774
00:44:48,014 --> 00:44:49,880
waiting for nothing to happen.

775
00:44:50,016 --> 00:44:51,583
How about we try to get along?

776
00:44:51,719 --> 00:44:53,517
Yeah, you're right.

777
00:44:53,652 --> 00:44:56,456
Tell you what,
I'll... I'll get us
a couple of drinks.

778
00:44:56,592 --> 00:44:57,485
What would you like?

779
00:44:59,097 --> 00:44:59,960
Really?

780
00:45:01,022 --> 00:45:02,463
Really.

781
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,192
Wouldn't mind an iced tea.

782
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:06,065
- Thank you.
- Coming up.

Let's keep helping
each other out.

787
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:24,910
We'll be in touch,
all right?
- We got to go.

788
00:45:25,046 --> 00:45:26,718
Oh.

789
00:45:26,853 --> 00:45:29,222
All right. Um, look...

790
00:45:29,357 --> 00:45:31,691
- We're almost done here.
- Now. We got something big.

791
00:45:31,826 --> 00:45:32,991
The moisture's hung up here,

792
00:45:33,126 --> 00:45:34,653
so that's where
we want to focus.

793
00:45:34,789 --> 00:45:36,929
Pack up the burritos.
We got a winner.

794
00:45:37,065 --> 00:45:38,526
Lily, get your drone
in the air.

795
00:45:38,661 --> 00:45:40,496
We need your video stream.
Ride with us.

796
00:45:40,631 --> 00:45:43,102
- Northwest, ten o'clock?
- That's the one. Let's ride.

00:45:43,237 --> 00:45:44,774
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

798
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:48,239
Showtime, baby.

799
00:45:49,609 --> 00:45:51,310
Clear!

800
00:45:51,446 --> 00:45:53,948
All right,

801
00:45:57,615 --> 00:45:59,617

Ah. Kate must have seen
the storm, too.

811
00:46:40,093 --> 00:46:41,897
They just passed
Dexter and Dani.

812
00:46:43,227 --> 00:46:45,361
So what's the deal with her?

813
00:46:45,496 --> 00:46:47,835
Why don't we focus
on our story, Ben?

814
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:51,005
Sorry. She's just...
intriguing.

815
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,041
What do you see?

816
00:46:55,177 --> 00:46:57,012
Okay, already has
a nice structure.

817
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,343
Moisture levels are just right
and lots of CAPE.

818
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:01,642
What else are you seeing?

819
00:47:02,949 --> 00:47:04,481
Flow is clean.

820
00:47:04,616 --> 00:47:06,482
Pulling tons of warm,
moist air from the south.

821
00:47:06,617 --> 00:47:07,984
And when that warm air
and moisture

822
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:09,651
busts through the cap,

823
00:47:09,786 --> 00:47:11,492
it explodes in the atmosphere,
creating an anvil.

824
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:13,193
The vertical wind shear

825
00:47:13,328 --> 00:47:16,123
begins to rotate the updraft,
forming a mesocyclone.

826
00:47:16,259 --> 00:47:17,733
Here's the mystery.

827
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:19,735
We don't know
how a tornado forms.

828
00:47:19,871 --> 00:47:21,729
We see the hook
on the radar, but...

829
00:47:21,864 --> 00:47:23,972
What are all the invisible
factors coming together?

830
00:47:25,334 --> 00:47:26,733
Every little detail that

831
00:47:26,868 --> 00:47:27,873
- has to be perfect.
- ...has to be perfect.

832
00:47:28,009 --> 00:47:29,668
And it's a mix of what we know

833
00:47:29,804 --> 00:47:31,241
and everything
we can't understand.

834
00:47:31,377 --> 00:47:33,542
It's part science,
part religion.

835
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:39,385
Come on, baby. Come on.

836
00:47:39,521 --> 00:47:41,021
- Please.
Please, please, please.
- Come on. Come on.

837
00:47:41,156 --> 00:47:42,023
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

838
00:47:43,691 --> 00:47:44,792
There it is.

839
00:47:44,927 --> 00:47:47,290
- Yeah, baby!

840
00:47:47,425 --> 00:47:49,091
- There we go, Ben!

841
00:47:49,226 --> 00:47:50,392
- Hey! See that?
- Yeah.

842
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:52,033
That's a tornado
right there, baby.

843
00:47:52,168 --> 00:47:53,595
- Get some photos of that, Ben.

844
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:55,399
The birth of a tornado,
nature's masterpiece.

845
00:48:04,511 --> 00:48:06,042
Please tell me you guys are
seeing this right now.

846
00:48:06,178 --> 00:48:07,642
- Oh!

847
00:48:07,777 --> 00:48:09,709
- We got twins! Twins!
We have twins.

848
00:48:09,844 --> 00:48:11,212
Oh, my goodness.

849
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:12,712
Is... is that normal?

850
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,885
They're rotating.

851
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:16,686
Wait,
there's a name for that.
There's a name. There's a name.

852
00:48:16,822 --> 00:48:17,757
- Shh. Just, hey, just watch it.
- There's a name for that.

853
00:48:17,893 --> 00:48:19,561
Just enjoy it, man.

854
00:48:19,697 --> 00:48:20,893
Fujiwhara Effect!

855
00:48:21,028 --> 00:48:24,525
Fujiwhara Effect!

856
00:48:24,661 --> 00:48:26,226
Oh,
they're pulling apart.

857
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:27,127
One's gonna die out.

858
00:48:27,262 --> 00:48:28,432
Go faster.

859
00:48:34,709 --> 00:48:35,604
You ready?

860
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:38,706
Let's get our data.

861
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,129
Come on, Javi.

862
00:48:57,027 --> 00:48:58,958
Oh, they got they fancy little
trucks there, don't they?

863
00:48:59,094 --> 00:49:00,836
- Come on, faster! Faster!
- You guys ready to rock?

864
00:49:00,972 --> 00:49:02,337
Let's go!

865
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:03,472
Whoa!

866
00:49:05,767 --> 00:49:07,772
- Come on!

867
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:10,911
Go for it. Get around him.

868
00:49:11,046 --> 00:49:12,210
Get on his left.
Get on his left.

869
00:49:12,345 --> 00:49:14,107
- I'm trying.
- Well, try harder.

870
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:15,777
- To the right!
Come on, come on.
- No, I'm not doing that.

871
00:49:15,912 --> 00:49:18,052
Oh, we got a little
bob and weave going on here.

872
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:19,582
- Come on, now.
- Nope, nope, nope.

873
00:49:19,717 --> 00:49:21,447
All right, guys,
let's stop playing games.

874
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:22,589
Let's cut these guys off.

875
00:49:27,897 --> 00:49:29,421
- Come on!

876
00:49:29,557 --> 00:49:30,758
I told you. I told you.

877
00:49:33,334 --> 00:49:34,828
- Eyes on the road.

878
00:49:43,373 --> 00:49:44,475
There you go, Owens.

879
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:51,516
All right,
which one's gonna stay?

880
00:49:51,651 --> 00:49:53,153
- Which one's it gonna be, Kate?
- Okay, I'm on it.

881
00:49:53,289 --> 00:49:54,549
All right, Tyler,
we got to make a choice.

882
00:49:54,684 --> 00:49:56,123
Which one are we going,
left or right?

883
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:57,891
All right, y'all,
we got Tyler Owens here

884
00:49:58,027 --> 00:49:59,559
making a high-pressure choice.

885
00:49:59,694 --> 00:50:01,128
Boone.

886
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:02,863
Stop filming for a second?
I need to think.

887
00:50:02,998 --> 00:50:04,661
Yeah, no, of course.

888
00:50:04,796 --> 00:50:06,327
Hey, Tyler doesn't want you
to see this, all right?

889
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:07,531
He's... he's thinking.

890
00:50:09,733 --> 00:50:11,638
All right, Lily,
what are you seeing?

891
00:50:11,774 --> 00:50:13,333
Uh, it's looking like
the inflow is cranking
on the right.

892
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:14,801
Let's go for the right.

893
00:50:14,937 --> 00:50:16,307
Uh, there should be
a road coming up.

894
00:50:16,442 --> 00:50:17,779
All right,
we're taking the right.

895
00:50:17,915 --> 00:50:19,272
All right, right, guys, right.

896
00:50:19,408 --> 00:50:20,974
Why the right?

897
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:23,383
Well, it's got a strong inflow
of warm, moist air.

898
00:50:23,518 --> 00:50:25,384
Tornado won't have to work
as hard, Benny.

899
00:50:38,659 --> 00:50:39,666
- Go left!
- What?

900
00:50:39,801 --> 00:50:41,202
Take a left!

901
00:50:43,633 --> 00:50:45,373
Going left. Go left, go left.

902
00:50:45,508 --> 00:50:47,835
Javi, you sure?
The right one's got
better numbers.

903
00:50:51,344 --> 00:50:53,182
That's a bad move, honey buns!

904
00:50:53,317 --> 00:50:55,381
Who the hell is making
decisions up there, him or her?

905
00:51:02,183 --> 00:51:04,456
Your intriguing girl
just screwed the pooch, Ben.

906
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:14,530
- All right,
get us set up, Boone.
Yes, sir.

907
00:51:14,665 --> 00:51:16,202
- Gonna fire a couple flares
straight up this thing's ass.
Will do.

908
00:51:16,338 --> 00:51:18,669
All right,
drone's on the ground.

909
00:51:18,804 --> 00:51:20,835
Hang on. What are you--
Hey, Ben.

910
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:22,775
Excuse me. Uh...
How are you?

911
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:24,442
- What are you doing?
Lily,
I need you up here.

912
00:51:24,578 --> 00:51:26,047
Sorry.
These are my new trousers.

913
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:27,444
Can you get
my foot, mate?

914
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,108
Sorry, Ben.
- It's okay.

915
00:51:29,243 --> 00:51:30,647
All right,
how we doing back there, Boone?

916
00:51:30,782 --> 00:51:32,154
Good.
- Hundred yards to intersect.

917
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:34,116
- Dexter, hang back.

God, do we have to drive
into it again?

921
00:51:40,129 --> 00:51:42,359
Nah, Ben. It's driving into us.

What's going on?

935
00:52:13,722 --> 00:52:15,730

Hey.

956
00:53:25,497 --> 00:53:26,961
We should've went with her.

957
00:53:27,096 --> 00:53:28,700
Whoo, baby, let's go!

958
00:53:28,835 --> 00:53:30,736
That was amazing, Kate.
How did you even know that?

959
00:53:30,872 --> 00:53:32,731
Well, did you see the wheat?
Winds moved to the north.

960
00:53:32,867 --> 00:53:34,005
Just what this one needed.

961
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:40,079

00:53:40,215 --> 00:53:42,746

00:54:03,668 --> 00:54:05,538
We're all set! Kate, come on!

964
00:54:09,574 --> 00:54:10,741
All PARs are active, Javi.

965
00:54:25,758 --> 00:54:27,019
Javi,
it's turning, fast!

966
00:54:27,155 --> 00:54:30,257
How we looking?
Wizard, talk to me!

967
00:54:30,393 --> 00:54:32,829
We lost your radar, Javi.
You got eyes on the tornado?

968
00:54:52,857 --> 00:54:54,089
What was that?

969
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:55,456
I think I killed some chickens.

970
00:55:14,405 --> 00:55:15,806
Come on!

971
00:55:43,702 --> 00:55:45,132
Thank God, it just grazed us.

972
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,306
<i>Javi?</i>

973
00:55:53,441 --> 00:55:55,343
<i>- Javi, you hear me?</i>
- Yeah, I can hear you.

974
00:55:55,478 --> 00:55:57,175
<i>All right, we got
two radars looking good.</i>

975
00:55:57,311 --> 00:55:58,649
Third one was getting
great data.

976
00:55:58,785 --> 00:56:01,787
We just need to find it,
download it all.

977
00:56:01,922 --> 00:56:05,660
Javi, the... the tornado
is headed to a small town.

978
00:56:05,796 --> 00:56:07,590
They already called it in.
There's nothing we can do now.

979
00:56:07,725 --> 00:56:09,023
But someone might need help.

980
00:56:09,158 --> 00:56:10,529
There's a GPS tracker
on the radar.

981
00:56:10,664 --> 00:56:11,999
We need to find it
before it dies.

982
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:13,699
Javi, we've got to help.

983
00:56:31,783 --> 00:56:33,180
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we're imposing a curfew</i>

984
00:56:33,315 --> 00:56:35,522
<i>for the safety
of everyone in the area.</i>

985
00:56:35,657 --> 00:56:37,426
<i>Unless you're
a safety official,</i>

986
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:39,593
<i>please clear the area
till 5:00 a.m.</i>

987
00:56:42,425 --> 00:56:44,466
Yeah, let us know if you need
anything, all right?

988
00:56:45,664 --> 00:56:47,202
You were right back there.

989
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:48,767
It's good that we came to help.

990
00:56:50,538 --> 00:56:51,902
I wish we could do more.

991
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:56,243
Javi, can the data
from the PAR radar

992
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:57,946
show us how the tornado died?

993
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,508
Yeah. Why?

994
00:56:59,644 --> 00:57:02,011
I don't know.

995
00:57:02,146 --> 00:57:03,782
Maybe we could use it
to prevent all this.

996
00:57:05,683 --> 00:57:07,016
There's the Kate I know.

997
00:57:10,919 --> 00:57:12,918
Hey, look, um, here.

998
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:14,386
Take the truck, all right?

999
00:57:15,764 --> 00:57:17,499
I'll go deal with
locating the radar.

1000
00:57:18,265 --> 00:57:19,325
You should rest.

1001
00:57:20,302 --> 00:57:21,635
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1002
00:57:25,899 --> 00:57:27,265
Come on, buddy.

1003
00:57:32,747 --> 00:57:34,241
You got that
in a medium?

1004
00:57:37,113 --> 00:57:39,751
Was a nice play
on the left twin.

1005
00:57:39,887 --> 00:57:43,118
Yeah, well, didn't help
these people any.

1006
00:57:43,254 --> 00:57:45,283
Oh, this is, uh...
this is my Uncle Marshall.

1007
00:57:45,419 --> 00:57:47,252
This is the, uh, owner
of the bar here.

1008
00:57:47,387 --> 00:57:48,760
- How you doing?
- You're the owner?

1009
00:57:48,896 --> 00:57:50,795
- Yes, sir.
- Well, I'm sorry what happened.

1010
00:57:50,931 --> 00:57:52,525
We're gonna make it right.
Here's my card.

1011
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:55,232
Didn't know StormPAR was
in the business of helping.

1012
00:57:55,367 --> 00:57:57,572
Well, from what I see, they're
trying to make a difference.

1013
00:57:58,771 --> 00:57:59,841
That's one way of putting it.

1014
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:01,169
What?

1015
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:05,608
Do you even know
who you're chasing for?

1016
00:58:05,744 --> 00:58:07,912
- What are you talking about?
- How much more do these people
got to lose

1017
00:58:08,047 --> 00:58:10,111
before y'all are done
making a difference?

1018
00:58:10,246 --> 00:58:12,214
Sorry, says the guy
setting up shop,

1019
00:58:12,349 --> 00:58:15,117
selling T-shirts and mugs
after a storm's hit.

1020
00:58:15,252 --> 00:58:17,350
Tyler, you have a minute
for some questions?

1021
00:58:17,485 --> 00:58:19,790
Yeah, I got a dog to find.
Talk to Kate.

1022
00:58:19,926 --> 00:58:21,226
She seems to have
all the answers.

1023
00:58:21,361 --> 00:58:22,956
Hey, Boone?

1024
00:58:23,091 --> 00:58:24,698
Now's not a good time, Ben.

1025
00:58:29,504 --> 00:58:32,541
Kate. Here, take some food.

1026
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:34,609
- Oh, don't have any cash.
- Nah, it's free.

1027
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:36,171
That's why we're always selling
those T-shirts.

1028
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:39,209
- Got some free food.
- Thank you.

1029
00:58:39,344 --> 00:58:41,207
Free water. Make sure
you stay hydrated, all right?

1030
00:58:41,342 --> 00:58:43,011
Appreciate y'all.
- Oh.

1031
00:58:43,147 --> 00:58:46,146
Well, save it.
In case you run low.

1032
00:58:46,282 --> 00:58:48,585
Okay. Well, at least
take some water.

1033
00:58:48,721 --> 00:58:49,987
- Thanks.
- Yeah. See ya.

1034
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:58,457
It just took everything.

1044
00:59:30,323 --> 00:59:31,567
Thought you might be hungry.

1045
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,147
You find the dog?

1046
00:59:56,283 --> 00:59:57,384
Of course I found the dog.

1047
00:59:59,287 --> 01:00:00,453
How you doing after all that?

1048
01:00:02,399 --> 01:00:03,924
I mean, it doesn't matter.

1049
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:05,458
It's those people that...

1050
01:00:07,596 --> 01:00:10,232
Yeah, well, you've seen
the worst of this place.

1051
01:00:12,602 --> 01:00:15,105
Thought it'd be nice
for you to see something good.

1052
01:00:16,875 --> 01:00:18,839
Want to take you somewhere.

1053
01:00:18,975 --> 01:00:20,110
Think it might help.

1054
01:00:23,251 --> 01:00:24,147
Come on.

Picking him up

1060
01:00:44,737 --> 01:00:46,598
Can we get two legs?

1061
01:00:46,733 --> 01:00:49,536
Oh, he slipped a leg.
That'll be a plus five.

1062
01:00:49,671 --> 01:00:52,637
The best part is, Stillwater,
they are one of yours.

1063
01:00:52,772 --> 01:00:54,815
So send them out
with just a little bit...

1064
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:56,652
You ever see anything
like this, city girl?

1065
01:00:59,456 --> 01:01:00,656
You keep calling me that.

1066
01:01:02,119 --> 01:01:04,526
You know I grew up on a farm?

1067
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,454
Yeah. Sapulpa.
Couple hours from here.

1068
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:10,523
This ain't my first rodeo.

1069
01:01:10,659 --> 01:01:13,592
Look at that.
I learned something about you.

1070
01:01:20,872 --> 01:01:22,806
So tell me this.

1071
01:01:22,941 --> 01:01:24,570
What was your first tornado?

1072
01:01:25,315 --> 01:01:26,741
Tell me yours.

1073
01:01:26,876 --> 01:01:28,046
I was eight.

1074
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:30,719
Driving with my aunt.

1075
01:01:31,816 --> 01:01:33,083
Sirens are going.

1076
01:01:33,218 --> 01:01:36,316
All of a sudden,
this vortex just lowers

1077
01:01:36,452 --> 01:01:38,188
right down in the center
of the road.

1078
01:01:39,792 --> 01:01:41,158
I was just mesmerized.

1079
01:01:42,191 --> 01:01:43,622
Then I looked at my aunt,

1080
01:01:43,757 --> 01:01:45,129
and she's got this look
on her face, and...

1081
01:01:47,104 --> 01:01:49,001
I realized in that moment
I was supposed to be scared.

1082
01:01:49,734 --> 01:01:50,596
Were you scared?

1083
01:01:51,867 --> 01:01:52,708
Yeah.

1084
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:56,778
- Yeah, I was.

1085
01:01:56,914 --> 01:01:59,607
Oh, the Tornado Wrangler
is scared of tornadoes.

1086
01:02:01,813 --> 01:02:02,784
Okay, Sapulpa.

1087
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,189
Do you know him?

1088
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:15,863
I used to compete.

1089
01:02:15,999 --> 01:02:19,064
Got my head stomped on
by one too many bulls.

1090
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:20,693
Thought college might be
better for my brain.

1091
01:02:20,828 --> 01:02:24,265
You're scared of tornadoes
but not of riding bulls?

1092
01:02:24,401 --> 01:02:27,101
Well, tornadoes, bulls,
same thing.

1093
01:02:27,236 --> 01:02:29,635
Fear's the reason you do it.

1094
01:02:29,770 --> 01:02:33,276
You don't face your fears,
you ride 'em.

1095

1096
01:02:54,299 --> 01:02:55,661
Were you tracking cells
out this way?

1097
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:04,311
Air feels heavy.
This isn't good.

1098
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:19,421
Ladies and gentlemen,
I just received word

1099
01:03:19,556 --> 01:03:21,324
a tornado has touched down
near the area!

1100
01:03:21,459 --> 01:03:23,093
We need to evacuate
this arena right now!

1101
01:03:23,229 --> 01:03:25,097
Once again,
ladies and gentlemen,

1102
01:03:25,232 --> 01:03:26,828
we need to evacuate
this arena right now!

1103
01:03:29,965 --> 01:03:31,929
Keep moving, Kate. Come on.
Keep moving, keep moving.

1104
01:03:32,065 --> 01:03:33,934
...evacuate
the rodeo grounds immediately!

1105
01:03:34,069 --> 01:03:36,872
- Once again, a tornado
has just touched down...

1106
01:03:46,285 --> 01:03:47,956
Come on, Kate.
All right, you got it.

1107
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:49,950
- I got her. You're all right.
- Come here, come here.

1108
01:03:50,085 --> 01:03:50,749
- You're all right.
You're all right.
- All right, come on.

1109
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,898
- Get inside! Get inside!

1110
01:03:59,034 --> 01:04:01,461
All right, watch out,
watch out.

1111
01:04:01,597 --> 01:04:03,063
Whoa, stop!

1112
01:04:03,199 --> 01:04:04,564
Stop, stop, stop!

1113
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:06,038
All right.
Keep going, keep going.

1114
01:04:06,174 --> 01:04:06,798
Wait, wait, wait!
- Hey, hey, hey!

1115
01:04:08,176 --> 01:04:09,936
Okay, just get in the car,
okay, honey?

1116
01:04:10,071 --> 01:04:11,811
- Hey! Get inside!
Ma'am,
stay out of the car.

1117
01:04:11,946 --> 01:04:13,276
- Come here.
- Come to Mommy.

1118
01:04:13,412 --> 01:04:14,943
Hello. Nothing works
in this shithole.

1119
01:04:15,079 --> 01:04:16,676
Now the cable's out.

1120
01:04:16,812 --> 01:04:18,515
I can't get a soda
from the vending machine.

1121
01:04:18,651 --> 01:04:20,483
- The pool's empty as shit.
- Do you have a storm shelter?

1122
01:04:20,618 --> 01:04:22,217
- Man, the AC's blowing hot air.
No. I'm sorry.

1123
01:04:22,352 --> 01:04:23,549
Can we get a refund going here?

1124
01:04:23,685 --> 01:04:24,491
All right,
maybe like a basement.

1125
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:25,993
Do you have a basement?

1126
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:27,589
No.
- There's a line here, buddy.

1127
01:04:27,724 --> 01:04:28,661
We need to get these people
underground right now.

1128
01:04:28,797 --> 01:04:30,492
Okay, there's no tornado.

1129
01:04:30,627 --> 01:04:32,724
Nine times out of ten,
it's a false alarm.

1130
01:04:41,945 --> 01:04:44,143
- You hear that?
- Now the power's out.

1131
01:04:44,279 --> 01:04:47,374
- No tornado.
- We got to find
a shelter, fast.

1132
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:49,016
Hey!

1133
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:00,052
Hey, I don't want to
have to give you a bad review.

1134
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:02,088
- I just started working here.
- Man, I don't want to have...

1135
01:05:02,224 --> 01:05:03,190
- Everybody, come with me!
- All right, follow her,
follow her.

1136
01:05:03,326 --> 01:05:04,356
All right. Ma'am, come on.

1137
01:05:04,492 --> 01:05:06,101
Come on. Move, move, move.

1138
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:07,093
- Move, move, move.
We got to go.
- Hey. Whoa.

1139
01:05:07,228 --> 01:05:08,129
Hey. What?

1140
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:13,341
There's a tornado!
There's a tornado!

1141
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:16,340
Hey! Let's hop
in the Jeep!

1142
01:05:16,475 --> 01:05:18,213
Keep going!
It's too close!

1143
01:05:18,348 --> 01:05:19,580
Let's go!
Come on! Let's go!
Go, go, go, go!

1144
01:05:19,716 --> 01:05:21,075
Let's go! Come on, get in!

1145
01:05:21,211 --> 01:05:24,579
Go! Ah! Get in the car!

1146
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:29,250
- Go, go, go, go, go!
All right, go, go!

1147
01:05:34,057 --> 01:05:34,989
Come on, honey.

1148
01:05:35,124 --> 01:05:36,589
Watch your step!

1149
01:05:36,725 --> 01:05:38,564
All right,
we got to move faster!

1150
01:05:38,699 --> 01:05:40,259
Keep going!
All right,
you got her?

1151
01:05:42,231 --> 01:05:44,863
No! No! Stop!

1152
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,141
No!

1153
01:05:52,276 --> 01:05:53,775
We got to go! We got to go!

1154
01:05:53,911 --> 01:05:54,950
Go!

1155
01:05:58,916 --> 01:06:00,745
Okay. Okay, hold on.
Come on, honey.

1156
01:06:00,881 --> 01:06:02,117
Okay,
you got to stay low.

1157
01:06:02,253 --> 01:06:03,518
- Cover her eyes.
- Okay.

1158
01:06:03,653 --> 01:06:05,158
- Hold on tight! Hold on tight!
- Okay.

1159
01:06:05,293 --> 01:06:06,657
- Okay, you're gonna be okay.
- Hold on, honey.

1160
01:06:06,792 --> 01:06:07,919
Tyler!

1161
01:06:14,529 --> 01:06:16,261
No, Kate! Stay with them!

1162
01:06:16,396 --> 01:06:17,471
Help me!

1163
01:06:20,941 --> 01:06:22,808
All right. Look at me.

1164
01:06:22,943 --> 01:06:24,140
All right, stay down.

1165
01:06:24,275 --> 01:06:25,745
Just grab my hand. Come on.

1166
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,572
I got you. I got you.

1167
01:06:27,707 --> 01:06:29,678
Don't let it get me! Please!

1168
01:06:29,813 --> 01:06:31,976
Keep your head down.
Just stay low. Eyes on me.

1169
01:06:32,112 --> 01:06:33,812
- I can do it.
- Stay low! No, no, no, no, no!

1170
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:35,555
- No, I can do it.
- No, no! No, no, no!

1171
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:40,362
- Hang on!
- Help me!

1172
01:06:40,497 --> 01:06:41,487
Stay down!

1173
01:06:41,623 --> 01:06:42,892
- Help me!
- No, no, no, no!

1174
01:06:54,435 --> 01:06:55,505
Tyler!

1175
01:07:06,021 --> 01:07:07,478
We're gonna be okay!

1176
01:07:07,614 --> 01:07:09,253
We're going to be okay!

1177
01:07:09,389 --> 01:07:10,992
- I've got you.

1178
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:13,688
It's going to be okay.
I've got you.

1179
01:07:14,654 --> 01:07:15,855
It's going to be okay.

1180
01:07:16,962 --> 01:07:18,066
It's all right.

1181
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:21,803
<i>It's gonna be okay.</i>

1182
01:07:21,938 --> 01:07:24,171
<i>I've got you. I've got you.</i>

1183
01:07:41,218 --> 01:07:42,222
Tyler?

1184
01:07:49,526 --> 01:07:51,198
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1185
01:07:53,966 --> 01:07:54,861
Is it over?

1186
01:08:47,117 --> 01:08:48,288
Kate!

1187
01:08:52,991 --> 01:08:53,953
Kate.

1188
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:02,035
When I saw the size of it
on the radar

1189
01:09:02,170 --> 01:09:03,633
and... and where it was headed,

1190
01:09:03,769 --> 01:09:04,869
- all I could think was...
- I'm... I'm all right.

1191
01:09:05,005 --> 01:09:05,899
I'm all right.

1192
01:09:07,274 --> 01:09:08,770
So where did you stick it out?

1193
01:09:09,877 --> 01:09:11,003
Right down here.

1194
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:13,643
Good call.

1195
01:09:15,378 --> 01:09:16,250
It's all Kate.

1196
01:09:19,717 --> 01:09:21,189
You've been with Owens
the whole time?

1197
01:09:22,087 --> 01:09:23,422
Yeah. Why?

1198
01:09:25,223 --> 01:09:26,656
Javi.

1199
01:09:26,791 --> 01:09:28,327
Apparently, this, uh,
place was family-owned,

1200
01:09:28,463 --> 01:09:29,823
so I'm gonna start
working up some numbers.

1201
01:09:29,959 --> 01:09:31,629
Riggs is gonna want those
first thing.

1202
01:09:31,764 --> 01:09:33,160
Okay, man, I'll...
I'll catch up with you guys.

1203
01:09:33,295 --> 01:09:34,169
Yeah.

1204
01:09:34,934 --> 01:09:36,866
Javi...

1205
01:09:37,002 --> 01:09:40,072
what is Riggs getting out of
all your data collection?

1206
01:09:40,207 --> 01:09:42,538
What's... what's it matter?

1207
01:09:42,674 --> 01:09:44,142
Is profiting
off of people's tragedy

1208
01:09:44,277 --> 01:09:45,378
part of your business plan?

1209
01:09:46,608 --> 01:09:47,677
Why are you doing this?

1210
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:51,083
Wait, hold on.

1211
01:09:51,219 --> 01:09:52,482
Riggs is offering these people

1212
01:09:52,618 --> 01:09:54,013
a way to move on
with their lives.

1213
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:56,517
He's swooping in
and taking advantage of people

1214
01:09:56,653 --> 01:09:59,050
who have just lost everything.

1215
01:09:59,186 --> 01:10:01,196
You... you have no idea
what that's like.

1216
01:10:03,231 --> 01:10:04,595
I don't know what that's like?

1217
01:10:07,303 --> 01:10:09,497
How about losing
three of my best friends

1218
01:10:09,632 --> 01:10:11,965
while you were trying to
land a big, fat grant
for your science project?

1219
01:10:16,844 --> 01:10:17,668
Huh.

1220
01:10:17,804 --> 01:10:19,379
Kate. Kate, I didn't...

1221
01:10:22,652 --> 01:10:23,876
Kate!

1222
01:10:26,317 --> 01:10:27,546
Mm-hmm.

1223
01:10:27,681 --> 01:10:29,247
Kate. Wait, wait.

1224
01:10:29,383 --> 01:10:31,325
- Don't leave like this. Look.

1225
01:10:32,486 --> 01:10:33,821
Kate!

1226
01:10:33,957 --> 01:10:35,989

01:12:15,721 --> 01:12:16,760
Kate?

1251
01:12:18,968 --> 01:12:20,159
What happened?

1252
01:12:20,968 --> 01:12:22,029
What...

1253
01:12:34,078 --> 01:12:37,979
I am sorry
there's so much junk in here.

1254
01:12:39,785 --> 01:12:41,389
I'll clear it out
for you tomorrow.

1255
01:12:43,318 --> 01:12:47,154
And your friend Javi stopped by
a few weeks back.

1256
01:12:47,289 --> 01:12:49,760
Almost didn't recognize him
with the haircut.

1257
01:12:52,001 --> 01:12:53,258
You chasing again?

1258
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:54,831
No.

1259
01:13:07,512 --> 01:13:08,680
Do you need anything?

1260
01:13:09,810 --> 01:13:11,177
No, I'm fine.

1261
01:13:12,151 --> 01:13:13,014
Okay.

1262
01:13:16,391 --> 01:13:18,393
- Good night.
- Good night.

1263
01:13:37,178 --> 01:13:38,413
Here we are.

1264
01:13:39,746 --> 01:13:41,244
Oh, hello!
Hello.

1265
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:42,280
Hello!

1266
01:13:42,416 --> 01:13:44,045
- Ahoy!
Ahoy!

1267
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:46,285
Kate is doing some work,
as always.

1268
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:49,147
Where is she? Show yourself.

1269
01:13:49,283 --> 01:13:51,152
- Isn't she cute?
- What are you doing?

1270
01:13:51,288 --> 01:13:53,391
I'm just doing a little
video tour of the barn,

1271
01:13:53,527 --> 01:13:55,386
where we do most of our work.

1272
01:13:55,522 --> 01:13:59,130
This is Kate's famous
middle school project.

1273
01:13:59,265 --> 01:14:00,928
Whoo-hoo.

1274
01:14:01,063 --> 01:14:02,259
What is it
you're working on, Kate?

1275
01:14:02,395 --> 01:14:05,570
- Tell the folks.
- Uh, cloud microphysics.

1276
01:14:05,705 --> 01:14:07,165
- Say again? Cloud mic--

1277
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:09,006
Cloud microphysics.
- Guys.

1278
01:14:09,142 --> 01:14:10,908
- This is what I have to
put up with...

1279
01:14:11,043 --> 01:14:13,441
...when you're dating someone
who's very bright.

1280
01:14:13,576 --> 01:14:14,510
Gorgeous?

1281
01:14:14,646 --> 01:14:15,976
- Hey, Jeb?
- Yeah?

1282
01:14:16,112 --> 01:14:17,285
- What are we gonna do tomorrow?
- Today?

1283
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:19,382
Uh-uh, tomorrow.
What are we doing?

1284
01:14:19,517 --> 01:14:20,916
We're going chasing...
Uh, we're gonna kill
a tornado, right?

1285
01:14:21,051 --> 01:14:22,588
We're gonna be--
We're taming a tornado.

1286
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:24,918
- We're taming a tornado?
- We're taming it.

1287
01:14:25,053 --> 01:14:27,918
This is Kate's favorite slogan.

1288
01:14:28,054 --> 01:14:29,160
"Taming a tornado."

1289
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:32,892
This is...
this is what it's like

1290
01:14:33,028 --> 01:14:34,325
to be inside a tornado, Kate.

1291
01:14:34,461 --> 01:14:35,932
Well,
I can only do it with you.

1292
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:45,172
How you doing?

1293
01:14:46,908 --> 01:14:49,049
Just the way I left it.

1294
01:14:49,184 --> 01:14:51,842
I've been wondering
what you want me to do
with all this stuff.

1295
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:54,951
You can just throw it out.

1296
01:14:57,126 --> 01:14:59,527
You done? Hmm?

1297
01:15:01,995 --> 01:15:05,232
It's funny, I keep seeing
more and more tornadoes

1298
01:15:05,368 --> 01:15:07,964
and floods and droughts and...

1299
01:15:08,099 --> 01:15:11,539
price of wheat and seed
going up and up and up.

1300
01:15:15,805 --> 01:15:17,006
But I'm still here.

1301
01:15:18,344 --> 01:15:19,679
I'm sorry, Mom.

1302
01:15:23,486 --> 01:15:25,014
I haven't been good
about calling.

1303
01:15:27,785 --> 01:15:30,221
I've got to get this. Um...

1304
01:15:30,356 --> 01:15:32,318
"Throw it away."

1305
01:15:32,454 --> 01:15:34,958
I'm still waiting for you
to save the world.

1306
01:15:57,246 --> 01:15:59,851
Build your own tornado.
Look at that.

1307
01:16:01,855 --> 01:16:03,690
Middle school
science fair project.

1308
01:16:05,690 --> 01:16:07,023
Well, you must've won.

1309
01:16:14,599 --> 01:16:15,599
How'd you find me?

1310
01:16:15,735 --> 01:16:17,297
Uh, Dexter pieced it together.

1311
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,609
He remembered your name
from the news a few years back.

1312
01:16:26,042 --> 01:16:27,538
I'm sorry about your friends.

1313
01:16:30,546 --> 01:16:32,784
I'm fixing some food.
You two okay eating outside?

1314
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:34,521
Oh, I'm not gonna
bother you, Ms. Carter.

1315
01:16:34,657 --> 01:16:36,080
- He's not staying.
- He's staying.

1316
01:16:36,215 --> 01:16:37,525
You can call me Cathy.

1317
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:38,791
Kate, why don't you set up
the table?

1318
01:16:41,928 --> 01:16:43,123
That only
gets you so far,

1319
01:16:43,259 --> 01:16:45,633
and every chaser
has to make a guess,

1320
01:16:45,768 --> 01:16:47,234
and the good ones have
an instinct for it.

1321
01:16:47,370 --> 01:16:49,734
Oh, she had that early on.

1322
01:16:49,870 --> 01:16:51,304
Always knew
when weather was coming,

1323
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:52,971
even better than the cows.

1324
01:16:53,106 --> 01:16:55,169
Wow, you hear that?
You're better than the cows.

1325
01:16:55,305 --> 01:16:57,409
- That's a compliment.

1326
01:16:57,545 --> 01:16:59,309
Got to have a feel for it.

1327
01:16:59,444 --> 01:17:00,946
She always had
a feel for it, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

1328
01:17:01,081 --> 01:17:03,242
One time,
I was giving her a bath--

1329
01:17:03,378 --> 01:17:04,984
- Can we not?
- Maybe just a little.

1330
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:08,519
And we heard thunder,
and she shot up out of the tub

1331
01:17:08,654 --> 01:17:10,419
and ran out the house

1332
01:17:10,554 --> 01:17:12,255
- naked as the day
she was born...
Oh, my God.

1333
01:17:12,391 --> 01:17:13,621
- ...and I had no idea
where she w--

1334
01:17:13,756 --> 01:17:15,090
I was terrified.

1335
01:17:15,226 --> 01:17:17,523
And when I finally
caught up with her,

1336
01:17:17,659 --> 01:17:20,030
she was standing in
the middle of the wheat field,

1337
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:23,001
staring at the sky.

1338
01:17:23,136 --> 01:17:25,234
- I got to try that out.
- Will you stop encouraging her?

1339
01:17:25,369 --> 01:17:27,169
Keep your clothes on, Kate.
Let your mom finish.

1340
01:17:27,305 --> 01:17:29,974
All I'm saying is,
she always loved weather.

1341
01:17:31,572 --> 01:17:33,340
Worse the weather,
the happier the girl.

1342
01:17:36,647 --> 01:17:37,981
What about you?

1343
01:17:38,117 --> 01:17:39,511
Tyler, how'd you come
to do this work?

1344
01:17:42,316 --> 01:17:43,989
Well, when you love something,

1345
01:17:44,124 --> 01:17:45,517
you'll spend your whole life
trying to understand it.

1346
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:49,987
Katie was studying for a PhD.

1347
01:17:50,122 --> 01:17:52,096
Wow.

1348
01:17:52,231 --> 01:17:54,191
I keep telling her
to come back and finish it.

1349
01:17:54,326 --> 01:17:55,869
Okay, Mom.

1350
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:57,503
She was heading up a big study
with her friends:

1351
01:17:57,638 --> 01:18:00,166
disrupting tornado dynamics.

1352
01:18:00,301 --> 01:18:02,301
Uh, does anybody need anything?

1353
01:18:02,437 --> 01:18:05,045
Nah, I'm...
I'm good, thank you.

1354
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:06,307
'Kay.

1355
01:18:08,975 --> 01:18:10,976
<i>Once-in-a-generation

1356
01:18:11,112 --> 01:18:12,411

01:18:19,019 --> 01:18:21,093
<i>- for increasingly
violent tornado--</i>

1361
01:18:21,229 --> 01:18:23,927
I invited Tyler to stay
the night in the guest room.

1362
01:18:24,063 --> 01:18:25,425
Mom.

1363
01:18:34,008 --> 01:18:36,636
You thought
you could disrupt a tornado.

1364
01:18:36,772 --> 01:18:39,645
- Hey, don't look at that.
- Oh, you're the OG Wrangler.

1365
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:40,810
Tyler, can you give that to me?

1366
01:18:40,946 --> 01:18:42,143
"Using superabsorbent polymers

1367
01:18:42,278 --> 01:18:44,049
to reduce moisture
in the updraft,

1368
01:18:44,185 --> 01:18:45,011
- trying to collapse it
like a house of cards."
- Tyler.

1369
01:18:45,146 --> 01:18:46,711
I mean, you'd have to

1370
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:48,580
drop a silo of it in a funnel
for any real effect.

1371
01:18:48,716 --> 01:18:50,052
Well, yeah, that's why
we were trying to use

1372
01:18:50,188 --> 01:18:52,025
different reagents
to enhance it.

1373
01:18:52,161 --> 01:18:53,718
- It's a dumb idea.
- Yeah, some of
your reactants are off.

1374
01:18:53,853 --> 01:18:54,894
- A few of these
solubility rules skew--

1375
01:18:55,626 --> 01:18:57,158
What?

1376
01:18:57,294 --> 01:18:58,256
You really think
I'm an idiot, don't you?

1377
01:18:58,392 --> 01:18:59,932
No, I don't think you're an--

1378
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:01,860
- Hey, modeling's got
so much better.
- Tyler.

1379
01:19:01,995 --> 01:19:03,361
I can upload this to my laptop,
link up with a supercomputer.

1380
01:19:03,497 --> 01:19:05,137
- No, no...
- I'm telling you,

1381
01:19:05,273 --> 01:19:06,697
- we can get
a new model running.
- That's okay.

1382
01:19:06,832 --> 01:19:08,137
- Please, can you stop?
- It's a great idea.

1383
01:19:08,273 --> 01:19:09,067
How did you not tell me
about this before?

1384
01:19:09,203 --> 01:19:09,770
Because I got it wrong!

1385
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:14,307
In the field, in the moment,

1386
01:19:14,442 --> 01:19:17,411
when it mattered,
I got it wrong.

1387
01:19:17,546 --> 01:19:19,319
Okay, I underestimated
what we were up against,

1388
01:19:19,455 --> 01:19:21,078
and I pushed it too far.

1389
01:19:21,214 --> 01:19:22,717
And for what?

1390
01:19:24,622 --> 01:19:26,761
Some childish dream I had
that I could make a difference?

1391
01:19:28,431 --> 01:19:29,720
It was never gonna work.

1392
01:19:32,892 --> 01:19:35,902
And I h... I have to live
with that forever.

1393
01:19:49,710 --> 01:19:55,283
You know, uh, EF1 or EF5
tornado rating...

1394
01:19:55,418 --> 01:19:57,154
it's not based on size
or wind speed.

1395
01:19:58,693 --> 01:20:00,124
The power we ascribe to it,

1396
01:20:01,629 --> 01:20:03,921
it's based on damage.

1397
01:20:04,057 --> 01:20:08,264
Now, it's only after the fact
we can really define it.

1398
01:20:08,399 --> 01:20:11,300
What it destroys,
what it takes from us.

1399
01:20:13,499 --> 01:20:15,172
I'm sorry for what happened.

1400
01:20:17,844 --> 01:20:19,275
But how much more

1401
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:20,947
are you gonna let this thing
take from you?

1402
01:20:29,088 --> 01:20:30,182
You know, you should...

1403
01:20:30,318 --> 01:20:31,782
you should get some sleep.

1404
01:20:33,556 --> 01:20:34,961
Don't want to miss
any storms tomorrow.

1405
01:22:14,723 --> 01:22:16,326
You said you could get
a new model running?

1406
01:22:19,259 --> 01:22:20,429
Yes, ma'am.

1407
01:22:23,204 --> 01:22:26,631
So this is an EF1,
perfect conditions.

1408
01:22:26,767 --> 01:22:29,503
Run your experiment,
see if it works.

1409
01:22:29,638 --> 01:22:33,076
Okay, so, um,
1,500 kilos of polymer

1410
01:22:33,211 --> 01:22:35,575
absorbing 300 times its weight.

1411
01:22:35,710 --> 01:22:38,877
So, it's, uh,
450,000 kilos

1412
01:22:39,012 --> 01:22:42,148
of precipitation loaded into
our water-filled polymer

1413
01:22:42,284 --> 01:22:43,982
to load the updraft.

1414
01:22:44,118 --> 01:22:45,752
- Let's see
how the model responds.

1415
01:22:45,887 --> 01:22:47,660
Buoyancy of
the rising air is reducing.

1416
01:22:47,795 --> 01:22:49,920
It's reducing.

1417
01:22:50,055 --> 01:22:51,460
- Slowing the updraft.
- Temp is going down.

1418
01:22:52,535 --> 01:22:53,396
Kate?

1419
01:22:55,268 --> 01:22:57,070
Kate, in theory,
this should've worked.

1420
01:22:59,772 --> 01:23:00,766
In theory.

1421
01:23:03,406 --> 01:23:04,801
But it wasn't an EF1 that day.

1422
01:23:04,937 --> 01:23:07,509
I mean...
we never had a chance.

1423
01:23:09,684 --> 01:23:10,644
You want one?

1424
01:23:22,662 --> 01:23:24,362
Yeah, that's my radio.
What's all this for?

1425
01:23:24,497 --> 01:23:26,360
Wait, what are you touching
back there? Stop.

1426
01:23:26,496 --> 01:23:28,064
You have
a lot of stuff in here.

1427
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,201
Yeah, that... that's a mirror.

1428
01:23:30,769 --> 01:23:32,469
Oh, God.

1429
01:23:32,605 --> 01:23:34,735
- Ooh.
- Have you ever been
in a car before?

1430
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:36,901
- You got a lot of gadgets.
- Yeah, yeah, don't touch.

1431
01:23:37,036 --> 01:23:38,274
There's... there's guards there
for a reason.

1432
01:23:38,409 --> 01:23:39,636
- What do these do?
- That's a...

1433
01:23:39,772 --> 01:23:41,506
- Oh! God.

1434
01:23:41,642 --> 01:23:42,513
- Sorry.
- That's a rocket.

1435
01:23:42,649 --> 01:23:44,217
Yep.

1436
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:45,475
All right, what about
these two little ones?

1437
01:23:45,610 --> 01:23:47,354
Just west of Enid.

1438
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:49,980
Yeah, but this one to the east
has the sky all to herself.

1439
01:23:51,522 --> 01:23:52,950
Yeah, I'm not falling
for that again.

1440
01:23:56,829 --> 01:23:57,691

1441
01:23:58,765 --> 01:24:00,562

01:25:18,444 --> 01:25:20,147

01:25:28,148 --> 01:25:29,352

So many belts.

1491
01:26:47,836 --> 01:26:48,895

that's the problem?

How do we create a better one?

1495
01:27:24,872 --> 01:27:26,968
Hey, uh...

1496
01:27:27,103 --> 01:27:29,203
about what I said earlier,
I didn't mean any of that.

1497
01:27:29,338 --> 01:27:31,071
It's fine.

1498
01:27:31,207 --> 01:27:33,610
If there's anything I can say
or do to make it better...

1499
01:27:36,582 --> 01:27:38,109
Give me your PAR data.
That's a start.

1500
01:27:51,428 --> 01:27:52,431
What are you doing?

1501
01:27:55,569 --> 01:27:57,403
I'm giving this to her.
What does it look like?

1502
01:28:05,413 --> 01:28:07,446
I needed money
to start StormPAR.

1503
01:28:07,582 --> 01:28:10,106
That's why I went
into business with Riggs.

1504
01:28:10,242 --> 01:28:11,410
I want to help people,
too, Kate.

1505
01:28:11,545 --> 01:28:12,418
I really do.

1506
01:28:13,617 --> 01:28:15,289
I said what I said 'cause I...

1507
01:28:16,919 --> 01:28:18,083
I carry that guilt
with me, too.

1508
01:28:19,988 --> 01:28:21,592
Every single day
of my life, so...

1509
01:28:23,326 --> 01:28:25,297
I'm sorry.

1510
01:28:25,433 --> 01:28:28,699
Javi, why don't you stay
and help us?

1511
01:28:28,834 --> 01:28:30,502
That way, we could
finally solve this together.

1512
01:28:38,242 --> 01:28:40,545
You know, there was a time when
I'd do anything for you, Kate.

1513
01:28:46,620 --> 01:28:47,981
Javi.
Let's roll.

1514
01:28:48,116 --> 01:28:49,646
We got a storm developing
up near Enid.

1515
01:28:49,781 --> 01:28:50,816
Team's waiting.

1516
01:28:50,951 --> 01:28:52,755
I got to get back
to work.

1517
01:28:52,890 --> 01:28:54,955
The more data I get,
the better for business.

1518
01:29:00,134 --> 01:29:01,434
Sorry I stole your car.

1519
01:29:02,497 --> 01:29:03,469
It's all right.

1520
01:29:04,740 --> 01:29:05,768
Look...

1521
01:29:07,603 --> 01:29:08,705
Be careful out there.

1522
01:29:20,313 --> 01:29:22,148
Wow,
these scans are impressive.

1523
01:29:22,283 --> 01:29:25,083
I mean, it's
a complete map of the chaos.

1524
01:29:25,218 --> 01:29:29,026
Tyler, our moisture numbers
are off.

1525
01:29:29,161 --> 01:29:32,155
Currently, the polymer
is only absorbing
the existing raindrops,

1526
01:29:32,290 --> 01:29:33,597
not the moisture
from the humidity.

1527
01:29:33,733 --> 01:29:36,663
I mean, we need it
to precipitate out more.

1528
01:29:36,798 --> 01:29:39,033
So we need to make it rain.

1529
01:29:39,168 --> 01:29:41,236
They were cloud seeding
in Lawton a few years ago

1530
01:29:41,371 --> 01:29:42,503
for the farmers.

1531
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:44,103
Yeah. Yeah, silver iodide.

1532
01:29:45,478 --> 01:29:48,548
We could shoot rockets of that.

1533
01:29:48,684 --> 01:29:52,009
So, the silver iodide converts
the moisture into rain,

1534
01:29:52,144 --> 01:29:53,514
and then
the sodium polyacrylate,

1535
01:29:53,649 --> 01:29:54,881
we need a lot of it...

1536
01:29:55,017 --> 01:29:56,687
would pull the water
from the storm,

1537
01:29:57,654 --> 01:29:59,919
increasing the cold pool.

1538
01:30:00,055 --> 01:30:01,923
No faster way
to choke a tornado.

1539
01:30:02,997 --> 01:30:04,526
Hey, Lily.

1540
01:30:04,661 --> 01:30:06,763
Yeah, I couldn't get Boone.

1541
01:30:06,898 --> 01:30:08,501
No, we're gonna need you guys
for something.

1542
01:30:10,129 --> 01:30:11,728
No, no, no. We'll come to you.

1543
01:30:11,863 --> 01:30:12,901
All right.

1544
01:30:15,702 --> 01:30:17,103
Is this it?

1545
01:30:17,238 --> 01:30:18,669
Or you gonna come back
before you go home?

1546
01:30:18,804 --> 01:30:19,842
You know I will.

1547
01:30:22,415 --> 01:30:23,945
- Love you.
- Love you.

1548
01:30:25,283 --> 01:30:27,587
This is for you.

1549
01:30:27,722 --> 01:30:29,588
You have any idea what
you're getting yourself into?

1550
01:30:30,388 --> 01:30:31,381
I'm beginning to.

1551
01:30:37,856 --> 01:30:39,626
Huh. Thanks.

1552
01:30:39,761 --> 01:30:41,468
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1553
01:30:58,382 --> 01:30:59,409
Oh, Lord.

1554
01:31:00,617 --> 01:31:01,715
You finally made it.

1555
01:31:01,851 --> 01:31:03,953
Ben, you stuck around.

1556
01:31:04,089 --> 01:31:06,291
Turns out, there's more
to this story than I thought.

1557
01:31:06,426 --> 01:31:07,756
We got a new ending for you.

1558
01:31:07,891 --> 01:31:09,292
Look who it is. City girl.

1559
01:31:09,428 --> 01:31:10,893
What's up, Kate?

1560
01:31:11,029 --> 01:31:12,493
Finally decided to ditch
all those squares, huh?

1561
01:31:12,629 --> 01:31:14,061
Right on.

1562
01:31:14,196 --> 01:31:16,300
Mm-hmm. Yep.
Y'all missed a big one. Look.

1563
01:31:16,436 --> 01:31:18,267
- Oh, wow.
- See?

1564
01:31:18,402 --> 01:31:21,666
Hey, can you, um...
Can you rig that drone
to collect data?

1565
01:31:21,802 --> 01:31:23,400
I can do that.

1566
01:31:23,536 --> 01:31:25,078
Yeah,
she can do that.
- Easy. Easy.

1567
01:31:25,213 --> 01:31:28,307
Hey, buddy. I'm sorry.

1568
01:31:28,442 --> 01:31:30,548
- How do I make it up to you?
- Man, you abandoned me.

1569
01:31:30,684 --> 01:31:32,012
I don't know nothing
about no makeup.

1570
01:31:32,148 --> 01:31:33,883
How about we launch
some new rockets?

1571
01:31:36,487 --> 01:31:37,854
You said rockets?

1572
01:31:38,588 --> 01:31:41,521
Hey. Y'all ready?

1573
01:31:41,657 --> 01:31:43,853
We need a 40-foot trailer
that's light enough
for a pickup

1574
01:31:43,988 --> 01:31:47,994
but heavy enough
to anchor barrels
in 100-mile-an-hour winds.

1575
01:31:48,130 --> 01:31:49,503
Why the hell
would you want that?

1576
01:31:53,166 --> 01:31:54,639
Why the hell do we want that?

1577
01:31:54,775 --> 01:31:56,299
Well, 'cause when we drive
into a tornado,

1578
01:31:56,435 --> 01:31:57,674
we want whatever's
on the trailer

1579
01:31:57,810 --> 01:31:59,172
to get sucked into it,
but not us.

1580
01:32:01,008 --> 01:32:02,376
You're gonna want aluminum.

1581
01:32:02,511 --> 01:32:03,440
Okay.

1582
01:32:05,983 --> 01:32:08,379
Dexter, talk to me.
What's going on?

1583
01:32:08,515 --> 01:32:10,949
Testing
the Goldilocks principle
of a tornado

1584
01:32:11,084 --> 01:32:12,491
by modifying the variables,

1585
01:32:12,627 --> 01:32:14,127
hopefully disrupting
the process.

1586
01:32:14,262 --> 01:32:15,392
Mm-hmm. Okay.

1587
01:32:15,528 --> 01:32:17,054
Dani, what does that mean?

1588
01:32:17,190 --> 01:32:18,862
- Taming the storm.
- Right.

1589
01:32:21,094 --> 01:32:22,392
T, tell us what's going on.

1590
01:32:22,528 --> 01:32:23,962
All right,
we're gonna shoot the clouds

1591
01:32:24,098 --> 01:32:25,362
with rockets of silver iodide.

1592
01:32:25,497 --> 01:32:27,036
Yeah,
makes 'em rain, right?

1593
01:32:27,171 --> 01:32:29,005
Yep. Rain is
what we need in the updraft.

1594
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:31,538
And then we're gonna take
the sodium polyacrylate

1595
01:32:31,673 --> 01:32:33,404
and we're gonna deliver it
in the vortex...
Don't touch that.

1596
01:32:35,482 --> 01:32:36,911
Increasing the cold pool.

1597
01:32:37,047 --> 01:32:39,745
And that does what
to the tornado?

1598
01:32:39,881 --> 01:32:40,851
Cuts the fuel, Ben.

1599
01:32:41,849 --> 01:32:43,382
Lily.

1600
01:32:43,517 --> 01:32:45,457
Oh, look at Cairo
looking all cute and whatnot.

1601
01:32:45,592 --> 01:32:46,422
- Hey, buddy.

1602
01:33:26,565 --> 01:33:28,091
She is your story, Ben.

1603
01:33:34,969 --> 01:33:36,137
Get me a copy of that.

1604
01:33:37,774 --> 01:33:39,008
Let's get out of here.

1605
01:33:42,612 --> 01:33:46,785
Uh, no offense, but I'm gonna
get a ride with someone else.

1606
01:34:09,441 --> 01:34:10,571
That's it.

1607
01:34:10,706 --> 01:34:11,973
Hell yeah.

1608
01:34:12,109 --> 01:34:14,477
- We got it. We got it.
- All right.

1609
01:34:23,617 --> 01:34:25,786
Okay, ground speed's at 22.
Intercept is northeast.

1610
01:34:25,921 --> 01:34:27,419
Look for Siloam Road.

1611
01:34:28,592 --> 01:34:29,520
Siloam Road.

1612
01:34:37,968 --> 01:34:39,870
- Whoa, whoa!

1613
01:34:40,005 --> 01:34:41,533
- Come on!
- Hey, what are you doing?

1614
01:34:41,668 --> 01:34:44,502
Hey! These storm buttheads
are cutting us off, man.

1615
01:34:47,274 --> 01:34:48,538
I told you we didn't need her.

1616
01:34:48,673 --> 01:34:50,376
All right,
let's not get distracted.

1617
01:34:52,116 --> 01:34:53,720
Let's get these babies
in the air!

1618
01:35:05,932 --> 01:35:07,996
I can't see it right now.
I lost it.

1619
01:35:08,132 --> 01:35:09,201
It's tracking
straight ahead.

1620
01:35:09,336 --> 01:35:10,503
I'd say push it.

1621
01:35:10,638 --> 01:35:11,831
Get ahead of it,
get ahead of it.

1622
01:35:22,977 --> 01:35:24,310
Doppler went dark.

1623
01:35:24,446 --> 01:35:25,911
That's probably
a dead cell zone.

1624
01:35:26,047 --> 01:35:27,721
Lily, are you above us?

1625
01:35:29,054 --> 01:35:30,652
It's getting
completely rain-wrapped.

1626
01:35:30,788 --> 01:35:32,088
I can't see a thing.

1627
01:35:35,392 --> 01:35:37,128
We just got to push through
this rain curtain.

1628
01:35:37,264 --> 01:35:38,094
Oh.

1629
01:35:41,602 --> 01:35:43,192
Yeah, I just lost my drone.

1630
01:35:43,328 --> 01:35:44,599
Hey, we lost visual.

1631
01:35:57,078 --> 01:35:58,577
I can't see anything.

1632
01:35:58,712 --> 01:36:00,049
That's all right.
Just keep straight.

1633
01:36:00,185 --> 01:36:01,113
I can see the road.
You see the road?

1634
01:36:01,248 --> 01:36:02,546
This feels different.

1635
01:36:02,681 --> 01:36:04,087
I'm telling you,
I think we should stop.

1636
01:36:04,222 --> 01:36:05,416
Just keep going.
We'll get ahead of it.

1637
01:36:05,552 --> 01:36:06,725
- Scott, we have to stop!
- Keep going!

1638
01:36:06,860 --> 01:36:07,590
- We'll get ahead of it!
- Oh, shit!

1639
01:36:09,227 --> 01:36:10,221
- Oh, God! It's right there!

1640
01:36:10,357 --> 01:36:11,792
It's right there! Right there!

1641
01:36:11,928 --> 01:36:14,023
Get down! Get down!

1642
01:36:14,158 --> 01:36:15,025
Javi!

1643
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:19,366
- Oh, God.

1644
01:36:23,237 --> 01:36:25,370
- Oh!
- Hold on, y'all.

1645
01:36:25,506 --> 01:36:26,712
Tyler,
we got to do something.

1646
01:36:26,848 --> 01:36:28,409
Hey!
On your left, guys!

1647
01:36:28,545 --> 01:36:29,816
- It's hitting something big!

1648
01:36:31,249 --> 01:36:33,281
Oh, my God.

1649
01:36:41,595 --> 01:36:43,687
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1650
01:36:43,823 --> 01:36:45,826
Wait, wait, wait.
We can't just leave them.

1651
01:36:45,961 --> 01:36:47,328
We're not gonna leave them,
but we got to move!
We got to move!

1652
01:36:49,934 --> 01:36:51,798
Back up, back up, back up!

1653
01:36:51,933 --> 01:36:53,636
Dex! Go! Go!

1654
01:36:53,772 --> 01:36:55,435
It's flying at us, man!

1655
01:36:55,570 --> 01:36:56,700
- Go faster!
I'm going, I'm going!

1656
01:37:06,353 --> 01:37:07,546
Oh!

1657
01:37:11,458 --> 01:37:12,353
Javi.

1658
01:37:27,803 --> 01:37:28,633
Oh, God.

1659
01:37:29,244 --> 01:37:30,140
Hang on.

1660
01:37:39,317 --> 01:37:41,415
Come on, come on.
Hang on, Scott.

1661
01:37:45,285 --> 01:37:46,519
Go, go, go, go, go!

1662
01:37:50,632 --> 01:37:51,997
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1663
01:38:10,474 --> 01:38:11,841
Is everybody okay?

1664
01:38:12,650 --> 01:38:14,249
Yeah.

1665
01:38:14,385 --> 01:38:16,052
We're okay.
- Yeah, we're good, man.

1666
01:38:16,188 --> 01:38:18,056
- We're moving.
- Are you seeing this?

1667
01:38:20,487 --> 01:38:22,390
Look at the size of that thing.

1668
01:38:23,663 --> 01:38:24,524
This is good.

1669
01:38:26,667 --> 01:38:27,659
No, that ain't good.

1670
01:38:28,667 --> 01:38:29,562
That ain't good.

1671
01:38:30,967 --> 01:38:32,433
It's shifting.

1672
01:38:48,045 --> 01:38:49,213
All right, that's it.
That's the game.

1673
01:38:49,348 --> 01:38:50,448
Get off the field!

1674
01:38:58,629 --> 01:39:00,630
Okay, guys, there's nothing
we can do to stop it,

1675
01:39:00,765 --> 01:39:02,934
but when you get there,
make sure people get to
a safe place.

1676
01:39:03,069 --> 01:39:04,236
All right, Dani,
where am I headed?

1677
01:39:06,098 --> 01:39:07,930
There's... there's a...
There's a kids' park on Main.

1678
01:39:08,065 --> 01:39:09,465
<i>Make sure to get people
to basements,</i>

1679
01:39:09,601 --> 01:39:11,308
<i>uh, big buildings, no windows.</i>

1680
01:39:11,443 --> 01:39:14,140
<i>Stay away from windows.
No cars, all right?</i>

1681
01:39:14,276 --> 01:39:15,807
All right, careful, y'all.

1682
01:39:15,942 --> 01:39:17,445
<i>Stay safe out there. Copy.</i>

1683
01:39:19,250 --> 01:39:20,379
Wizard, come to us.
We're gonna...

1684
01:39:20,515 --> 01:39:21,312
We're gonna find
a new position,

1685
01:39:21,447 --> 01:39:22,648
put these radars down.

1686
01:39:37,533 --> 01:39:39,071
They're running from it.
They're scared.

1687
01:39:40,367 --> 01:39:42,105
They're not running.

1688
01:39:42,241 --> 01:39:43,735
They're heading into town
to help.

1689
01:39:45,339 --> 01:39:46,971
Look, we got to go, too.

1690
01:39:47,106 --> 01:39:49,008
No, we got
our access road here,
on the left.

1691
01:39:49,144 --> 01:39:50,511
- Coming up.
- Nah, man, there's
a lot of people there, man.

1692
01:39:50,646 --> 01:39:51,607
We got... I think
we should follow 'em.

1693
01:39:51,742 --> 01:39:53,813
Whose side are you on, man?

1694
01:39:53,949 --> 01:39:56,218
You want to go hang out with
your little girlfriend? Go.

1695
01:39:56,354 --> 01:39:57,782
But we got the team
waiting for us,

1696
01:39:57,917 --> 01:39:59,555
and we got the storm
of a century out there!

1697
01:39:59,691 --> 01:40:01,392
- What are you talking about?
- Slow down, stop the tr--

1698
01:40:01,528 --> 01:40:03,062
- The people! There's people!
- I don't care about the people!

1699
01:40:03,197 --> 01:40:05,289
Stop the truck, Javi!
We're planting here!

1700
01:40:05,425 --> 01:40:06,324
We need to go help!

1701
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:08,391
Javi, stop the damn truck!

1702
01:40:14,003 --> 01:40:14,898
Good choice.

1703
01:40:17,404 --> 01:40:19,311
Tell Riggs we're done!

1704
01:40:21,143 --> 01:40:22,378
Damn it, Javi!

1705
01:40:27,284 --> 01:40:28,615
All right,
run to your mom.

1706
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:34,219
Hey, everyone!
Get inside, all right?

1707
01:40:34,355 --> 01:40:35,687
Guys, let's go, go, go!

1708
01:40:35,823 --> 01:40:37,228
There's a shelter down there!
Come on!

1709
01:40:37,363 --> 01:40:39,391
Hey, no!
Leave your cars! Get inside!

1710
01:40:39,526 --> 01:40:41,627
It's not safe here! Come on!

1711
01:40:41,763 --> 01:40:43,029
- Hey! Everyone, go inside!
- Let's go, guys.

1712
01:41:07,519 --> 01:41:08,592
Guys!

1713
01:41:08,727 --> 01:41:09,861
Tyler!

1714
01:41:09,997 --> 01:41:12,197
Tyler! Shelters are all full!

1715
01:41:12,333 --> 01:41:14,028
We got to get everyone
to the movie theater!

1716
01:41:14,164 --> 01:41:15,762
Move! Everybody inside!

1717
01:41:15,898 --> 01:41:17,432
Sir, sir, you got to leave it.
You got to leave it.

1718
01:41:17,568 --> 01:41:19,028
Leave it, leave it!
Come on, come on!

1719
01:41:19,163 --> 01:41:20,830
Let it go, let it go!
Come on, come on!

1720
01:41:20,966 --> 01:41:22,907
Guys, it's here!
You got to get inside!

1721
01:41:26,337 --> 01:41:28,840
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

1722
01:41:31,417 --> 01:41:33,413
Come on. We're almost there.
I got you.

1723
01:41:33,548 --> 01:41:35,517
Come on! Get in, get in!
Come on!

1724
01:41:37,853 --> 01:41:40,055
Come on, come on!
You got to go! It's here!

1725
01:41:40,190 --> 01:41:41,784
Get inside, everybody!

1726
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:44,460
- Come on!

1727
01:41:59,745 --> 01:42:01,140
Tyler!

1728
01:42:04,079 --> 01:42:05,012
Okay.

1729
01:42:07,049 --> 01:42:08,286
Come on.

1730
01:42:21,430 --> 01:42:23,235
- Watch out!

1731
01:42:27,198 --> 01:42:29,835
- You got to get inside!
- I'm not leaving you!

1732
01:42:31,744 --> 01:42:32,640
Kate.

1733
01:42:37,643 --> 01:42:39,185
Come on, Kate! Lift!

1734
01:42:40,083 --> 01:42:41,015
Okay.

1735
01:42:43,124 --> 01:42:44,113
- Let's go, let's go!
- Come on!

1736
01:43:11,844 --> 01:43:13,742
See if you can find a basement!

1737
01:43:13,878 --> 01:43:15,478
I'll check the other side!

1738
01:43:29,964 --> 01:43:31,499
There's no basement
on the other side!

1739
01:43:31,634 --> 01:43:33,230
There's nothing
over here either!

1740
01:43:33,365 --> 01:43:35,802
This theater isn't built
to withstand what's coming!

1741
01:43:51,683 --> 01:43:52,750
There you go.

1742
01:43:52,885 --> 01:43:53,754
- You got her?
- I got her.

1743
01:43:57,227 --> 01:43:58,231
Where's Kate?

1744
01:44:39,003 --> 01:44:40,229
Kate!

1745
01:44:41,566 --> 01:44:42,440
Kate!

1746
01:44:48,245 --> 01:44:49,139
Where's Kate?

1747
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:58,315
No, Kate!

1748
01:45:58,450 --> 01:45:59,710
- Tyler! Tyler!
- Kate! Kate!

1749
01:45:59,846 --> 01:46:01,354
- Tyler!
- Get him in!

1750
01:46:04,156 --> 01:46:04,984
Doors!

1751
01:46:13,966 --> 01:46:14,895
Damn!

1752
01:46:21,806 --> 01:46:23,502
Stay down,
stay down, stay down!

1753
01:46:23,638 --> 01:46:25,169
Go, go, go! Go, go, go!

1754
01:46:25,304 --> 01:46:27,071
That way, that way!
You have to get down!

1755
01:46:27,207 --> 01:46:28,179
- Get down!
- That's it. Don't look back.

1756
01:46:28,314 --> 01:46:29,276
Don't look back. Keep going.

1757
01:46:31,483 --> 01:46:33,212
We got to get these people...

1758
01:46:33,348 --> 01:46:35,811
We got to help get these people
to the back of the theater.

1759
01:46:35,947 --> 01:46:37,583
Tyler, come on. Come on!

1760
01:46:37,718 --> 01:46:39,716
Hey. We got to go, T.

1761
01:46:39,851 --> 01:46:40,987
Come on. Come on.

1762
01:46:49,860 --> 01:46:51,866
Okay.

1763
01:46:59,339 --> 01:47:00,737
- Come on, come on, come on.

1764
01:47:06,014 --> 01:47:07,317
Take my hand.
You got to get up.

1765
01:47:07,453 --> 01:47:10,484
Get back! Get back! Get back!

1766
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:11,818
You're okay, you're okay.

1767
01:47:11,953 --> 01:47:12,881
- Slow it down.
Hold tight!

1768
01:47:13,017 --> 01:47:14,086
Get down, get down!

1769
01:47:15,961 --> 01:47:17,986
- Push in, push in!
<i>It's alive.</i>

1770
01:47:18,122 --> 01:47:19,561
<i>It's alive! It's alive!</i>

1771
01:47:19,696 --> 01:47:21,295
- It's alive!
Hold on!

1772
01:47:30,638 --> 01:47:32,110
Come on. Come on.

1773
01:48:52,854 --> 01:48:55,521
- Lily! No!

1774
01:48:55,657 --> 01:48:57,156
Tyler! Tyler!

1775
01:49:00,090 --> 01:49:02,293
- Don't let go, don't let go,
don't let go.
I got you!

1776
01:49:25,755 --> 01:49:28,022
- Thank you.

1777
01:49:35,327 --> 01:49:37,002
- Are you all right?
- Mm-hmm.

1778
01:49:37,137 --> 01:49:38,230
You okay?

1779
01:50:20,774 --> 01:50:21,746
Kate.

1780
01:50:22,975 --> 01:50:23,972
Kate.

1781
01:50:24,107 --> 01:50:25,315
Careful.

1782
01:50:25,450 --> 01:50:26,583
You okay?

1783
01:50:26,719 --> 01:50:28,015
Easy.

1784
01:50:28,151 --> 01:50:29,281
Is everyone okay?
- Easy, easy.

1785
01:50:31,081 --> 01:50:32,020
Is it okay?

1786
01:50:35,828 --> 01:50:37,993
- Did it help?
- You did it, Kate.

1787
01:50:38,891 --> 01:50:39,962
You did it.

1788
01:50:42,032 --> 01:50:43,636
- Kate, it worked.

1789
01:50:46,371 --> 01:50:47,332
You okay?

1790
01:50:53,775 --> 01:50:56,109
Oh, my God,
that was amazing.
Oh, my God.

1791
01:50:56,245 --> 01:50:57,974
We thought you were
a goner for sure.

1792
01:50:58,109 --> 01:50:59,115
You're brilliant.

1793
01:50:59,251 --> 01:51:00,911
Mm-hmm.

1794
01:51:01,047 --> 01:51:02,450
I think I love you.

1795
01:51:04,088 --> 01:51:05,781
I thought for certain
I was gonna fly.

1796
01:51:05,917 --> 01:51:07,791
No, you did fly.
Honestly.

1797
01:51:22,437 --> 01:51:24,810
Door-to-door service,
just like I promised.

1798
01:51:24,945 --> 01:51:27,475
- Brought you back in one piece.
- Yeah, just about.

1799
01:51:30,346 --> 01:51:32,676
Look, when you get to New York,
with the review board,

1800
01:51:32,812 --> 01:51:35,247
they're gonna say that it was
the fire from the refinery

1801
01:51:35,383 --> 01:51:37,154
or the smoke
or a million other things

1802
01:51:37,289 --> 01:51:39,085
that caused that tornado to
vanish, and that's fine, too.

1803
01:51:39,220 --> 01:51:40,348
But the point is,
is that we know

1804
01:51:40,484 --> 01:51:41,892
these things can be disrupted,

1805
01:51:42,027 --> 01:51:43,055
and we need
a whole new branch of research

1806
01:51:43,190 --> 01:51:45,159
on how to harness these storms.

1807
01:51:45,294 --> 01:51:47,456
Are you sure
you don't want to do the pitch?

1808
01:51:47,592 --> 01:51:48,961
It sounds like
you want to do it.

1809
01:51:49,096 --> 01:51:52,167
Nah. Nah, partner.

1810
01:51:52,302 --> 01:51:53,871
Go get us that money,
you know what I'm saying?

1811
01:51:54,006 --> 01:51:56,874
I ditched Riggs, all right?
Fresh start.

1812
01:51:57,009 --> 01:51:58,568
Maybe it's time to renovate
the old barn.

1813
01:51:59,645 --> 01:52:01,637
I like that. I like that.

1814
01:52:02,942 --> 01:52:04,977
Whoa, Owens!

1815
01:52:05,113 --> 01:52:07,084
- StormPAR.

1816
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:08,215
Sapulpa.

1817
01:52:10,385 --> 01:52:12,381
Still not telling me
when you're coming back?

1818
01:52:12,516 --> 01:52:14,727
I don't know. This could be it.

1819
01:52:18,765 --> 01:52:20,293
Can't tell
if you're joking or not.

1820
01:52:23,366 --> 01:52:26,365
Well, maybe if you feel it,
you should chase it.

1821
01:52:33,943 --> 01:52:35,643
Give me a call, all right?

1822
01:52:35,779 --> 01:52:37,112
Let me know how it goes.

1823
01:52:39,011 --> 01:52:40,786
Safe flight.

1824
01:52:40,921 --> 01:52:43,217
Okay, time's up.
You got to move your car.

1825
01:52:44,017 --> 01:52:45,087
Yo, come on, man.

1826
01:52:46,392 --> 01:52:47,419
Seriously?

1827
01:52:49,926 --> 01:52:52,021
- Let me get a, uh, tow truck
up here to departures.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1828
01:52:52,157 --> 01:52:54,696
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm-I'm gonna move.
I'm gonna move.
