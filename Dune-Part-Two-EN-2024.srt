00:00:53,195 --> 00:00:57,808
Imperial Diary. Year 10,191.
Third comment.

6
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:04,510
The battle for Arrakis
took everyone by surprise.

7
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:06,929
There were no witnesses.

8
00:01:08,906 --> 00:01:11,909
The Harkonnen operation
was perpetrated overnight,

9
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:15,869
without warning or declaration of war.

10
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:20,483
By morning, the Atreides were no more.

11
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,355
All died in the dark.

12
00:01:32,408 --> 00:01:33,974
And the Emperor said...

13
00:01:37,456 --> 00:01:38,240
nothing.

14
00:01:41,025 --> 00:01:43,475
Since that night, my father
has not been the same.

15
00:01:44,768 --> 00:01:45,595
Nor have I.

16
00:01:47,553 --> 00:01:50,904
His inaction
is difficult for me to accept.

17
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:53,907
For, I know he loved
Duke Leto Atreides like a son.

18
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:02,002
But my father's always been guided

19
00:02:02,177 --> 00:02:06,355
by the calculus of power.

20
00:02:06,529 --> 00:02:10,079
This would not be the first time the
Harkonnens have done his dirty work.

21
00:02:18,106 --> 00:02:20,456
In the shadows of Arrakis
lie many secrets...

22
00:02:23,111 --> 00:02:25,287
but the darkest of them all may remain.

23
00:02:27,115 --> 00:02:28,725
The end of House Atreides.

24
00:02:44,828 --> 00:02:48,048
Sister, Father is dead.

25
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,402
Shouldn't you go back to the stars,

26
00:02:52,357 --> 00:02:53,141
be with him?

27
00:02:55,969 --> 00:02:59,319
I'm afraid I won't have enough time
to fix things before your coming.

28
00:03:01,584 --> 00:03:03,847
This world is beyond cruelty.

29
00:03:40,231 --> 00:03:42,538
Enemy.

30
00:04:10,653 --> 00:04:12,045
Stay here.

31
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:41,205
Down. Right.

32
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,828
They're close.

33
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:07,552
Do you hear that?

34
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:12,296
The rats are calling a worm.

35
00:06:18,258 --> 00:06:20,826
Worms!

36
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,525
Unit, climb. Now!

37
00:07:14,924 --> 00:07:16,404
Look for wormsign.

38
00:07:30,461 --> 00:07:31,549
We're okay.

39
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,037
Shields!

40
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,038
No Shields!

41
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:44,840
I got you, rat.

42
00:09:01,421 --> 00:09:04,555
Never stand with your
back towards the open.

43
00:09:04,729 --> 00:09:06,473
How many times do I have
to tell you that, huh?

44
00:09:06,557 --> 00:09:08,603
You okay?

45
00:09:08,777 --> 00:09:11,040
- Yeah.
- How 'bout her?

46
00:09:13,172 --> 00:09:14,086
She's fine.

47
00:09:20,615 --> 00:09:24,749
They do not usually venture this deep.

48
00:09:24,923 --> 00:09:26,667
They wanna make sure no Atreides escaped.

49
00:09:26,751 --> 00:09:29,145
You think too much of yourself.

50
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,843
No, no, we are in the deep desert.

51
00:09:32,017 --> 00:09:34,716
Only Fremen can survive here.

52
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,153
They were here for us, not for you.

53
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:40,112
Don't worry.

54
00:09:40,286 --> 00:09:43,246
I'm taking you somewhere
they will never find us.

55
00:10:00,655 --> 00:10:02,570
Filthy water.

56
00:10:02,744 --> 00:10:06,748
It's full of chemicals,
but good enough for cooling systems.

57
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:11,796
Don't let it out.

58
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,235
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

59
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:17,497
Don't let that out.

60
00:10:17,672 --> 00:10:19,717
Don't let it out!

61
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,300
I'm okay.
Are you sure?

62
00:10:25,331 --> 00:10:26,115
Mm-hmm.

63
00:10:30,859 --> 00:10:31,990
You fought well...

64
00:10:33,122 --> 00:10:34,297
once you woke up.

65
00:10:35,646 --> 00:10:36,546
I wasn't sleeping.

66
00:11:08,026 --> 00:11:09,985
No, no, no. I'll do it.

67
00:12:14,092 --> 00:12:16,704
Lor-- Lord Rabban.

68
00:12:16,878 --> 00:12:19,028
Now that the spice fields
have been secured,

69
00:12:19,054 --> 00:12:22,304
I strongly recommend bringing all
troops out of Fremen territories.

70
00:12:22,361 --> 00:12:24,149
We're losing too many men to the desert.

71
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:25,538
Rats.

72
00:12:27,323 --> 00:12:30,152
- I beg your pardon?
- We're losing men to rats.

73
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:35,374
Fremen!
I can't confirm, my Lord.

74
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:37,292
Communications are hectic
in the open sands.

75
00:12:37,376 --> 00:12:40,162
Your orders were to control
the whole planet.

76
00:12:42,207 --> 00:12:44,993
- We are.
- I see only half of it.

77
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:46,385
As you may recall,

78
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:49,171
the South is uninhabitable, my Lord.

79
00:12:51,651 --> 00:12:53,349
May I suggest you get some rest?

80
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:56,265
Rats! Hairy rats!

81
00:12:56,439 --> 00:12:58,658
Kill them! Kill them!
Kill them all!

82
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,617
Kill them all!

83
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,098
Rats!

84
00:13:49,535 --> 00:13:51,035
He's asking why we're so late.

85
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:57,848
He thinks you're spies.

86
00:13:58,022 --> 00:14:00,198
You're not welcome here.

87
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,635
- He said--
- I got that.

88
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:06,074
Thanks. Stay close to me. Hmm?

89
00:14:26,442 --> 00:14:27,486
Sietch Tabr.

90
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:23,629
Jamis! Jamis!

91
00:15:23,803 --> 00:15:26,110
You killed Jamis!

92
00:15:26,284 --> 00:15:27,459
Spies!

93
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:28,983
Witch!

94
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,565
Stop! Stop!

95
00:15:48,263 --> 00:15:50,656
They don't know what they're saying.

96
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:54,747
Lisan al-Gaib!
Lisan al-Gaib!

97
00:15:56,793 --> 00:15:59,665
Mahdi!

98
00:16:01,624 --> 00:16:02,842
Lisan al-Gaib!

99
00:16:05,193 --> 00:16:09,719
I need your guidance
with the two foreigners.

100
00:16:09,893 --> 00:16:12,504
Give them back to the desert.

101
00:16:14,593 --> 00:16:16,378
I saw the signs.

102
00:16:16,552 --> 00:16:17,335
Again.

103
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,037
Stilgar, your faith is
playing tricks on you.

104
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:27,041
The Lisan al-Gaib has not
shown his face yet!

105
00:16:31,306 --> 00:16:35,310
He killed Jamis in a fair fight.

106
00:16:35,484 --> 00:16:38,748
He speaks our language.

107
00:16:38,922 --> 00:16:41,838
He will quickly learn our ways.

108
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:47,583
I'm ready to pledge my life for him.

109
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:52,675
The desert will handle his fate.

110
00:16:54,503 --> 00:16:58,681
What about the woman?

111
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:05,415
Look how your Bene Gesserit
propaganda has taken root.

112
00:17:08,343 --> 00:17:10,543
Some of them already think
I'm their messiah.

113
00:17:12,129 --> 00:17:13,174
Others...

114
00:17:14,914 --> 00:17:15,872
false prophet.

115
00:17:17,482 --> 00:17:20,398
I must sway the non-believers.

116
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:23,445
If they follow me, we can
disrupt spice production.

117
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:25,819
That's the only way
I can get to the Emperor.

118
00:17:27,144 --> 00:17:28,994
Your father didn't believe in revenge.

119
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:30,713
Yeah, well, I do.

120
00:18:04,355 --> 00:18:05,255
What is happening?

121
00:18:07,097 --> 00:18:08,497
Too spicy for the foreigner?

122
00:18:14,365 --> 00:18:15,584
What is it?

123
00:18:15,758 --> 00:18:17,499
There is spice in the food.

124
00:18:17,673 --> 00:18:19,273
He'll look pretty with blue eyes.

125
00:18:19,936 --> 00:18:20,806
Don't mock him.

126
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,400
He deserves our respect.
He's a good fighter.

127
00:18:27,987 --> 00:18:29,250
Woman.

128
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:33,602
Come with me.

129
00:18:33,776 --> 00:18:36,474
To the well, our water we return.

130
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:40,087
We bless our brother, Jamis.

131
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:46,196
Thirty-eight million decaliters.

132
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:51,810
None of us, even dying of thirst,
would ever drink this water.

133
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:53,029
This is...

134
00:19:54,465 --> 00:19:55,597
sacred.

135
00:19:59,818 --> 00:20:00,906
Jamis' water.

136
00:20:02,517 --> 00:20:05,737
We have a thousand such places.

137
00:20:06,912 --> 00:20:10,133
When we have enough water,

138
00:20:10,307 --> 00:20:14,703
the Lisan al-Gaib will change
the face of Arrakis.

139
00:20:14,877 --> 00:20:17,377
He will bring back the trees.
He will bring back...

140
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,578
a Green Paradise.

141
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:25,279
So many souls.

142
00:20:35,898 --> 00:20:39,467
Never give your water away,
not even for the dead. Hmm?

143
00:20:42,383 --> 00:20:43,783
Why are you showing me this?

144
00:20:43,949 --> 00:20:45,449
Because you are Bene Gesserit.

145
00:20:45,603 --> 00:20:49,433
Because you understand the prophecies.

146
00:20:49,607 --> 00:20:52,915
The mother of the Lisan al-Gaib
 will be a Reverend Mother.

147
00:20:54,308 --> 00:20:56,658
Our Reverend Mother is dying.

148
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:00,618
You want me to take her place?

149
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,578
Yes, I do.

150
00:21:06,189 --> 00:21:07,451
You believe in Paul?

151
00:21:10,324 --> 00:21:11,716
There are signs.

152
00:21:13,152 --> 00:21:14,806
Yes.

153
00:21:16,678 --> 00:21:18,201
What if I would refuse?

154
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:21,117
Mmm.
Then, he's not Lisan al-Gaib,

155
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,206
and you have no purpose to serve.

156
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:27,166
What else is left to do then but
to return your water to the well?

157
00:21:27,341 --> 00:21:28,777
Huh.

158
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:33,633
It's an honor, isn't it?

159
00:21:35,523 --> 00:21:37,073
I think you should feel honored.

160
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:39,051
Well, it was a choice
between this or death,

161
00:21:39,135 --> 00:21:41,385
so, you know, forgive me
if I'm not flattered.

162
00:21:43,139 --> 00:21:44,709
How does one become a Reverend Mother?

163
00:21:44,793 --> 00:21:46,711
It's different from one culture
to another.

164
00:21:46,795 --> 00:21:48,623
Here on Arrakis,
I have no idea.

165
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:55,194
You're afraid.

166
00:21:55,369 --> 00:21:57,200
Reverend Mothers are tasked
with holding the memories

167
00:21:57,284 --> 00:21:59,027
of all the Reverend Mothers
that came before them,

168
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:02,289
so I'll be given centuries
of pain and sorrow.

169
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:03,899
Is it dangerous?

170
00:22:04,943 --> 00:22:06,423
It's lethal for men.

171
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,904
That's for sure.

172
00:23:17,451 --> 00:23:19,191
What are you guys laughing about?

173
00:23:19,366 --> 00:23:20,367
Don't bother.

174
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:26,854
You don't believe in all this?

175
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:28,375
No, we don't.

176
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:30,202
These are old Southern beliefs.

177
00:23:30,377 --> 00:23:32,379
Southern beliefs?

178
00:23:32,553 --> 00:23:35,853
Southern tribes believe a messiah
will come to deliver us from evil.

179
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:37,906
You don't believe in the Lisan al-Gaib?

180
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,299
We believe in Fremen.

181
00:23:40,474 --> 00:23:42,780
Amen.

182
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:45,830
You want to control people,
you tell them a messiah will come.

183
00:23:45,914 --> 00:23:49,396
- Mm-hmm.
- Then they'll wait for centuries.

184
00:23:52,616 --> 00:23:55,663
Now, we must pray.

185
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,367
What about him?

186
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:06,064
- Stilgar?
- Mm-hmm.

187
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:08,980
He's from the South.
You didn't notice his accent?

188
00:24:18,294 --> 00:24:19,694
What'll happen to my mother?

189
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:20,880
She'll drink worm piss.

190
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,386
Not funny.

191
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,909
He's about to lose her.

192
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:27,172
If she's stupid enough to drink poison.

193
00:24:28,913 --> 00:24:32,743
Shut up!
We are praying.

194
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:44,494
I must not fear.
Fear is the mind-killer.

195
00:24:44,668 --> 00:24:47,454
Fear, the little death
that brings total obliteration.

196
00:24:47,628 --> 00:24:49,630
I will face my fear. I will...

197
00:24:54,722 --> 00:24:58,465
Here is the Water of Life.

198
00:24:58,639 --> 00:25:00,423
It frees the soul.

199
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,904
If you drink,

200
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:05,907
you shall die.

201
00:25:09,214 --> 00:25:10,868
If you drink,

202
00:25:13,175 --> 00:25:14,611
you may see.

203
00:25:14,785 --> 00:25:15,612
Drink!

204
00:25:16,483 --> 00:25:17,222
What is it?

205
00:25:17,396 --> 00:25:18,310
Drink!

206
00:26:39,827 --> 00:26:42,307
What have we done?

207
00:26:43,265 --> 00:26:44,701
She is pregnant.

208
00:26:59,281 --> 00:27:00,369
That was no miracle!

209
00:27:00,543 --> 00:27:02,043
You saw it with your own eyes!

210
00:27:04,808 --> 00:27:06,549
The mother of the Lisan al-Gaib

211
00:27:06,723 --> 00:27:09,030
shall survive the Holy Poison

212
00:27:09,204 --> 00:27:11,467
and She did, as written!

213
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:15,950
Her people wrote that!

214
00:27:16,124 --> 00:27:17,473
Blasphemy.

215
00:27:17,647 --> 00:27:20,084
The prophecy has been accomplished.

216
00:27:20,258 --> 00:27:23,044
The Mahdi must be Fremen!

217
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,876
Arrakis must be freed by its own people!

218
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:31,356
She's right. She's right!

219
00:27:33,576 --> 00:27:34,621
It's no miracle.

220
00:27:36,144 --> 00:27:38,886
My mother was trained to do that.

221
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:42,160
Poison transmutation is something
advanced Bene Gesserit can do.

222
00:27:45,501 --> 00:27:46,633
I'm not the Mahdi.

223
00:27:50,245 --> 00:27:51,463
I'm not here to lead.

224
00:27:53,857 --> 00:27:55,772
I'm here to learn your ways.

225
00:27:57,818 --> 00:28:00,734
Let me fight beside you.
That's all I'm asking.

226
00:28:07,131 --> 00:28:13,877
The Mahdi is too humble
to say He is the Mahdi.

227
00:28:14,051 --> 00:28:16,140
Even more reason to know He is!

228
00:28:16,314 --> 00:28:20,971
As written!

229
00:28:24,366 --> 00:28:25,236
How are you?

230
00:28:26,324 --> 00:28:27,282
Better.

231
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:29,414
How is she?

232
00:28:31,025 --> 00:28:32,591
She was frightened, but she's...

233
00:28:34,202 --> 00:28:35,159
she's okay.

234
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,297
Paul.

235
00:28:45,604 --> 00:28:47,215
She talks to me.

236
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:52,176
She believes in you.

237
00:28:55,789 --> 00:28:58,269
She says...

238
00:28:58,443 --> 00:29:02,143
Kwisatz Haderach, show us the way.

239
00:29:04,362 --> 00:29:06,495
You're so close now.

240
00:29:06,669 --> 00:29:10,542
Only one step remains and you will
become the Kwisatz Haderach.

241
00:29:11,674 --> 00:29:13,371
Only one step remains.

242
00:29:14,372 --> 00:29:15,809
You must do what I did.

243
00:29:15,983 --> 00:29:19,247
You must drink the Water of Life.

244
00:29:19,421 --> 00:29:22,903
And your mind, it's gon-- it's
gonna open and you will see.

245
00:29:23,947 --> 00:29:25,557
You will see!

246
00:29:26,776 --> 00:29:29,648
The beauty and the horror!

247
00:29:34,088 --> 00:29:38,657
If you wanna fight with us,
first thing, you must learn

248
00:29:38,832 --> 00:29:40,747
to be one with the desert.

249
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:45,664
So, here is a tent and enough food.

250
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:50,452
I want you to cross
that small erg and come back.

251
00:29:51,235 --> 00:29:52,802
Travel by night.

252
00:29:52,976 --> 00:29:54,502
You know how to use a paracompass?

253
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:55,500
- Yes.
- Oh.

254
00:29:58,765 --> 00:30:00,165
Anything else I should know?

255
00:30:00,244 --> 00:30:02,594
Uh, beside the worms and the Harkonnens,

256
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:06,294
beware of the trapdoor spiders.

257
00:30:06,468 --> 00:30:09,776
Centipedes are very nasty.
Not the big ones.

258
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,690
They are harmless.

259
00:30:11,865 --> 00:30:15,346
But the little ones, you have
to worry about. And... Oh!

260
00:30:18,045 --> 00:30:21,526
Don't ever, ever listen to the jinn.

261
00:30:23,877 --> 00:30:25,313
- The jinn?
- Jinn.

262
00:30:25,487 --> 00:30:27,054
Desert spirits.

263
00:30:28,664 --> 00:30:31,101
They whisper at night.

264
00:30:35,453 --> 00:30:38,065
They, they can possess you.

265
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:42,243
Really, be careful.
They are demons.

266
00:30:45,507 --> 00:30:47,291
But it's true.
Don't listen to them.

267
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:53,080
He doesn't know how to cross.

268
00:30:53,254 --> 00:30:54,954
Stilgar is going to get him killed.

269
00:30:56,735 --> 00:30:58,215
What is he trying to prove?

270
00:30:58,389 --> 00:30:59,434
What do you think?

271
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:03,742
"The Prophet shall know
the ways of the desert."

272
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,230
I think it's for the best.

273
00:31:16,277 --> 00:31:18,366
What's this?

274
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,889
You care for him now?

275
00:31:21,325 --> 00:31:23,066
He's not like the other strangers.

276
00:31:24,589 --> 00:31:25,895
He's sincere.

277
00:32:12,811 --> 00:32:14,204
Jamis.

278
00:32:16,772 --> 00:32:18,992
You sandwalk like a drunk lizard.

279
00:32:22,343 --> 00:32:23,956
Yeah, I'm doing pretty good so far.

280
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,490
Yeah, well, you're not even
in worm territory yet.

281
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:47,096
You have to break up your rhythm.

282
00:32:51,241 --> 00:32:53,461
Like this.

283
00:32:53,635 --> 00:32:56,423
Now, that's interesting because
in the filmbooks I've studied,

284
00:32:56,507 --> 00:33:00,157
the anthropologists say, in order to properly
sandwalk, you actually have--

285
00:33:03,558 --> 00:33:05,690
Never mind. Please keep going.

286
00:33:34,197 --> 00:33:37,551
You know, I'm the only one who believes
you're gonna make it until summer?

287
00:33:37,635 --> 00:33:40,035
Everyone else thinks
you won't make it two weeks.

288
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:42,121
If you wanna follow us in the desert,

289
00:33:42,205 --> 00:33:43,644
you need to know how windtraps work.

290
00:33:43,728 --> 00:33:45,426
So, listen to me.

291
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,822
They're simple, but they require
constant attention.

292
00:33:47,906 --> 00:33:51,127
Uh, this right here,
it captures the moisture

293
00:33:51,301 --> 00:33:53,251
and then it carries it into that pocket.

294
00:33:53,956 --> 00:33:56,915
Uh, and these are the filters.

295
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:59,090
They need to be changed every three days.

296
00:34:00,528 --> 00:34:01,311
What?

297
00:34:06,142 --> 00:34:07,752
Stop looking at me like that.

298
00:34:13,236 --> 00:34:14,759
He's training with the Fremen.

299
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:16,848
He will be back soon.
Don't worry.

300
00:34:18,024 --> 00:34:18,850
Mm-hmm.

301
00:34:20,417 --> 00:34:23,812
You're right. If we want
to protect your brother,

302
00:34:23,986 --> 00:34:26,945
we need all the Fremen
to believe in the prophecy.

303
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:35,867
We must convert
the non-believers one by one.

304
00:34:38,087 --> 00:34:40,437
We need to start with the weaker ones.

305
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:43,310
The vulnerable ones.

306
00:34:45,051 --> 00:34:47,444
The ones who fear us.

307
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:13,079
Hey, get out of here. Go.

308
00:36:55,703 --> 00:36:57,313
You okay?
Yeah.

309
00:37:34,916 --> 00:37:35,917
Let's go! Move!

310
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,762
Load.

311
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:16,044
Chani!

312
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:21,919
Reload!

313
00:38:36,673 --> 00:38:38,153
Ugh! Reload.

314
00:38:38,327 --> 00:38:39,285
Oh, watch out!

315
00:38:56,127 --> 00:38:58,216
Its shield will only open when it fires.

316
00:38:58,391 --> 00:38:59,917
I know that. What do you
think I'm trying to do?

317
00:39:00,001 --> 00:39:02,960
I'll trigger it.
On my signal. Be ready.

318
00:39:25,722 --> 00:39:27,071
Go!

319
00:39:28,812 --> 00:39:30,553
Ah, shit!

320
00:39:33,295 --> 00:39:34,949
Go! Go!

321
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:21,256
You saw what he did.

322
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,693
He saw it coming,

323
00:40:23,867 --> 00:40:25,652
and he saved her life.

324
00:40:26,304 --> 00:40:28,089
He saw it.

325
00:40:28,263 --> 00:40:30,091
He can foresee.

326
00:40:33,007 --> 00:40:34,443
Muad'Dib likes his smell.

327
00:40:41,145 --> 00:40:42,799
Who taught you to fight like that?

328
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:44,540
- My old masters.
- Hmm.

329
00:40:44,714 --> 00:40:46,020
They were close friends.

330
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:52,330
They were massacred.
Alongside my father.

331
00:40:57,858 --> 00:41:00,904
You've been fighting
the Harkonnens for decades.

332
00:41:01,078 --> 00:41:03,429
My family's been fighting them
for centuries.

333
00:41:03,603 --> 00:41:08,434
I know everything about them. Their habits,
their ways of thinking.

334
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,873
You know everything about the desert.

335
00:41:09,957 --> 00:41:13,482
You harness the very power of it.

336
00:41:13,656 --> 00:41:18,400
We can stop them together,
bury them in the sand where they belong.

337
00:41:18,574 --> 00:41:20,794
So that this planet
can be yours once more.

338
00:41:20,968 --> 00:41:24,493
What would you have us do? Huh?

339
00:41:24,667 --> 00:41:26,495
What would you do, Stilgar?

340
00:41:26,669 --> 00:41:30,543
I? I would... would strike
even further north.

341
00:41:30,717 --> 00:41:32,501
Then I will go further north.

342
00:41:32,675 --> 00:41:35,420
And the further north you go,
the more likely it is you die.

343
00:41:35,504 --> 00:41:36,984
Then I'll die.

344
00:41:37,158 --> 00:41:39,639
Maybe you will too.

345
00:41:39,813 --> 00:41:43,469
But the others will keep going.

346
00:41:43,643 --> 00:41:46,863
And they won't stop
until the Fremen are free.

347
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,260
He deserves to be Fredaykin.

348
00:41:54,131 --> 00:41:55,829
He needs names, Stilgar.

349
00:41:56,482 --> 00:41:59,136
He does!

350
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:02,270
I see strength in you.

351
00:42:02,444 --> 00:42:03,532
Like Usul.

352
00:42:04,707 --> 00:42:07,797
The base of the pillar.

353
00:42:07,971 --> 00:42:09,103
Come, come.

354
00:42:19,417 --> 00:42:24,901
You shall be known among us as Usul.

355
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:26,686
- Usul.
- Usul.

356
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:30,733
Usul. And now, a Fedaykin is a fighter

357
00:42:30,907 --> 00:42:32,126
and needs a war name.

358
00:42:33,127 --> 00:42:34,476
You must choose.

359
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:40,650
How do you call the, uh...

360
00:42:42,223 --> 00:42:43,746
The small desert mouse, again?

361
00:42:45,443 --> 00:42:46,923
Muad'Dib?
Muad'Dib.

362
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:49,535
No, no, no.

363
00:42:49,709 --> 00:42:53,364
Muad'Dib is wise
in the ways of the desert.

364
00:42:53,539 --> 00:42:54,757
Muad'Dib...

365
00:42:55,845 --> 00:42:58,326
creates his own water.

366
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,156
The constellation that points to
the North Star, we call Muad'Dib.

367
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,027
"The One Who Points the Way."

368
00:43:05,899 --> 00:43:07,161
That is a powerful name.

369
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:16,083
Now you are our brother. Mmm.

370
00:43:16,257 --> 00:43:19,390
Paul Muad'Dib Usul.

371
00:43:25,832 --> 00:43:26,920
Muad'Dib Usul.

372
00:43:27,747 --> 00:43:28,791
Muad'Dib Usul.

373
00:43:30,837 --> 00:43:32,055
Muad'Dib Usul.

374
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,886
Muad'Dib Usul. Mm.

375
00:43:37,844 --> 00:43:38,671
Muad'Dib.

376
00:43:42,022 --> 00:43:42,892
Usul.

377
00:44:00,649 --> 00:44:03,043
Hey! Stilgar!

378
00:44:18,014 --> 00:44:19,363
Father, I found my way.

379
00:44:36,729 --> 00:44:37,643
It's breathtaking.

380
00:44:46,608 --> 00:44:47,653
Hmm.

381
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:53,441
Look. Right there. Spice.

382
00:44:53,615 --> 00:44:56,357
Arrakis is so beautiful
when the sun is low.

383
00:45:04,017 --> 00:45:08,456
Where you're from, does water
really fall from the sky?

384
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:10,676
Oh, hm, yes.

385
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:13,896
Sometimes it rains for weeks on Caladan.

386
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:16,377
Where you see sand here, imagine water.

387
00:45:19,641 --> 00:45:23,645
Our castle stands on cliffs
high above the sea.

388
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:26,604
If you dive in,
you can't reach the bottom.

389
00:45:26,779 --> 00:45:30,608
- You dive in?
- Yes, it's called swimming.

390
00:45:30,783 --> 00:45:33,350
I don't--
I don't believe you, Usul.

391
00:45:33,524 --> 00:45:34,612
Usul.

392
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:38,529
What's your secret name?

393
00:45:40,836 --> 00:45:42,533
Sihaya.

394
00:45:42,708 --> 00:45:43,839
- Sihaya.
- Hmm.

395
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:47,016
What does that mean?

396
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:48,844
Means Desert Spring.

397
00:45:49,018 --> 00:45:50,063
"Desert Spring."

398
00:45:52,021 --> 00:45:53,588
- I love it.
- I hate it.

399
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:56,634
It's from some stupid prophecy.

400
00:45:57,679 --> 00:45:58,724
I prefer Chani.

401
00:45:59,812 --> 00:46:01,204
I prefer Chani too, then.

402
00:46:08,385 --> 00:46:10,170
Do you think Stilgar would teach me?

403
00:46:10,344 --> 00:46:11,867
To ride?
Yeah.

404
00:46:12,041 --> 00:46:15,175
No. Only Fremen ride worms.

405
00:46:15,349 --> 00:46:17,006
Well, I thought I'd become one, didn't I?

406
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:18,874
By name, not by blood.

407
00:46:21,355 --> 00:46:25,925
Your blood comes
from Dukes and Great Houses.

408
00:46:28,014 --> 00:46:30,277
We don't have that here.

409
00:46:30,451 --> 00:46:34,324
Here, we're equal, men and women alike.

410
00:46:34,498 --> 00:46:36,587
What we do, we do for the benefit of all.

411
00:46:36,762 --> 00:46:38,912
Well, I'd very much like
to be equal to you.

412
00:46:45,248 --> 00:46:48,512
Paul Muad'Dib Usul...

413
00:46:50,427 --> 00:46:52,603
maybe you could be Fremen.

414
00:46:55,868 --> 00:46:57,268
Maybe I'll show you the way.

415
00:48:26,175 --> 00:48:27,437
Rabban.

416
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:42,800
Fremen attacks on your watch.

417
00:48:42,975 --> 00:48:48,763
Your orders were to restore spice
production to full capacity.

418
00:48:48,937 --> 00:48:51,157
Do you know what it means if you fail?

419
00:48:52,985 --> 00:48:56,814
The Emperor will take spice
out of our control.

420
00:48:57,903 --> 00:48:59,252
Tighten your grip, Rabban.

421
00:48:59,426 --> 00:49:01,341
Uncle.

422
00:49:01,515 --> 00:49:03,865
Or feel mine on your neck.

423
00:49:19,533 --> 00:49:21,578
Usul? Usul.

424
00:49:21,752 --> 00:49:24,451
It's okay. It's okay.

425
00:49:27,845 --> 00:49:28,672
Hey.

426
00:49:31,632 --> 00:49:34,635
I'm here, I'm here.

427
00:49:34,809 --> 00:49:37,725
It's been a while since you've
had one of those nightmares.

428
00:49:37,899 --> 00:49:38,856
Mm.

429
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:44,862
Tell me, what was it about?

430
00:49:50,999 --> 00:49:53,959
Nothing's clear.
It's only fragments.

431
00:49:56,178 --> 00:50:00,008
I'm in the South,
and I'm following someone.

432
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:03,403
And it triggers a holy war.

433
00:50:07,059 --> 00:50:10,627
Millions and millions of people
starving to death...

434
00:50:12,064 --> 00:50:13,239
because of me.

435
00:50:19,201 --> 00:50:22,204
You've been exposed
to spice for a long time.

436
00:50:22,378 --> 00:50:24,337
It can create weird dreams.

437
00:50:31,518 --> 00:50:32,301
It's a big day.

438
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:36,047
We can ask Stilgar to call it off.

439
00:50:36,131 --> 00:50:38,699
No. I'm fine.

440
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:55,672
Usul.

441
00:50:58,501 --> 00:51:00,373
I tuned it myself.

442
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:03,854
Here.
Thanks.

443
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:10,383
Don't try to impress anyone.
You are brave. We all know that.

444
00:51:11,384 --> 00:51:13,734
Heh? Be simple.

445
00:51:13,908 --> 00:51:17,042
Be direct. Nothing fancy.

446
00:51:17,216 --> 00:51:19,261
- Nothing fancy.
- Hey, I'm serious.

447
00:51:19,435 --> 00:51:21,872
Nothing fancy or you will shame
my teaching.

448
00:51:22,047 --> 00:51:26,007
I won't shame you.
I understand.

449
00:51:26,181 --> 00:51:30,620
Shai-Hulud decides today if you
become Fremen, or if you die.

450
00:51:38,715 --> 00:51:40,413
Hey, Muad'Dib!

451
00:51:40,587 --> 00:51:42,763
Don't embarrass us!
Call a big one!

452
00:51:47,985 --> 00:51:50,292
Don't worry.
Stilgar taught him well.

453
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:57,212
Enough joking.

454
00:51:57,386 --> 00:51:58,561
This is the final test.

455
00:52:21,628 --> 00:52:22,585
Lower.

456
00:52:47,001 --> 00:52:49,221
Okay. Okay.

457
00:53:50,369 --> 00:53:53,023
Whoa! Not that big.

458
00:54:01,075 --> 00:54:05,471
Okay. Okay. Okay.

459
00:54:53,214 --> 00:54:54,259
Okay.

460
00:55:11,798 --> 00:55:13,060
Okay. Okay!

461
00:55:38,041 --> 00:55:39,086
Come on!

462
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:50,880
Whoa!

463
00:56:54,422 --> 00:56:55,510
You're a rider!

464
00:57:17,314 --> 00:57:19,621
As written.

465
00:57:58,921 --> 00:58:01,881
Reverend Mother!

466
00:58:04,187 --> 00:58:08,757
Muad'Dib made peace with Shai-Hulud.

467
00:58:11,673 --> 00:58:13,806
He called a grandfather worm,

468
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:17,287
the biggest ever seen.

469
00:58:17,462 --> 00:58:19,376
As written!

470
00:58:19,551 --> 00:58:22,554
Shai-Hulud shall bow to the
Boy from the Outer World.

471
00:58:22,728 --> 00:58:26,035
Bless the Maker and His works.

472
00:58:26,209 --> 00:58:30,083
Will not Shai-Hulud know
the Mahdi when He comes?

473
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:36,655
Then share the Word.

474
00:58:51,234 --> 00:58:53,585
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm. I know they do.

475
00:58:56,588 --> 00:58:59,025
Our task in the North is nearly done.

476
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:00,809
They believe in Paul.

477
00:59:01,897 --> 00:59:04,073
Now we go South.

478
00:59:04,247 --> 00:59:07,729
There are millions
of fundamentalists there.

479
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:10,253
They will protect him when he comes.

480
00:59:12,908 --> 00:59:17,043
The Kwisatz Haderach
will be born in the South.

481
00:59:25,486 --> 00:59:27,183
Will you always be with me?

482
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,754
As long as I breathe.

483
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:38,281
What's wrong?

484
00:59:44,374 --> 00:59:45,245
Chani.

485
00:59:45,419 --> 00:59:46,812
There will be trouble.

486
00:59:49,075 --> 00:59:50,425
What are you talking about?

487
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:55,560
Chani, what do you mean?

488
00:59:55,734 --> 00:59:57,126
The way they look at you.

489
00:59:58,606 --> 00:59:59,912
They worship you now.

490
01:00:02,871 --> 01:00:05,308
The Fedaykin, they count your victories.

491
01:00:05,482 --> 01:00:07,833
They say you can see the future.

492
01:00:08,007 --> 01:00:09,661
Whisper, "Lisan al-Gaib."

493
01:00:11,053 --> 01:00:12,446
I'm no messiah.

494
01:00:15,188 --> 01:00:18,278
I'm a Fedaykin of Sietch Tabr.

495
01:00:18,452 --> 01:00:20,933
Yet, we have a Bene Gesserit among us,

496
01:00:21,107 --> 01:00:22,459
fanning the flames of your legend,

497
01:00:22,543 --> 01:00:23,936
saying you're the One.

498
01:00:45,522 --> 01:00:47,089
Mm.

499
01:00:47,263 --> 01:00:48,438
Reverend Mother!

500
01:00:48,613 --> 01:00:51,354
Your palanquin is ready!

501
01:00:51,528 --> 01:00:53,378
She says you should be coming with us.

502
01:00:54,183 --> 01:00:55,184
You know I can't.

503
01:00:56,098 --> 01:00:57,534
She's asking why.

504
01:00:57,709 --> 01:00:59,627
Because I must continue
fighting in the North,

505
01:00:59,711 --> 01:01:01,626
to protect you down there in the South.

506
01:01:03,671 --> 01:01:07,109
She says she can tell when you lie.

507
01:01:07,283 --> 01:01:10,591
Tell her that's because our mother
keeps spreading dangerous tales.

508
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:19,731
What is she saying now?

509
01:01:19,905 --> 01:01:22,298
She says you're blinded by love,

510
01:01:22,472 --> 01:01:24,652
and she reminds you that
you must reserve your hand

511
01:01:24,736 --> 01:01:26,476
for the most strategic alliance.

512
01:01:29,610 --> 01:01:32,410
She's also wondering why you
don't believe in who you are.

513
01:01:32,526 --> 01:01:33,701
I do believe.

514
01:01:33,875 --> 01:01:35,660
I believe I matter to these people.

515
01:01:37,487 --> 01:01:39,937
And I believe I'm making
a difference in this war.

516
01:01:41,535 --> 01:01:43,192
We're nearly at the gates of the city.

517
01:01:43,276 --> 01:01:45,974
- That's not what she means.
- I know what she means.

518
01:01:46,148 --> 01:01:48,458
Do you not think I also feel
the weight of the prophecy?

519
01:01:48,542 --> 01:01:50,413
It's not a prophecy.

520
01:01:50,587 --> 01:01:52,157
It's a story that you keep telling,

521
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:54,156
but it's not their story, it's yours.

522
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:57,464
They deserve to be led
by one of their own.

523
01:01:57,638 --> 01:02:00,188
What your people did
to this world is heartbreaking.

524
01:02:00,293 --> 01:02:01,819
We gave them something to hope for.

525
01:02:01,903 --> 01:02:03,513
That's not hope!

526
01:02:08,736 --> 01:02:10,956
Reverend Mother, we have to go!

527
01:02:17,789 --> 01:02:19,094
I'll be waiting for you.

528
01:02:20,705 --> 01:02:21,880
All of us.

529
01:02:22,054 --> 01:02:23,838
All of us.

530
01:03:05,445 --> 01:03:07,882
Those storms look bad.

531
01:03:08,056 --> 01:03:10,058
They're the Guardians of the South.

532
01:03:10,232 --> 01:03:14,410
It's a hard crossing,
but Shai-Hulud is strong.

533
01:03:55,103 --> 01:03:56,757
How much?
We lost...

534
01:03:56,931 --> 01:03:59,412
80 percent of our last crop.

535
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:03,285
My Lord Rabban, you should not
leave the security perimeter.

536
01:04:03,459 --> 01:04:05,810
Security perimeter?
The rats are already inside.

537
01:04:05,984 --> 01:04:07,734
The Fremen Demon might be with them.

538
01:04:07,768 --> 01:04:09,335
I hope so.

539
01:04:09,509 --> 01:04:10,959
We're tracking them, my Lord.

540
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:13,948
Today, Muad'Dib dies!

541
01:04:17,691 --> 01:04:22,130
The rats are traveling fast.

542
01:04:22,304 --> 01:04:24,176
Move!

543
01:04:55,729 --> 01:04:57,165
Where is he?

544
01:04:57,339 --> 01:04:58,819
Still negative, my Lord.

545
01:04:58,993 --> 01:05:00,843
Why do I have to do everything myself?

546
01:05:03,563 --> 01:05:04,564
Open range!

547
01:05:04,738 --> 01:05:06,000
Range open.

548
01:05:14,008 --> 01:05:15,662
Life. Delta, delta, delta.

549
01:05:36,988 --> 01:05:38,032
I've lost them.

550
01:05:43,646 --> 01:05:45,344
Strike!
Yes, my Lord.

551
01:06:52,063 --> 01:06:54,717
Muad'Dib!

552
01:06:54,891 --> 01:06:56,719
Show yourself!

553
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:31,624
Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib!

554
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:26,722
For Muad'Dib!

555
01:08:39,431 --> 01:08:40,432
Muad'Dib.

556
01:08:42,956 --> 01:08:46,873
Some new Fremen prophet?

557
01:08:47,047 --> 01:08:49,835
It's not the first time we've
had frictions with the Fremen.

558
01:08:49,919 --> 01:08:51,617
None of this magnitude.

559
01:08:55,925 --> 01:08:57,362
So, my dear daughter...

560
01:08:58,754 --> 01:09:00,974
how would you deal with this prophet?

561
01:09:07,285 --> 01:09:10,070
If this Muad'Dib is a religious figure,

562
01:09:11,767 --> 01:09:13,421
you can't use direct force.

563
01:09:15,119 --> 01:09:18,296
Repression only makes a religion flourish.

564
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:20,420
You'll only end up humiliating yourself.

565
01:09:20,559 --> 01:09:22,126
You underestimate my Sardaukar.

566
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:25,085
You underestimate the power of faith.

567
01:09:29,045 --> 01:09:32,397
Her Highness proves once again that
she was my most acute student.

568
01:09:34,790 --> 01:09:37,489
You'd send assassins?
No.

569
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:39,413
Prophets get stronger when they die.

570
01:09:41,232 --> 01:09:43,582
Let the conflict on Arrakis turn into war.

571
01:09:43,756 --> 01:09:46,933
You then bring peace.
As a savior.

572
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:51,242
You'd be a formidable empress.

573
01:09:55,724 --> 01:09:58,510
Muad'Dib. The prophet.

574
01:09:58,684 --> 01:10:01,165
The one who points the way.

575
01:10:01,339 --> 01:10:03,474
These are our own religious
patterns, aren't they?

576
01:10:03,558 --> 01:10:04,864
This is our doing.

577
01:10:08,476 --> 01:10:11,392
Muad'Dib means kangaroo mouse.

578
01:10:11,566 --> 01:10:13,394
An unusual war name for a Fremen.

579
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:18,747
What if Paul Atreides were
still alive? Enough!

580
01:10:18,921 --> 01:10:23,012
This must not come out. Even to
your father's ears. Understand?

581
01:10:24,013 --> 01:10:26,799
I do, Reverend Mother.

582
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:30,106
If Paul is alive,
he likely knows the truth.

583
01:10:30,281 --> 01:10:32,108
And should the Great Houses learn

584
01:10:32,283 --> 01:10:35,286
that your father was behind the
liquidation of the Atreides,

585
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:38,811
your father will face war
and lose the throne.

586
01:10:40,813 --> 01:10:42,206
Then what hope is there?

587
01:10:43,642 --> 01:10:44,425
Hope?

588
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:50,214
We are Bene Gesserit.
We don't hope, we plan.

589
01:10:51,432 --> 01:10:55,349
Paul is not our only prospect.

590
01:10:55,523 --> 01:11:00,398
The Baron's youngest nephew,
Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, will inherit Arrakis.

591
01:11:02,138 --> 01:11:03,401
He may be the answer.

592
01:11:03,575 --> 01:11:06,099
Feyd-Rautha? He's psychotic.

593
01:11:06,273 --> 01:11:08,101
That's irrelevant.

594
01:11:08,275 --> 01:11:12,279
The question is, can we control him?

595
01:11:12,453 --> 01:11:13,933
And I intend to find out.

596
01:11:37,391 --> 01:11:39,741
Would you like some fresh meat,
my darlings?

597
01:11:40,873 --> 01:11:43,963
Lungs? Or liver?

598
01:11:44,137 --> 01:11:47,053
What would you like?
I hear they're big today.

599
01:11:47,227 --> 01:11:51,405
Your new blades for this very special day,

600
01:11:51,579 --> 01:11:54,321
na-Baron, Feyd-Rautha.

601
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:24,822
A notch off balance.

602
01:12:24,917 --> 01:12:25,567
It's the tip.

603
01:12:26,614 --> 01:12:28,050
Should be sharper.

604
01:12:42,413 --> 01:12:43,805
Come.

605
01:12:43,979 --> 01:12:45,851
I won't die like a fool.

606
01:12:46,025 --> 01:12:47,243
Kill me now.

607
01:12:47,418 --> 01:12:49,942
No drug for you today,
Atreides.

608
01:12:54,686 --> 01:12:57,079
Under our glorious black sun,

609
01:12:57,253 --> 01:13:01,170
we welcome to these special festivities

610
01:13:01,345 --> 01:13:03,521
our beloved leader
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.

611
01:13:14,793 --> 01:13:19,014
His presence today, watching over

612
01:13:19,188 --> 01:13:21,495
a spectacle of blood and honor

613
01:13:21,669 --> 01:13:23,845
marks the Holy Birthday...

614
01:13:24,019 --> 01:13:28,284
...of our beloved na-Baron, Feyd-Rautha.

615
01:14:05,452 --> 01:14:07,323
Welcome to Giedi Prime, sisters.

616
01:14:07,498 --> 01:14:09,500
I hope your travels were agreeable.

617
01:14:09,674 --> 01:14:11,874
A long way to come
just to watch our prospect

618
01:14:11,937 --> 01:14:13,721
risk his life, Lady Fenring.

619
01:14:13,895 --> 01:14:15,810
No fear.

620
01:14:15,984 --> 01:14:17,551
These fights are all for show.

621
01:14:19,205 --> 01:14:21,599
But we'll get a good look at him.

622
01:14:43,795 --> 01:14:47,581
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

623
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,920
In celebration
of our na-Baron, Feyd-Rautha,

624
01:15:22,094 --> 01:15:25,837
we present a special treat...

625
01:15:30,624 --> 01:15:36,500
the last three specimens
of House Atreides.

626
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:03,290
That slave isn't drugged.

627
01:16:04,179 --> 01:16:05,790
That bug is walking straight.

628
01:16:07,182 --> 01:16:08,491
You should cancel the fight.

629
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:11,186
Don't spoil my nephew's birthday.

630
01:16:58,799 --> 01:17:01,541
Happy birthday, dear nephew.

631
01:17:18,253 --> 01:17:20,038
Why do they not stop the fight?

632
01:17:20,212 --> 01:17:21,909
Plans within plans.

633
01:17:26,784 --> 01:17:28,263
Show me who you are.

634
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:46,673
There he is.

635
01:18:31,413 --> 01:18:33,154
Back! Back!

636
01:18:50,998 --> 01:18:52,173
Stay back!

637
01:19:06,057 --> 01:19:08,276
You have fought well, Atreides.

638
01:19:09,408 --> 01:19:10,801
Hmm.

639
01:19:20,071 --> 01:19:24,423
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

640
01:19:29,994 --> 01:19:31,386
He's impressive, indeed.

641
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:35,303
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

642
01:19:43,311 --> 01:19:44,791
The slave wasn't drugged.

643
01:19:47,315 --> 01:19:49,753
You tried to kill me.

644
01:19:49,927 --> 01:19:52,233
This morning you were a playboy,

645
01:19:52,407 --> 01:19:54,148
feared and envied,

646
01:19:54,322 --> 01:19:57,543
but tonight you're a hero.

647
01:19:57,717 --> 01:19:59,284
My gift to you.

648
01:19:59,458 --> 01:20:01,329
I ought to drown you in that tub.

649
01:20:02,896 --> 01:20:05,029
Don't be hasty.

650
01:20:05,203 --> 01:20:07,596
I have another gift for you.

651
01:20:07,771 --> 01:20:08,946
A bigger one.

652
01:20:10,599 --> 01:20:12,210
Arrakis.

653
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:17,781
What about Rabban?

654
01:20:17,955 --> 01:20:20,131
He has failed to protect spice production.

655
01:20:20,305 --> 01:20:22,481
Rabban will be reassigned.

656
01:20:26,485 --> 01:20:29,227
Tame Arrakis, Feyd.

657
01:20:29,401 --> 01:20:31,838
Free the spice.
I'll make you Emperor.

658
01:20:44,285 --> 01:20:46,026
Emperor?

659
01:20:49,334 --> 01:20:50,248
How?

660
01:20:52,467 --> 01:20:55,340
The Emperor helped me
destroy the Atreides.

661
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:59,344
He lent his own army to the cause.

662
01:20:59,518 --> 01:21:01,868
A serious crime.

663
01:21:02,042 --> 01:21:06,220
If it came to light, the Great
Houses would rise against him.

664
01:21:07,047 --> 01:21:08,266
And then...

665
01:21:09,658 --> 01:21:11,878
who will sit on the throne?

666
01:21:12,879 --> 01:21:15,882
Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen.

667
01:21:56,227 --> 01:21:57,358
You're following me.

668
01:21:58,838 --> 01:21:59,883
Am I?

669
01:22:01,841 --> 01:22:03,234
I may have gotten lost.

670
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:10,067
Will you show me the way out of
this maze, my Lord na-Baron?

671
01:22:17,422 --> 01:22:19,598
We've met, haven't we?

672
01:22:22,949 --> 01:22:24,037
I don't think so.

673
01:22:25,038 --> 01:22:27,432
I'm Lady Margot Fenring.

674
01:22:27,606 --> 01:22:29,869
I'm here to honor your coming of age.

675
01:22:30,043 --> 01:22:31,743
You're not allowed in this section.

676
01:22:32,916 --> 01:22:34,355
How did you get past the guards?

677
01:22:34,439 --> 01:22:35,657
The guards?

678
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:40,488
May I ask, what are you doing here?

679
01:22:42,882 --> 01:22:46,103
You're not taking part
in your own celebrations?

680
01:22:56,591 --> 01:22:59,290
You're Bene Gesserit.

681
01:22:59,464 --> 01:23:02,119
And what makes you say that?

682
01:23:02,293 --> 01:23:04,773
I remember now.

683
01:23:04,948 --> 01:23:07,472
I dreamed about you last night.

684
01:23:07,646 --> 01:23:09,126
A pleasant dream,
I hope.

685
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:10,779
Don't mock me, woman.

686
01:23:10,954 --> 01:23:12,042
I wouldn't dare.

687
01:23:14,522 --> 01:23:17,395
I know your
Bene Gesserit tricks.

688
01:23:17,569 --> 01:23:19,875
And what do you know
about the Bene Gesserit?

689
01:23:23,749 --> 01:23:24,576
Tell me.

690
01:23:28,884 --> 01:23:30,364
Something wrong?

691
01:23:30,538 --> 01:23:31,988
I don't recognize this place.

692
01:23:33,063 --> 01:23:34,542
This is the guest wing.

693
01:23:37,502 --> 01:23:38,590
Where are you going?

694
01:23:40,505 --> 01:23:41,419
To my room.

695
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:14,017
Come. To. Me.

696
01:24:17,455 --> 01:24:18,543
Kneel.

697
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:35,560
Put your right hand in the box.

698
01:24:50,923 --> 01:24:54,013
A sociopath.
Of high intelligence.

699
01:24:54,187 --> 01:24:56,102
Driven. Cruel.

700
01:24:56,276 --> 01:24:58,278
But strongly motivated by honor.

701
01:24:59,497 --> 01:25:01,542
He yearns to be hurt.

702
01:25:01,716 --> 01:25:03,501
He loves pain.

703
01:25:03,675 --> 01:25:05,111
Can he be redeemed?

704
01:25:05,285 --> 01:25:06,678
He can be controlled.

705
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:08,506
He's sexually vulnerable.

706
01:25:10,725 --> 01:25:11,552
And?

707
01:25:13,163 --> 01:25:14,729
The bloodline is secured.

708
01:25:16,470 --> 01:25:19,212
Female, as you requested.

709
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:22,607
You did well, Margot.

710
01:25:22,781 --> 01:25:26,001
Respectfully, why didn't you
test him yourself?

711
01:25:27,351 --> 01:25:29,788
I'm a motherly figure.

712
01:25:29,962 --> 01:25:33,313
And based on what happened
between him and his own mother,

713
01:25:33,487 --> 01:25:36,055
I didn't expect to be effective.

714
01:25:36,229 --> 01:25:38,229
What happened between him and his mother?

715
01:25:38,449 --> 01:25:39,249
He murdered her.

716
01:25:40,842 --> 01:25:43,758
Desire and humiliation.

717
01:25:45,108 --> 01:25:47,501
Those are his levers.

718
01:25:47,675 --> 01:25:50,025
If Feyd-Rautha prevails on Arrakis,

719
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:52,767
we shall know how to control him.

720
01:26:05,345 --> 01:26:09,044
All hail na-Baron Feyd-Rautha!

721
01:26:09,219 --> 01:26:11,873
The new Planetary
Governor of Arrakis.

722
01:26:13,658 --> 01:26:15,877
Rid me of this Fremen Demon.

723
01:26:31,110 --> 01:26:34,461
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

724
01:26:34,635 --> 01:26:38,857
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

725
01:26:39,031 --> 01:26:40,598
Feyd-Rautha!

We're in.

733
01:27:28,733 --> 01:27:29,908
Juicy?

734
01:27:30,082 --> 01:27:31,736
Juicy, juicy.

735
01:27:34,521 --> 01:27:36,088
Well, it was nice knowing ya.

736
01:27:36,262 --> 01:27:37,524
Oh, yeah?

737
01:27:37,698 --> 01:27:39,309
Radar's clear. We're clear.

738
01:27:40,875 --> 01:27:42,225
Cooking time.

739
01:28:02,245 --> 01:28:03,855
Juicy, juicy.

740
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:05,944
Yeah, I got a meter reading--

741
01:28:06,118 --> 01:28:08,068
All right, guys, worms are on their way.

742
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:09,124
Watch out for abrasions.
Get ready to dock.

743
01:28:09,208 --> 01:28:10,340
It's gonna get hot.

744
01:28:14,561 --> 01:28:16,346
Crank 'em up!
Throw them up!

745
01:28:45,375 --> 01:28:46,289
Hold!

746
01:29:00,738 --> 01:29:02,043
Mine! Mine!

747
01:29:02,217 --> 01:29:03,784
Get moving!

748
01:29:07,962 --> 01:29:10,225
East! East!
Get clear!

749
01:29:16,797 --> 01:29:18,582
Let's get out of here!

750
01:29:18,756 --> 01:29:20,192
Incoming!

751
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,284
Don't run, fight!

752
01:29:27,068 --> 01:29:28,983
We're in deep
Fremen shit.

753
01:29:31,072 --> 01:29:32,335
Holy Mother.

754
01:29:43,694 --> 01:29:44,738
Oh, fuck.

755
01:30:01,842 --> 01:30:04,497
I recognized your footsteps...

756
01:30:04,671 --> 01:30:06,238
old man.
No.

757
01:30:30,610 --> 01:30:32,699
You young pup.

758
01:30:33,439 --> 01:30:35,180
You young pup!

759
01:30:42,405 --> 01:30:44,972
Mmm.
After the Battle of Arrakeen,

760
01:30:45,146 --> 01:30:48,411
I was able to negotiate a trip
back home for the survivors.

761
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:51,675
Thanks to these guys.

762
01:30:51,849 --> 01:30:53,067
Why'd you stay?

763
01:30:54,155 --> 01:30:55,418
Well, I wanted blood.

764
01:30:57,724 --> 01:30:58,812
Rabban's head?

765
01:30:59,987 --> 01:31:01,902
Mm-hmm.

766
01:31:02,076 --> 01:31:05,036
Well, since Muad'Dib's
been driving Rabban crazy,

767
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:09,910
the smuggling business
has been quite profitable.

768
01:31:10,084 --> 01:31:11,782
Gurney Halleck the smuggler.

769
01:31:14,045 --> 01:31:16,351
Paul Muad'Dib.

770
01:31:16,526 --> 01:31:19,093
I've heard many stories about Muad'Dib.

771
01:31:20,268 --> 01:31:21,661
None of them pretty.

772
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:24,359
You see the fear?

773
01:31:26,144 --> 01:31:27,885
When our resources are limited...

774
01:31:30,670 --> 01:31:32,280
fear is all we have.

775
01:31:49,950 --> 01:31:51,430
How many men with you?

776
01:31:51,604 --> 01:31:53,432
- Two hundred.
- Two hundred?

777
01:31:58,306 --> 01:32:01,179
Do you realize what you're able
to achieve with 200 men?

778
01:32:02,572 --> 01:32:04,138
Incredible fighters.

779
01:32:04,312 --> 01:32:05,665
Duncan said there were millions of them.

780
01:32:05,749 --> 01:32:07,402
In the Deep South, yes.

781
01:32:07,577 --> 01:32:09,753
Well, what are you waiting for?

782
01:32:09,927 --> 01:32:13,107
With thousands of these guys,
you could take control of the entire planet.

783
01:32:13,191 --> 01:32:15,196
It's your father's dream.
What are you afraid of?

784
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:16,237
Hey!

785
01:32:18,370 --> 01:32:19,980
Worship, Gurney.

786
01:32:21,373 --> 01:32:22,573
They used to be friends.

787
01:32:24,376 --> 01:32:25,508
Now they're followers.

788
01:32:25,682 --> 01:32:27,640
Muad'Dib, the Prophet.

789
01:32:27,814 --> 01:32:29,599
Why is that a bad thing?
Use it.

790
01:32:29,773 --> 01:32:31,905
It's not that simple.

791
01:32:32,079 --> 01:32:34,694
You have the power to avenge your father,
and you're afraid to use it?

792
01:32:34,778 --> 01:32:36,736
Spice opened my mind, Gurney.

793
01:32:37,737 --> 01:32:39,130
I can foresee things.

794
01:32:41,175 --> 01:32:45,005
If I go South, all my visions
lead to horror.

795
01:32:45,179 --> 01:32:48,356
Billions of corpses
scattered across the galaxy.

796
01:32:48,531 --> 01:32:49,880
All dying because of me.

797
01:32:50,968 --> 01:32:52,218
Because you lose control.

798
01:32:54,232 --> 01:32:55,276
Because I gain it.

799
01:33:14,165 --> 01:33:15,340
That's a lot of water.

800
01:33:18,082 --> 01:33:19,518
Chani.

801
01:33:19,692 --> 01:33:21,292
What?
Look at him, he's hopeless.

802
01:33:21,999 --> 01:33:22,869
He's family.

803
01:33:26,481 --> 01:33:27,482
Really?

804
01:33:38,189 --> 01:33:39,839
What do you think of the outsider?

805
01:33:42,454 --> 01:33:43,760
I think he's trouble.

806
01:33:46,589 --> 01:33:48,155
No, I trust Usul.

807
01:33:55,989 --> 01:33:58,089
No need to be a prophet
to see what's ahead.

808
01:34:00,864 --> 01:34:02,256
Your path leads to war.

809
01:34:03,997 --> 01:34:05,042
You know that.

810
01:34:07,566 --> 01:34:09,699
So, war is coming.

811
01:34:09,873 --> 01:34:13,398
What will you do when you feel
its breath upon your neck?

812
01:34:17,271 --> 01:34:19,621
If you don't want to raise
an army in the South,

813
01:34:19,622 --> 01:34:21,101
you may still have an option.

814
01:34:24,539 --> 01:34:25,584
Fire power...

815
01:34:27,281 --> 01:34:28,805
which you don't have.

816
01:34:31,068 --> 01:34:31,982
And here I am.

817
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:38,989
I know where your father
hid the family atomics.

818
01:34:44,559 --> 01:34:47,258
Every House possesses an atomic arsenal.

819
01:34:48,738 --> 01:34:50,653
I thought ours had been lost.

820
01:34:53,046 --> 01:34:55,440
It's huge, Chani.
It could change everything.

821
01:35:00,837 --> 01:35:03,970
I could aim the bombs
at the main spice fields.

822
01:35:06,016 --> 01:35:09,193
He who can destroy a thing
has the real control of it.

823
01:35:10,934 --> 01:35:12,584
So, you can control it and not us?

824
01:35:14,807 --> 01:35:16,657
You promised me you didn't want power.

825
01:35:18,419 --> 01:35:20,381
No matter what I do,
you still don't trust me.

826
01:35:20,465 --> 01:35:23,120
'Cause you're a foreigner.
Like your friend.

827
01:35:25,557 --> 01:35:27,037
I'm not a foreigner.

828
01:35:34,827 --> 01:35:36,046
Not to me.

829
01:35:36,220 --> 01:35:37,743
But to the desert, you are.

830
01:35:38,918 --> 01:35:40,877
My allegiance is to you.

831
01:35:41,747 --> 01:35:42,879
To the Fremen.

832
01:35:43,053 --> 01:35:44,750
I'm doing this for all of us.

833
01:35:46,404 --> 01:35:47,304
Do you believe me?

834
01:35:55,892 --> 01:35:56,942
I'll talk to Stilgar.

835
01:36:05,118 --> 01:36:06,076
There.

836
01:36:10,428 --> 01:36:13,648
It's right under everybody's noses.

837
01:36:14,998 --> 01:36:16,216
Not clever.

838
01:36:16,390 --> 01:36:18,001
That's the idea.

839
01:36:18,175 --> 01:36:20,775
Nobody would ever look in there
because it's obvious.

840
01:36:22,962 --> 01:36:24,790
Not clever.

841
01:36:24,964 --> 01:36:26,444
Did you find it?

842
01:36:26,618 --> 01:36:28,663
I didn't look for it.

843
01:36:28,838 --> 01:36:30,143
How many heads exactly?

844
01:36:32,058 --> 01:36:33,886
Enough to blow up the whole planet.

845
01:36:37,020 --> 01:36:38,456
It's a figure of speech.

846
01:36:40,371 --> 01:36:41,421
You know what I mean.

847
01:37:04,177 --> 01:37:05,962
Only with your genetic heritage.

848
01:37:45,871 --> 01:37:49,396
Your great-great-grandfather's legacy.

849
01:37:49,570 --> 01:37:53,096
The 92 original Atreides
family's atomic warheads.

850
01:37:56,055 --> 01:37:59,232
Now that, that is power.

851
01:38:06,152 --> 01:38:10,243
Imperial Diary. Year 10,191.

852
01:38:10,417 --> 01:38:12,637
Eighth comment.

853
01:38:12,811 --> 01:38:16,554
Reports from the south of
Arrakis arrive rarely.

854
01:38:16,728 --> 01:38:20,210
These are barren, burnt lands
hidden by sandstorms

855
01:38:20,384 --> 01:38:22,834
which stretch a thousand miles
across the equator.

856
01:38:24,692 --> 01:38:28,522
Nothing can live there without faith.

857
01:38:28,696 --> 01:38:32,700
Which is why our Bene Gesserit missionaries
have been so productive there.

858
01:38:36,182 --> 01:38:39,132
Through them, we are receiving
reports of a mysterious figure

859
01:38:39,185 --> 01:38:40,883
taking grip on the imaginations

860
01:38:41,057 --> 01:38:44,364
of the Southern fundamentalist tribes.

861
01:38:44,538 --> 01:38:47,977
A new Reverend Mother from the North...

862
01:38:48,151 --> 01:38:52,111
spreading word of the imminent
arrival of the Lisan al-Gaib,

863
01:38:52,285 --> 01:38:55,288
"The Voice from the Outer World."

864
01:38:55,462 --> 01:38:58,683
With religious fervor rising in the South,

865
01:38:58,857 --> 01:39:02,469
and Muad'Dib strangling spice
production in the North,

866
01:39:02,643 --> 01:39:05,908
everything points
to the escalation of war.

867
01:39:13,132 --> 01:39:15,743
Only one at a time,

868
01:39:15,918 --> 01:39:19,530
or they fight each other to death.

869
01:39:21,271 --> 01:39:23,838
- How old?
- Very young.

870
01:39:25,884 --> 01:39:26,711
Hmm.

871
01:39:28,713 --> 01:39:30,584
My daughter asks, how is it done?

872
01:39:36,460 --> 01:39:37,243
Quiet.

873
01:41:19,606 --> 01:41:23,001
The Water of Life.

874
01:41:26,309 --> 01:41:27,962
Listen carefully.

875
01:41:28,137 --> 01:41:29,706
Soon a man is going to visit your temple

876
01:41:29,790 --> 01:41:32,315
and he may want you to perform the rites.

877
01:41:32,489 --> 01:41:35,318
Reverend Mother, it is forbidden.

878
01:41:35,492 --> 01:41:37,537
You question the prophecy?

879
01:41:37,711 --> 01:41:40,671
No man will survive.

880
01:41:40,845 --> 01:41:42,586
Let him try!

881
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:27,935
What the hell?

882
01:42:31,461 --> 01:42:32,723
Chani!

883
01:42:38,729 --> 01:42:40,078
Chani!

884
01:42:44,169 --> 01:42:45,127
Chani.

885
01:42:55,093 --> 01:42:56,616
Sietch Tabr.

886
01:43:21,119 --> 01:43:22,686
Old-fashioned artillery.

887
01:43:23,861 --> 01:43:25,689
Genius.

888
01:43:25,863 --> 01:43:28,561
We're literally melting rock
on their heads.

889
01:43:28,735 --> 01:43:31,651
I want to go on the ground.
Prepare my troops.

890
01:43:31,825 --> 01:43:34,872
My Lord. I would recommend you
stay inside. There was--

891
01:43:35,046 --> 01:43:36,787
Bring his body to my quarters.

892
01:43:38,180 --> 01:43:40,225
My poor darlings are hungry.

893
01:43:40,399 --> 01:43:42,399
There was no food for them on the flight.

894
01:43:43,707 --> 01:43:46,144
What are you doing here?

895
01:43:46,318 --> 01:43:49,191
It's early morning.
What are you doing here?

896
01:43:49,365 --> 01:43:51,062
Kiss my feet, brother.

897
01:43:51,236 --> 01:43:52,586
I'm gonna eviscerate your--

898
01:43:58,374 --> 01:44:00,898
You humiliated our family.

899
01:44:02,073 --> 01:44:03,770
You humiliated me.

900
01:44:04,771 --> 01:44:06,164
Kiss...

901
01:44:06,338 --> 01:44:08,035
...or die.

902
01:44:18,394 --> 01:44:19,482
We're even now.

903
01:44:25,792 --> 01:44:28,230
Embarrass our family one more time...

904
01:44:29,622 --> 01:44:30,797
it will be the last.

905
01:45:00,610 --> 01:45:03,569
They're all dead!

906
01:45:03,743 --> 01:45:05,658
I lost them all in the fire.

907
01:45:05,832 --> 01:45:08,182
They didn't even engage on the ground,

908
01:45:08,357 --> 01:45:10,446
like honorable fighters.

909
01:45:12,796 --> 01:45:14,928
The whole of the North has been hit.

910
01:45:19,106 --> 01:45:21,892
There is a call for a war
council in the South.

911
01:45:22,066 --> 01:45:23,763
Every leader must attend.

912
01:45:25,461 --> 01:45:27,463
Muad'Dib, they're waiting for you.

913
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,916
Usul, in the South...

914
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:48,397
only leaders are allowed to speak.

915
01:45:49,833 --> 01:45:52,575
- You must take my place.
- I can't do that.

916
01:45:52,749 --> 01:45:55,491
It is a good time to cross blades with me.

917
01:45:55,665 --> 01:45:58,885
I am weak.
I am an easy kill, Muad'Dib.

918
01:45:59,059 --> 01:46:01,061
I'd rather cut off my own hand.

919
01:46:01,235 --> 01:46:03,719
We need you. We need the Lisan
al-Gaib to lead our people.

920
01:46:03,803 --> 01:46:05,678
You know what I think
of all that, Stilgar.

921
01:46:05,762 --> 01:46:08,199
I don't care what you believe.
I believe.

922
01:46:22,692 --> 01:46:23,997
I didn't see it coming.

923
01:46:25,912 --> 01:46:27,523
The Harkonnens aren't done here.

924
01:46:28,698 --> 01:46:30,743
They just went back to reload.

925
01:46:30,917 --> 01:46:32,615
We're setting thumpers.

926
01:46:32,789 --> 01:46:34,184
We're moving everyone to the South.

927
01:46:34,268 --> 01:46:36,099
I'll stay behind and cover your retreat.

928
01:46:36,183 --> 01:46:39,083
- What are you talking about?
- Chani, I can't go with you.

929
01:46:39,273 --> 01:46:40,710
You know why.

930
01:46:40,884 --> 01:46:42,755
- I'll stay too.
- Nobody stays but me.

931
01:46:42,929 --> 01:46:45,329
- Paul.
- That's an order, Gurney Halleck! Go South!

932
01:46:45,454 --> 01:46:46,629
Protect my mother.

933
01:46:49,240 --> 01:46:51,111
My Lord.
Muad'Dib.

934
01:46:51,285 --> 01:46:52,725
None of these people
will leave without you.

935
01:46:52,809 --> 01:46:56,116
I can't go South.

936
01:47:00,469 --> 01:47:02,209
He's afraid of the fundamentalists.

937
01:47:03,646 --> 01:47:04,603
And he should be.

938
01:47:18,225 --> 01:47:19,401
Don't resist.

939
01:47:26,756 --> 01:47:28,322
Talk to me, Jamis.

940
01:47:39,203 --> 01:47:43,294
You see only fragments.

941
01:47:43,468 --> 01:47:47,341
You cannot see the future
without seeing the past.

942
01:47:49,648 --> 01:47:54,000
To unlock your mind, you need
to drink the Water of Life...

943
01:47:54,174 --> 01:47:57,047
and you will see everything.

944
01:48:00,877 --> 01:48:04,184
A good hunter always climbs the
highest dune before his hunt.

945
01:48:05,708 --> 01:48:06,883
He needs to see...

946
01:48:08,885 --> 01:48:10,452
as far as he can see.

947
01:48:15,718 --> 01:48:16,849
You need to see.

948
01:48:19,765 --> 01:48:21,724
You must drink the Water of Life.

949
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:24,727
Your mind, it's gonna open,

950
01:48:27,077 --> 01:48:28,644
and you will see.

951
01:48:47,184 --> 01:48:49,055
The world has made choices for us.

952
01:48:54,234 --> 01:48:55,801
If I go South,
I might lose you.

953
01:48:55,975 --> 01:48:57,629
You will never lose me,

954
01:48:59,065 --> 01:49:00,240
Paul Atreides.

955
01:49:02,155 --> 01:49:04,506
Not as long as you stay who you are.

956
01:49:12,035 --> 01:49:13,906
I'll cross the storms with you.

957
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:15,386
Go South.

958
01:49:16,648 --> 01:49:18,215
Bring your people to safety.

959
01:49:24,438 --> 01:49:27,006
And then I will do what must be done.

960
01:49:51,204 --> 01:49:52,292
Where?

961
01:49:52,466 --> 01:49:54,817
Spy. Left behind.

962
01:49:54,991 --> 01:49:56,819
No trace of the others.

963
01:49:56,993 --> 01:49:59,473
They've gone South to hide in the storms.

964
01:50:04,304 --> 01:50:05,828
Send this message to the Baron.

965
01:50:06,002 --> 01:50:08,265
The North is liberated and secured.

966
01:50:08,439 --> 01:50:10,702
Harvest spice at will.

967
01:50:10,876 --> 01:50:12,269
Yes, na-Baron.

968
01:50:27,023 --> 01:50:30,287
You killed nine of my men
with one single blade.

969
01:50:31,897 --> 01:50:33,595
She won't talk.

970
01:50:33,769 --> 01:50:35,597
Tell her that's fine.

971
01:50:35,771 --> 01:50:37,990
I already know everything I need to know.

972
01:50:46,042 --> 01:50:47,783
Only pleasure remains.

973
01:51:55,459 --> 01:51:58,723
You're not allowed in here, stranger.

974
01:51:58,897 --> 01:52:02,292
Leave or die.

975
01:52:02,466 --> 01:52:05,991
I should be welcomed.

976
01:52:08,951 --> 01:52:12,345
If you drink, you shall die.

977
01:52:13,695 --> 01:52:16,610
If you drink, you may see.

978
01:52:53,299 --> 01:52:57,086
Now that you can see our past,

979
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:03,527
you can see your future.

980
01:53:24,591 --> 01:53:28,291
Oh, brother, my dearest brother,

981
01:53:28,465 --> 01:53:31,163
you are not prepared for what is to come.

982
01:53:33,035 --> 01:53:36,255
You'll now learn the truth
about our family.

983
01:53:36,429 --> 01:53:39,824
And it will hurt you to the core.

984
01:53:41,521 --> 01:53:43,393
Paul...

985
01:53:43,567 --> 01:53:46,613
Don't worry. I'm with you.

986
01:53:48,050 --> 01:53:49,486
I love you.

987
01:53:53,707 --> 01:53:54,839
Who knows about this?

988
01:53:55,013 --> 01:53:56,313
Only you, Reverend Mother.

989
01:53:56,972 --> 01:53:58,408
Good.

990
01:53:58,582 --> 01:54:00,018
Where are the others?

991
01:54:00,192 --> 01:54:02,542
They just arrived from the North.

992
01:54:02,716 --> 01:54:03,892
Find them.

993
01:54:33,486 --> 01:54:34,444
Paul?

994
01:54:35,184 --> 01:54:36,185
Paul.

995
01:54:38,535 --> 01:54:40,885
I'm here. I'm here. Hey.

996
01:54:44,541 --> 01:54:45,847
What happened?

997
01:54:47,326 --> 01:54:48,675
What happened?

998
01:54:59,251 --> 01:55:00,818
He's dead.

999
01:55:00,992 --> 01:55:03,492
His vital signs are so low,
they can't be detected.

1000
01:55:03,647 --> 01:55:04,866
But he's alive.

1001
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:06,650
What did you do to him?

1002
01:55:08,043 --> 01:55:10,001
No, not that.
Why would he do that?

1003
01:55:10,175 --> 01:55:11,437
Why would you do that?

1004
01:55:11,611 --> 01:55:13,918
Because He is the One.

1005
01:55:14,092 --> 01:55:16,442
The Lisan al-Gaib should find His way

1006
01:55:16,616 --> 01:55:18,923
to where no man has ever been.

1007
01:55:19,097 --> 01:55:21,360
You're insane!

1008
01:55:21,534 --> 01:55:23,801
Chani, his body is fighting the
poison and he needs your help.

1009
01:55:23,885 --> 01:55:25,103
You do it.

1010
01:55:26,365 --> 01:55:27,366
You did this to him.

1011
01:55:27,540 --> 01:55:28,977
You did this to your own son!

1012
01:55:29,151 --> 01:55:30,108
You do it!

1013
01:55:30,282 --> 01:55:32,241
Fix it yourself.

1014
01:55:32,415 --> 01:55:35,815
Chani, you might not believe in the prophecy,
but you're a part of it.

1015
01:55:35,853 --> 01:55:37,333
You're the poison.

1016
01:55:37,507 --> 01:55:39,988
You and your lies.
Why would you do this?

1017
01:55:40,162 --> 01:55:41,337
Do it.

1018
01:55:51,477 --> 01:55:55,786
He shall come back from the dead

1019
01:55:55,960 --> 01:55:58,354
with Desert Spring tears.

1020
01:56:00,312 --> 01:56:02,619
Bring me a drop of Water of Life.

1021
01:56:03,402 --> 01:56:04,621
As written.

1022
01:56:06,362 --> 01:56:07,362
Desert Spring tears.

1023
01:56:31,691 --> 01:56:34,825
Kwisatz Haderach,

1024
01:56:34,999 --> 01:56:38,785
climb up. Arise.

1025
01:56:48,534 --> 01:56:50,232
Usul, I'm here. I'm here.

1026
01:56:59,719 --> 01:57:01,199
Are you okay?

1027
01:57:01,373 --> 01:57:02,331
Yes.

1028
01:57:11,514 --> 01:57:12,558
Are you sure?

1029
01:57:16,736 --> 01:57:17,999
Thanks to you.

1030
01:58:03,870 --> 01:58:05,307
I'm sorry about Chani.

1031
01:58:07,004 --> 01:58:08,832
She'll come to understand.

1032
01:58:09,746 --> 01:58:11,008
I've seen it.

1033
01:58:12,575 --> 01:58:14,403
You can see?

1034
01:58:14,577 --> 01:58:16,883
The visions are clear now.

1035
01:58:19,147 --> 01:58:22,846
I see possible futures.
All at once.

1036
01:58:24,108 --> 01:58:27,372
Our enemies are all around us.

1037
01:58:27,546 --> 01:58:29,940
And in so many futures, they prevail.

1038
01:58:30,897 --> 01:58:32,682
But I do see a way.

1039
01:58:33,987 --> 01:58:36,164
There is a narrow way through.

1040
01:58:46,565 --> 01:58:48,306
I saw our bloodline, Mother.

1041
01:58:49,699 --> 01:58:51,092
Written across time.

1042
01:59:03,756 --> 01:59:06,411
You are the daughter
of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.

1043
01:59:09,327 --> 01:59:10,807
Did my father know?

1044
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:20,077
I didn't know myself,
until I took the worm's poison.

1045
01:59:27,954 --> 01:59:29,434
We're Harkonnens.

1046
01:59:33,569 --> 01:59:35,614
So this is how we'll survive.

1047
01:59:37,355 --> 01:59:38,878
By being Harkonnens.

1048
02:01:15,932 --> 02:01:16,933
We must talk.

1049
02:01:19,022 --> 02:01:21,764
Stilgar, you can stop this.
Do you hear me?

1050
02:01:21,938 --> 02:01:23,488
You have the power to stop this.

1051
02:01:23,592 --> 02:01:25,115
Northern woman!

1052
02:01:25,289 --> 02:01:27,033
You are not allowed
to speak inside the circle.

1053
02:01:27,117 --> 02:01:28,643
If you want to speak, you know what to do.

1054
02:01:28,727 --> 02:01:31,948
Stilgar, please.
For Arrakis' sake.

1055
02:01:44,613 --> 02:01:47,398
This prophecy is how they enslave us!

1056
02:01:47,572 --> 02:01:49,574
How they dominate--

1057
02:01:49,748 --> 02:01:51,359
You'll get yourself in trouble.

1058
02:01:51,533 --> 02:01:52,983
This is none of your business.

1059
02:01:53,143 --> 02:01:55,104
Rabban Harkonnen himself killed my family.

1060
02:01:55,188 --> 02:01:57,138
He gave me this scar to remember him by.

1061
02:01:57,190 --> 02:01:59,062
This is all of my business.

1062
02:02:46,239 --> 02:02:48,241
Only tribe leaders can speak.

1063
02:02:48,416 --> 02:02:50,418
If you wish to share your voice,

1064
02:02:50,592 --> 02:02:53,377
you must take his place by defeating him

1065
02:02:53,551 --> 02:02:55,945
and returning his water to the well.

1066
02:02:56,119 --> 02:03:00,210
You think I'm stupid enough to deprive
myself of the best of us?

1067
02:03:00,384 --> 02:03:02,386
Do you smash a knife before battle?

1068
02:03:03,866 --> 02:03:05,868
Take my life, Usul.

1069
02:03:06,042 --> 02:03:07,957
It is the only way.

1070
02:03:08,131 --> 02:03:09,915
I'm pointing the way!

1071
02:03:12,265 --> 02:03:13,876
Slow down.

1072
02:03:14,050 --> 02:03:17,314
There is no one in this room

1073
02:03:17,488 --> 02:03:19,534
who can stand against me.

1074
02:03:31,415 --> 02:03:36,072
Your mothers warned you about my coming.

1075
02:03:36,899 --> 02:03:38,857
Fear the moment.

1076
02:03:49,433 --> 02:03:51,392
But you think you could have a chance.

1077
02:03:53,785 --> 02:03:56,875
But you're afraid.

1078
02:03:57,049 --> 02:03:59,704
What if I could be the One?

1079
02:03:59,878 --> 02:04:04,448
This could be the moment you've
been praying for, all your life.

1080
02:04:07,495 --> 02:04:09,758
You're praying now

1081
02:04:09,932 --> 02:04:11,020
to your grandmother.

1082
02:04:11,977 --> 02:04:15,851
She died nine moons ago.

1083
02:04:17,940 --> 02:04:19,637
She lost an eye.

1084
02:04:19,811 --> 02:04:24,033
A rock smashed her face
as she was crossing the Belt.

1085
02:04:24,207 --> 02:04:25,607
She was 12 when it happened.

1086
02:04:27,428 --> 02:04:31,780
At that time, this world
had a Fremen name.

1087
02:04:35,523 --> 02:04:36,959
Dune.

1088
02:04:37,133 --> 02:04:38,613
Lisan al-Gaib!

1089
02:04:38,787 --> 02:04:40,919
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

1090
02:04:42,399 --> 02:04:43,661
Lisan al-Gaib!

1091
02:04:47,448 --> 02:04:49,537
In your nightmares

1092
02:04:49,711 --> 02:04:51,887
you give water to the dead

1093
02:04:52,061 --> 02:04:54,759
and it brings joy to your heart!

1094
02:04:54,933 --> 02:04:55,891
Muad'Dib!

1095
02:04:56,065 --> 02:04:57,849
Muad'Dib.

1096
02:05:02,419 --> 02:05:06,162
Mahdi, what do you foresee for us?

1097
02:05:07,511 --> 02:05:09,121
Green Paradise.

1098
02:05:11,602 --> 02:05:13,561
Lisan al-Gaib.

1099
02:05:13,735 --> 02:05:15,693
Show us the Way!

1100
02:05:22,352 --> 02:05:24,397
This is my father's ducal signet.

1101
02:05:34,669 --> 02:05:37,236
I am
Paul Muad'Dib Atreides,

1102
02:05:37,410 --> 02:05:40,283
Duke of Arrakis.

1103
02:05:40,457 --> 02:05:42,764
The Hand of God be my witness.

1104
02:05:42,938 --> 02:05:45,114
I am the Voice from the Outer World.

1105
02:05:45,288 --> 02:05:46,768
I will lead you

1106
02:05:46,942 --> 02:05:48,421
to PARADISE!

1107
02:05:48,596 --> 02:05:50,119
Lisan al-Gaib!

1108
02:05:50,293 --> 02:05:52,295
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

1109
02:05:52,469 --> 02:05:56,517
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

1110
02:05:56,691 --> 02:05:59,432
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

1111
02:05:59,607 --> 02:06:02,435
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

1112
02:06:02,610 --> 02:06:05,526
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

1113
02:06:05,700 --> 02:06:08,790
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

1114
02:06:08,964 --> 02:06:10,487
Lisan al-Gaib!

1115
02:06:47,959 --> 02:06:50,222
Paul Atreides is still alive.

1116
02:06:51,963 --> 02:06:53,574
He challenges my father.

1117
02:06:54,923 --> 02:06:56,577
You've never been on Arrakis.

1118
02:06:58,230 --> 02:07:00,102
It's quite impressive.
You'll see.

1119
02:07:00,276 --> 02:07:01,726
Was this all upon your advice?

1120
02:07:01,799 --> 02:07:03,758
What?

1121
02:07:03,932 --> 02:07:06,848
Did you counsel my father
to exterminate the Atreides?

1122
02:07:07,022 --> 02:07:10,286
Of course I did. Why else
would it have happened?

1123
02:07:10,460 --> 02:07:12,593
You tried to sacrifice
an entire bloodline.

1124
02:07:12,767 --> 02:07:14,769
And I was right to do it.

1125
02:07:14,943 --> 02:07:17,946
The Kwisatz Haderach is a form of power

1126
02:07:18,120 --> 02:07:20,296
that our world has not yet seen.

1127
02:07:20,470 --> 02:07:22,820
The ultimate power.

1128
02:07:22,994 --> 02:07:24,692
For 90 generations,

1129
02:07:24,866 --> 02:07:26,824
we have supervised
House Atreides.

1130
02:07:26,998 --> 02:07:29,961
They were promising, but they were
becoming dangerously defiant.

1131
02:07:30,045 --> 02:07:33,483
Their bloodline had to be terminated.

1132
02:07:33,657 --> 02:07:36,007
That is why we have put
many bloodlines at work.

1133
02:07:36,007 --> 02:07:36,921
Several prospects.

1134
02:07:37,095 --> 02:07:38,488
But it's backfired.

1135
02:07:38,662 --> 02:07:40,185
Paul is alive.

1136
02:07:40,359 --> 02:07:42,359
And if he defeats Feyd-Rautha, my father--

1137
02:07:42,361 --> 02:07:46,452
Your father will lose the throne
no matter who prevails.

1138
02:07:46,627 --> 02:07:49,499
But there is one way your
family can remain in power

1139
02:07:49,673 --> 02:07:52,894
and, through you, the continuation
of our stewardship.

1140
02:07:54,069 --> 02:07:55,810
One. Way.

1141
02:07:56,637 --> 02:07:58,943
Are you prepared?

1142
02:07:59,117 --> 02:08:01,817
You've been preparing me my
whole life, Reverend Mother.

1143
02:08:04,079 --> 02:08:06,298
You're heading north with the others?

1144
02:08:06,472 --> 02:08:08,344
I'm Fedaykin.

1145
02:08:08,518 --> 02:08:11,045
I follow my leaders. If fighting
goes north, I go north.

1146
02:08:11,129 --> 02:08:12,569
Paul didn't have a choice, Chani.

1147
02:08:12,653 --> 02:08:15,046
I won't be fighting for him.

1148
02:08:15,220 --> 02:08:16,570
I'm fighting for my people.

1149
02:08:20,443 --> 02:08:22,184
I came to wish you best of luck.

1150
02:08:23,576 --> 02:08:24,969
I'd wish you the same,

1151
02:08:26,971 --> 02:08:28,721
but it seems you've won your battle.

1152
02:08:51,822 --> 02:08:53,171
He took the bait.

1153
02:08:59,917 --> 02:09:01,745
Oh, the Emperor's very obliging.

1154
02:09:02,833 --> 02:09:05,357
He's right on time.

1155
02:09:05,531 --> 02:09:07,533
As you foresaw, Muad'Dib.

1156
02:09:09,057 --> 02:09:11,450
A great-grandmother of a storm.

1157
02:09:37,694 --> 02:09:39,783
What is he doing here?

1158
02:09:39,957 --> 02:09:42,003
I brought spice production under control.

1159
02:09:45,267 --> 02:09:46,442
What do we do?

1160
02:09:47,965 --> 02:09:50,707
Send messages to the Great Houses.

1161
02:09:50,881 --> 02:09:54,798
Tell them that Arrakis
is under Sardaukar attack.

1162
02:09:54,972 --> 02:09:57,758
Tell them their future
hangs in the balance.

1163
02:10:21,694 --> 02:10:24,828
He brought his whole army.

1164
02:10:25,002 --> 02:10:27,483
When the storm hits this ridge,

1165
02:10:27,657 --> 02:10:29,877
Gurney will open the way for you, Stilgar,

1166
02:10:30,051 --> 02:10:32,227
so you can enter the basin from the West

1167
02:10:32,401 --> 02:10:34,707
and distract their defense systems.

1168
02:10:34,882 --> 02:10:36,582
Chani, I want you and your Fedaykin

1169
02:10:36,666 --> 02:10:38,066
to then attack from the East,

1170
02:10:38,973 --> 02:10:40,931
inside the basin.

1171
02:10:41,105 --> 02:10:43,064
I'll strike from the
North, head on,

1172
02:10:43,238 --> 02:10:45,196
with the Fundamentalist troops.

1173
02:10:45,370 --> 02:10:48,025
And I'll serve Arrakeen for dessert.

1174
02:10:48,199 --> 02:10:51,202
Remember,
I need the Emperor alive.

1175
02:10:51,376 --> 02:10:53,509
Long live the fighters!

1176
02:11:50,696 --> 02:11:51,697
Hm.

1177
02:11:59,923 --> 02:12:02,186
Baron,

1178
02:12:02,360 --> 02:12:07,017
do you have any idea
who this Muad'Dib could be?

1179
02:12:07,191 --> 02:12:09,977
Some fanatic, your Majesty.
That's all we know.

1180
02:12:10,151 --> 02:12:12,022
More. More. Give me more.

1181
02:12:12,196 --> 02:12:13,241
He's a madman!

1182
02:12:13,415 --> 02:12:15,330
- Mad?
- All Fremen are mad.

1183
02:12:17,854 --> 02:12:19,725
That's all you know?

1184
02:12:19,900 --> 02:12:21,771
Really?

1185
02:12:21,945 --> 02:12:23,555
Muad'Dib is dead.

1186
02:12:25,993 --> 02:12:28,821
Or he went hiding in the Southern storms

1187
02:12:28,996 --> 02:12:30,475
which means the same thing.

1188
02:12:30,649 --> 02:12:31,523
They speak the truth.

1189
02:12:31,607 --> 02:12:32,869
Your Majesty,

1190
02:12:33,043 --> 02:12:34,395
the sand storm that's approaching

1191
02:12:34,479 --> 02:12:36,873
threatens the integrity of our shields.

1192
02:12:37,047 --> 02:12:38,919
We recommend going back into orbit.

1193
02:12:39,093 --> 02:12:41,593
Well, the mountains will protect
us from most of it,

1194
02:12:42,052 --> 02:12:43,271
your Majesty.

1195
02:12:45,099 --> 02:12:49,103
Baron, have you ever investigated

1196
02:12:49,277 --> 02:12:52,584
the south regions of Arrakis?

1197
02:12:52,758 --> 02:12:55,239
Well, the entire region is uninhabitable.

1198
02:12:55,413 --> 02:12:57,938
It's well known, your Majesty.

1199
02:12:58,112 --> 02:13:02,072
Your uninhabited South

1200
02:13:02,246 --> 02:13:05,206
exhibits evidence of human activity.

1201
02:13:05,380 --> 02:13:07,643
I wasn't aware of this.

1202
02:13:07,817 --> 02:13:10,080
I swear to you, I wasn't
aware of any of this.

1203
02:13:15,216 --> 02:13:16,739
Muad'Dib is alive.

1204
02:13:18,088 --> 02:13:19,307
I must find him.

1205
02:14:34,251 --> 02:14:36,514
Long live the fighters!

1206
02:14:39,865 --> 02:14:41,215
Fire!

1207
02:15:21,124 --> 02:15:23,300
Sardaukar! On guard!

1208
02:19:37,337 --> 02:19:38,294
Sardaukar!

1209
02:20:43,664 --> 02:20:45,100
Grandfather.

1210
02:21:07,296 --> 02:21:08,732
You die like an animal.

1211
02:21:40,068 --> 02:21:42,026
Muad'Dib.

1212
02:21:42,200 --> 02:21:44,289
Bring the prisoners to the Residency.

1213
02:21:45,508 --> 02:21:47,641
Kill the Sardaukar.

1214
02:21:49,991 --> 02:21:52,428
Give the Baron's body to the desert.

1215
02:23:10,680 --> 02:23:11,768
Rabban!

1216
02:23:22,953 --> 02:23:24,607
Look who's back from the dead.

1217
02:23:39,100 --> 02:23:42,494
For my Duke, and my friends.

1218
02:24:48,038 --> 02:24:49,039
Warships.

1219
02:24:51,476 --> 02:24:52,608
The Great Houses.

1220
02:24:54,088 --> 02:24:56,568
Gurney, it's time.
Bring the prisoners.

1221
02:24:56,743 --> 02:25:00,094
My Lord.

1222
02:25:24,031 --> 02:25:25,206
This isn't over yet.

1223
02:25:31,255 --> 02:25:32,517
I want you to know...

1224
02:25:35,477 --> 02:25:37,435
I will love you as long as I breathe.

1225
02:25:49,752 --> 02:25:52,015
There is a massed armada in orbit.

1226
02:25:55,584 --> 02:25:59,196
You're facing a full invasion, Fremen.

1227
02:25:59,370 --> 02:26:02,417
How can you be so sure the Great
Houses are here for me?

1228
02:26:08,466 --> 02:26:12,688
They may be curious to hear my side
of the story, don't you think?

1229
02:26:12,862 --> 02:26:17,258
I am Paul Atreides, son of Leto
Atreides, Duke of Arrakis.

1230
02:26:19,086 --> 02:26:20,565
- Gurney.
- My Lord.

1231
02:26:20,740 --> 02:26:22,959
Send a warning to all ships.

1232
02:26:23,133 --> 02:26:26,833
If the Great Houses attack,
our atomics will obliterate all spice fields.

1233
02:26:28,530 --> 02:26:31,054
- You're out of your mind.
- He's bluffing.

1234
02:26:31,228 --> 02:26:33,277
Consider what you're
about to do, Paul Atreides.

1235
02:26:33,361 --> 02:26:35,406
Silence!

1236
02:26:37,757 --> 02:26:39,106
Abomination.

1237
02:26:43,458 --> 02:26:44,851
Message sent, my Lord.

1238
02:26:46,983 --> 02:26:50,552
As a servant of the Imperium,
you will bow at my feet.

1239
02:26:50,726 --> 02:26:54,164
Your feet? You'll be lucky
to keep your head.

1240
02:26:57,515 --> 02:26:59,265
I'll take the hand of your daughter.

1241
02:27:01,693 --> 02:27:03,565
She will remain safe.

1242
02:27:03,739 --> 02:27:06,133
And we will rule together over the Empire.

1243
02:27:15,969 --> 02:27:17,231
But you...

1244
02:27:20,103 --> 02:27:21,801
You have to answer for my father.

1245
02:27:29,373 --> 02:27:32,986
Do you know why I killed him?

1246
02:27:34,378 --> 02:27:36,206
Because he was a man

1247
02:27:36,380 --> 02:27:38,295
who believed in the rules of the heart.

1248
02:27:39,819 --> 02:27:41,646
But the heart is not meant to rule.

1249
02:27:43,170 --> 02:27:44,171
In other words...

1250
02:27:46,738 --> 02:27:50,264
your father was a weak man.

1251
02:27:59,403 --> 02:28:02,406
Stand or choose your champion.

1252
02:28:05,235 --> 02:28:06,758
I am here, Atreides.

1253
02:28:09,239 --> 02:28:10,371
I need a blade.

1254
02:28:10,545 --> 02:28:12,068
Accept mine.

1255
02:28:24,167 --> 02:28:26,996
Do not stain your hands on this animal.

1256
02:28:27,170 --> 02:28:28,476
Let me deal with him.

1257
02:28:28,650 --> 02:28:30,260
It's my burden, Gurney.

1258
02:28:48,931 --> 02:28:51,194
Why does he take such risks?

1259
02:28:51,368 --> 02:28:53,718
Muad'Dib leads the way.

1260
02:29:17,568 --> 02:29:20,920
I'm happy to finally meet you, cousin.

1261
02:29:22,225 --> 02:29:24,967
Cousin? Is that right?

1262
02:29:27,404 --> 02:29:32,192
Well, you wouldn't be
the first relative I've killed.

1263
02:29:35,021 --> 02:29:37,762
May thy knife chip and shatter.

1264
02:29:41,114 --> 02:29:45,205
May thy knife chip and shatter.

1265
02:30:36,299 --> 02:30:38,998
She's your pet?

1266
02:30:54,056 --> 02:30:57,190
Any special attention for the pet?

1267
02:32:24,146 --> 02:32:25,974
You have fought well, Atreides.

1268
02:32:33,677 --> 02:32:35,288
Lisan al-Gaib!

1269
02:32:35,462 --> 02:32:37,551
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

1270
02:33:30,256 --> 02:33:32,736
You should've believed.

1271
02:33:32,910 --> 02:33:34,390
You chose the wrong side.

1272
02:33:35,826 --> 02:33:37,306
Side?

1273
02:33:37,480 --> 02:33:40,440
You, of all people, should know.

1274
02:33:40,614 --> 02:33:45,009
There are no sides...
Reverend Mother.

1275
02:34:04,246 --> 02:34:06,074
The life debt has been paid.

1276
02:34:06,248 --> 02:34:07,948
Spare my father now and I will
be your willing bride.

1277
02:34:08,032 --> 02:34:09,382
The throne will be yours.

1278
02:35:42,126 --> 02:35:45,478
My Lord, the Great Houses have answered.

1279
02:35:45,652 --> 02:35:47,452
They refuse to honor your ascendancy.

1280
02:35:49,133 --> 02:35:52,267
We await your orders,
Lisan al-Gaib.

1281
02:36:01,363 --> 02:36:03,060
Lead them to Paradise.

1282
02:36:03,234 --> 02:36:04,758
Lisan al-Gaib!

1283
02:36:04,932 --> 02:36:07,108
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

1284
02:36:22,123 --> 02:36:25,648
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

1285
02:36:34,396 --> 02:36:36,093
What is happening, Mother?

1286
02:36:38,226 --> 02:36:40,533
Your brother attacks the Great Houses.

1287
02:36:44,232 --> 02:36:46,495
The Holy War begins.
