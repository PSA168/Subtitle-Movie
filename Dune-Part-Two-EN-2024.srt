00:00:52,063 --> 00:00:56,602
<i>Imperial Diary.
Year 10,191. Third comment.</i>

2
00:00:59,738 --> 00:01:03,374
<i>The battle for Arrakis
took everyone by surprise.</i>

3
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,611
<i>There were no witnesses.</i>

4
00:01:07,646 --> 00:01:10,749
<i>The Harkonnen operation
was perpetrated overnight,</i>

5
00:01:10,782 --> 00:01:14,653
<i>without warning or declaration of war.</i>

6
00:01:16,822 --> 00:01:19,357
<i>By morning,
the Atreides were no more.</i>

7
00:01:21,092 --> 00:01:22,260
<i>All died in the dark.</i>

8
00:01:31,269 --> 00:01:32,738
<i>And the Emperor said...</i>

9
00:01:36,307 --> 00:01:37,174
<i>nothing.</i>

10
00:01:39,745 --> 00:01:42,246
<i>Since that night, my father
has not been the same.</i>

11
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:44,449
<i>Nor have I.</i>

12
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,755
<i>His inaction is difficult
for me to accept.</i>

13
00:01:49,788 --> 00:01:52,691
<i>For, I know he loved
Duke Leto Atreides like a son.</i>

14
00:01:59,196 --> 00:02:00,866
<i>But my father's always been guided</i>

15
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,269
<i>by the calculus of power.</i>

16
00:02:05,303 --> 00:02:08,272
<i>This would not be the first time the
Harkonnens have done his dirty work.</i>

17
00:02:16,815 --> 00:02:19,350
In the shadows of Arrakis
lie many secrets...

18
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,221
<i>but the darkest of
them all may remain.</i>

19
00:02:25,824 --> 00:02:27,559
<i>The end of House Atreides.</i>

20
00:02:43,609 --> 00:02:46,812
<i>Sister, Father is dead.</i>

21
00:02:48,447 --> 00:02:50,247
<i>Shouldn't you go back
to the stars,</i>

22
00:02:51,248 --> 00:02:52,116
<i>be with him?</i>

23
00:02:54,686 --> 00:02:57,856
<i>I'm afraid I won't have enough
time to fix things before your coming.</i>

24
00:03:00,424 --> 00:03:02,661
<i>This world is beyond cruelty.</i>

25
00:04:09,494 --> 00:04:10,929
Stay here.

26
00:09:00,118 --> 00:09:03,555
Never stand with your back
towards the open.

27
00:09:03,588 --> 00:09:05,223
How many times do I have
to tell you that, huh?

28
00:09:05,256 --> 00:09:07,625
You okay?

29
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:09,894
- Yeah.
- How 'bout her?

30
00:09:11,963 --> 00:09:12,931
She's fine.

31
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:23,708
They do not usually
venture this deep.

32
00:09:23,742 --> 00:09:25,577
They wanna make sure
no Atreides escaped.

33
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,046
You think too much of yourself.

34
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:30,815
No, no,
we are in the deep desert.

35
00:09:30,849 --> 00:09:33,685
Only Fremen can survive here.

36
00:09:33,718 --> 00:09:36,054
They were here for us,
not for you.

37
00:09:36,087 --> 00:09:39,024
Don't worry.

38
00:09:39,057 --> 00:09:42,127
I'm taking you somewhere
they will never find us.

39
00:09:59,377 --> 00:10:01,579
Filthy water.

40
00:10:01,613 --> 00:10:05,683
It's full of chemicals, but good
enough for cooling systems.

41
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:10,688
Don't let it out.

42
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:15,126
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

43
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,327
Don't let that out.

44
00:10:16,361 --> 00:10:18,696
Don't let it out!

45
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:24,102
- I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

46
00:10:24,135 --> 00:10:25,036
Mm-hmm.

47
00:10:29,741 --> 00:10:30,875
You fought well...

48
00:10:31,943 --> 00:10:33,111
once you woke up.

49
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:35,280
I wasn't sleeping.

50
00:11:06,878 --> 00:11:08,880
No, no, no. I'll do it.

51
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:15,713
Lor... Lord Rabban.

52
00:12:15,747 --> 00:12:17,849
Now that the spice fields
have been secured,

53
00:12:17,882 --> 00:12:21,119
I strongly recommend bringing
all troops out of Fremen territories.

54
00:12:21,152 --> 00:12:23,021
We're losing too many men
to the desert.

55
00:12:23,054 --> 00:12:24,355
Rats.

56
00:12:26,057 --> 00:12:29,027
- I beg your pardon?
- We're losing men to rats.

57
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,265
Fremen!
I can't confirm, my Lord.

58
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:36,134
Communications are hectic
in the open sands.

59
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:39,037
Your orders were to control
the whole planet.

60
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:43,942
- We are.
- I see only half of it.

61
00:12:43,975 --> 00:12:45,176
As you may recall,

62
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:48,046
the South is uninhabitable,
my Lord.

63
00:12:50,381 --> 00:12:52,250
May I suggest you get some rest?

64
00:12:52,283 --> 00:12:55,186
Rats! Hairy rats!

65
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,523
Kill them! Kill them!
Kill them all!

66
00:12:57,556 --> 00:12:59,491
Kill them all!

67
00:12:59,525 --> 00:13:02,060
<i>Rats!</i>

68
00:13:48,306 --> 00:13:49,541
He's asking why we're so late.

69
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,448
He thinks you're spies.

70
00:13:59,183 --> 00:14:01,487
- He said...
- I got that.

71
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,056
- Thanks.
- Stay close to me. Hmm?

72
00:14:25,243 --> 00:14:26,311
Sietch Tabr.

73
00:16:00,405 --> 00:16:01,607
<i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

74
00:17:01,533 --> 00:17:04,135
Look how your Bene Gesserit
propaganda has taken root.

75
00:17:07,171 --> 00:17:09,106
Some of them already think
I'm their messiah.

76
00:17:11,042 --> 00:17:12,109
Others...

77
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:14,646
false prophet.

78
00:17:16,314 --> 00:17:19,317
I must sway the non-believers.

79
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,353
If they follow me, we can
disrupt spice production.

80
00:17:22,386 --> 00:17:24,222
That's the only way
I can get to the Emperor.

81
00:17:25,824 --> 00:17:27,425
Your father didn't believe
in revenge.

82
00:17:28,594 --> 00:17:29,528
Yeah, well, I do.

83
00:18:03,227 --> 00:18:04,161
What is happening?

84
00:18:13,237 --> 00:18:14,506
What is it?

85
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,240
There is spice in the food.

86
00:18:26,718 --> 00:18:28,185
Woman.

87
00:18:30,221 --> 00:18:32,123
Come with me.

88
00:19:41,727 --> 00:19:45,196
Thirty-eight million decaliters.

89
00:19:45,229 --> 00:19:50,736
None of us, even dying of
thirst, would ever drink this water.

90
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:51,803
This is...

91
00:19:53,337 --> 00:19:54,473
sacred.

92
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,711
Jamis' water.

93
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:04,583
We have a thousand such places.

94
00:20:05,684 --> 00:20:08,954
When we have enough water,

95
00:20:08,987 --> 00:20:13,592
the <i>Lisan al-Gaib</i> will change
the face of Arrakis.

96
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,260
He will bring back the trees.
He will bring back...

97
00:20:18,262 --> 00:20:19,464
a Green Paradise.

98
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:24,301
So many souls.

99
00:20:34,646 --> 00:20:38,382
Never give your water away,
not even for the dead. Hmm?

100
00:20:41,285 --> 00:20:42,688
Why are you showing me this?

101
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:44,422
Because you are Bene Gesserit.

102
00:20:44,456 --> 00:20:48,392
Because you understand
the prophecies.

103
00:20:48,426 --> 00:20:51,730
The mother of the <i>Lisan al-Gaib</i>
will be a Reverend Mother.

104
00:20:52,998 --> 00:20:55,534
Our Reverend Mother is dying.

105
00:20:57,368 --> 00:20:59,571
You want me to take her place?

106
00:20:59,604 --> 00:21:02,474
Yes, I do.

107
00:21:04,943 --> 00:21:06,377
You believe in Paul?

108
00:21:09,047 --> 00:21:10,582
There are signs.

109
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:13,719
Yes.

110
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,022
What if I would refuse?

111
00:21:17,055 --> 00:21:19,958
Mmm.
Then, he's not <i>Lisan al-Gaib,</i>

112
00:21:19,991 --> 00:21:22,027
and you have no purpose
to serve.

113
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:26,031
What else is left to do then but
to return your water to the well?

114
00:21:26,064 --> 00:21:27,632
Huh.

115
00:21:31,335 --> 00:21:32,504
It's an honor, isn't it?

116
00:21:34,371 --> 00:21:35,774
I think you should feel honored.

117
00:21:35,807 --> 00:21:37,843
Well, it was a choice
between this or death,

118
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:39,711
so, you know, forgive me
if I'm not flattered.

119
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,582
How does one become
a Reverend Mother?

120
00:21:43,615 --> 00:21:45,584
It's different from one culture
to another.

121
00:21:45,617 --> 00:21:47,519
Here on Arrakis, I have no idea.

122
00:21:51,857 --> 00:21:54,025
You're afraid.

123
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:55,961
Reverend Mothers are tasked
with holding the memories

124
00:21:55,994 --> 00:21:57,829
of all the Reverend Mothers
that came before them,

125
00:21:57,863 --> 00:22:01,032
so I'll be given centuries
of pain and sorrow.

126
00:22:01,867 --> 00:22:02,734
Is it dangerous?

127
00:22:03,735 --> 00:22:05,369
It's lethal for men.

128
00:22:06,004 --> 00:22:07,806
That's for sure.

129
00:23:16,141 --> 00:23:18,076
What are you guys
laughing about?

130
00:23:18,109 --> 00:23:19,343
Don't bother.

131
00:23:24,516 --> 00:23:25,717
You don't believe in all this?

132
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,384
No, we don't.

133
00:23:27,418 --> 00:23:29,087
These are old Southern beliefs.

134
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,388
Southern beliefs?

135
00:23:31,422 --> 00:23:34,726
Southern tribes believe a messiah
will come to deliver us from evil.

136
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:36,828
You don't believe
in the <i>Lisan al-Gaib?</i>

137
00:23:36,862 --> 00:23:39,164
We believe in Fremen.

138
00:23:41,566 --> 00:23:44,669
You want to control people,
you tell them a messiah will come.

139
00:23:44,703 --> 00:23:48,439
- Mm-hmm.
- Then they'll wait for centuries.

140
00:23:51,509 --> 00:23:54,579
Now, we must pray.

141
00:24:02,053 --> 00:24:03,021
What about him?

142
00:24:03,054 --> 00:24:04,756
- Stilgar?
- Mm-hmm.

143
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:07,893
He's from the South.
You didn't notice his accent?

144
00:24:17,035 --> 00:24:18,203
What'll happen to my mother?

145
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:43,495
I must not fear.
Fear is the mind-killer.

146
00:24:43,528 --> 00:24:46,498
Fear, the little death
that brings total obliteration.

147
00:24:46,531 --> 00:24:48,600
I will face my fear. I will...

148
00:25:15,226 --> 00:25:16,127
What is it?

149
00:25:16,161 --> 00:25:17,095
Drink!

150
00:27:27,859 --> 00:27:30,161
She's right. She's right!

151
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,364
It's no miracle.

152
00:27:34,966 --> 00:27:37,836
My mother was trained
to do that.

153
00:27:37,869 --> 00:27:40,772
Poison transmutation is something
advanced Bene Gesserit can do.

154
00:27:44,242 --> 00:27:45,376
I'm not the <i>Mahdi.</i>

155
00:27:49,047 --> 00:27:50,248
I'm not here to lead.

156
00:27:56,455 --> 00:27:59,691
Let me fight beside you.
That's all I'm asking.

157
00:28:23,148 --> 00:28:24,082
How are you?

158
00:28:25,116 --> 00:28:26,117
Better.

159
00:28:27,218 --> 00:28:28,219
How is she?

160
00:28:29,854 --> 00:28:31,356
She was frightened, but she's...

161
00:28:33,024 --> 00:28:34,025
she's okay.

162
00:28:40,231 --> 00:28:41,132
Paul.

163
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:46,070
She talks to me.

164
00:28:49,274 --> 00:28:51,109
She believes in you.

165
00:28:54,513 --> 00:28:55,780
She says...

166
00:29:03,154 --> 00:29:05,290
You're so close now.

167
00:29:05,323 --> 00:29:09,327
Only one step remains and you
will become the <i>Kwisatz Haderach.</i>

168
00:29:10,428 --> 00:29:12,197
Only one step remains.

169
00:29:13,164 --> 00:29:14,799
You must do what I did.

170
00:29:14,832 --> 00:29:18,136
You must drink
the Water of Life.

171
00:29:18,169 --> 00:29:21,839
And your mind, it's gon... it's
gonna open and you will see.

172
00:29:32,884 --> 00:29:37,523
If you wanna fight with us,
first thing, you must learn

173
00:29:37,556 --> 00:29:39,491
to be one with the desert.

174
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:44,496
So, here is a tent
and enough food.

175
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:49,267
I want you to cross
that small erg and come back.

176
00:29:50,068 --> 00:29:51,803
Travel by night.

177
00:29:51,836 --> 00:29:53,304
You know how to use
a paracompass?

178
00:29:53,338 --> 00:29:54,305
- Yes.
- Oh.

179
00:29:57,476 --> 00:29:59,010
Anything else I should know?

180
00:29:59,043 --> 00:30:01,447
Uh, beside the worms
and the Harkonnens,

181
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,216
beware of the trapdoor spiders.

182
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:08,820
Centipedes are very nasty.
Not the big ones.

183
00:30:08,853 --> 00:30:10,489
They are harmless.

184
00:30:10,522 --> 00:30:14,192
But the little ones, you have
to worry about. And... Oh!

185
00:30:16,894 --> 00:30:20,331
Don't ever,
ever listen to the jinn.

186
00:30:22,601 --> 00:30:24,269
- The jinn?
- Jinn.

187
00:30:24,302 --> 00:30:25,970
Desert spirits.

188
00:30:27,405 --> 00:30:30,074
They whisper at night.

189
00:30:34,245 --> 00:30:37,048
They, they can possess you.

190
00:30:37,081 --> 00:30:41,119
Really, be careful.
They are demons.

191
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:46,157
But it's true.
Don't listen to them.

192
00:32:11,577 --> 00:32:13,111
Jamis.

193
00:32:15,514 --> 00:32:17,949
You sandwalk
like a drunk lizard.

194
00:32:21,185 --> 00:32:22,688
Yeah, I'm doing
pretty good so far.

195
00:32:22,721 --> 00:32:25,289
Yeah, well, you're not even
in worm territory yet.

196
00:32:44,308 --> 00:32:46,010
You have to break up
your rhythm.

197
00:32:50,114 --> 00:32:52,350
Like this.

198
00:32:52,383 --> 00:32:55,253
Now, that's interesting because
in the filmbooks I've studied,

199
00:32:55,286 --> 00:32:58,557
the anthropologists say, in order to
properly sandwalk, you actually have...

200
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,496
Never mind. Please keep going.

201
00:33:33,024 --> 00:33:36,360
You know, I'm the only one who believes
you're gonna make it until summer?

202
00:33:36,394 --> 00:33:38,162
Everyone else thinks
you won't make it two weeks.

203
00:33:39,531 --> 00:33:40,998
If you wanna follow us
in the desert,

204
00:33:41,032 --> 00:33:42,468
you need to know
how windtraps work.

205
00:33:42,501 --> 00:33:44,302
So, listen to me.

206
00:33:44,335 --> 00:33:46,605
They're simple, but they
require constant attention.

207
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:50,107
Uh, this right here,
it captures the moisture

208
00:33:50,141 --> 00:33:51,577
and then it carries it
into that pocket.

209
00:33:52,678 --> 00:33:55,747
Uh, and these are the filters.

210
00:33:55,781 --> 00:33:57,449
They need to be changed
every three days.

211
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,218
What?

212
00:34:05,056 --> 00:34:06,558
Stop looking at me like that.

213
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,632
He's training with the Fremen.

214
00:34:13,665 --> 00:34:15,634
He will be back soon.
Don't worry.

215
00:34:16,768 --> 00:34:17,636
Mm-hmm.

216
00:34:19,203 --> 00:34:22,674
You're right. If we want
to protect your brother,

217
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:25,811
we need all the Fremen
to believe in the prophecy.

218
00:34:30,381 --> 00:34:34,653
<i>We must convert
the non-believers one by one.</i>

219
00:34:36,788 --> 00:34:39,323
<i>We need to start
with the weaker ones.</i>

220
00:34:40,492 --> 00:34:42,226
<i>The vulnerable ones.</i>

221
00:34:43,795 --> 00:34:46,330
<i>The ones who fear us.</i>

222
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,823
Hey, get out of here. Go.

223
00:36:54,526 --> 00:36:56,260
- You okay?
- Yeah.

224
00:37:33,699 --> 00:37:34,833
Let's go! Move!

225
00:37:52,383 --> 00:37:53,618
Load.

226
00:38:13,638 --> 00:38:14,840
Chani!

227
00:38:19,878 --> 00:38:20,746
Reload!

228
00:38:35,527 --> 00:38:37,028
Ugh! Reload.

229
00:38:37,062 --> 00:38:38,329
Oh, watch out!

230
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,048
Its shield will
only open when it fires.

231
00:38:57,082 --> 00:38:58,750
I know that.
What do you think I'm trying to do?

232
00:38:58,784 --> 00:39:01,787
I'll trigger it.
On my signal. Be ready.

233
00:39:24,576 --> 00:39:25,877
Go!

234
00:39:27,646 --> 00:39:29,548
Ah, shit!

235
00:39:32,017 --> 00:39:33,885
Go! Go!

236
00:40:39,918 --> 00:40:41,753
Who taught you
to fight like that?

237
00:40:41,786 --> 00:40:43,555
- My old masters.
- Hmm.

238
00:40:43,588 --> 00:40:44,856
They were close friends.

239
00:40:47,959 --> 00:40:51,096
They were massacred.
Alongside my father.

240
00:40:56,668 --> 00:40:59,838
You've been fighting
the Harkonnens for decades.

241
00:40:59,871 --> 00:41:02,439
My family's been fighting them
for centuries.

242
00:41:02,474 --> 00:41:07,444
I know everything about them.
Their habits, their ways of thinking.

243
00:41:07,479 --> 00:41:08,713
You know everything
about the desert.

244
00:41:08,747 --> 00:41:12,450
You harness
the very power of it.

245
00:41:12,484 --> 00:41:17,222
We can stop them together, bury
them in the sand where they belong.

246
00:41:17,255 --> 00:41:19,724
So that this planet
can be yours once more.

247
00:41:19,758 --> 00:41:23,528
What would you have us do? Huh?

248
00:41:23,561 --> 00:41:25,463
What would you do, Stilgar?

249
00:41:25,497 --> 00:41:29,567
I? I would... would
strike even further north.

250
00:41:29,601 --> 00:41:31,469
Then I will go further north.

251
00:41:31,503 --> 00:41:34,172
And the further north you go,
the more likely it is you die.

252
00:41:58,063 --> 00:42:01,166
I see strength in you.

253
00:42:06,805 --> 00:42:08,039
Come, come.

254
00:42:18,149 --> 00:42:23,855
You shall be know
among us as <i>Usul.</i>

255
00:42:23,888 --> 00:42:25,623
<i>- Usul.
- Usul.</i>

256
00:42:25,657 --> 00:42:29,728
<i>Usul.</i> And now,
a Fedaykin is a fighter

257
00:42:29,761 --> 00:42:30,962
and needs a war name.

258
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:33,231
You must choose.

259
00:42:38,103 --> 00:42:39,571
How do you call the, uh...

260
00:42:41,006 --> 00:42:42,741
The small desert mouse, again?

261
00:42:44,175 --> 00:42:45,877
<i>- Muad'Dib?
- Muad'Dib.</i>

262
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:48,546
No, no, no.

263
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:52,250
<i>Muad'Dib</i> is wise
in the ways of the desert.

264
00:42:52,283 --> 00:42:53,685
<i>Muad'Dib...</i>

265
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:57,155
creates his own water.

266
00:42:57,188 --> 00:43:01,059
The constellation that points to
the North Star, we call <i>Muad'Dib.</i>

267
00:43:01,092 --> 00:43:02,894
"The One Who Points the Way."

268
00:43:04,763 --> 00:43:05,997
That is a powerful name.

269
00:43:10,935 --> 00:43:15,006
Now you are our brother. Mmm.

270
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,176
Paul <i>Muad'Dib Usul.</i>

271
00:43:24,716 --> 00:43:25,817
<i>Muad'Dib Usul.</i>

272
00:43:26,651 --> 00:43:27,719
<i>Muad'Dib Usul.</i>

273
00:43:29,721 --> 00:43:30,989
<i>Muad'Dib Usul.</i>

274
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:35,794
<i>Muad'Dib Usul.</i> Mm.

275
00:43:36,728 --> 00:43:37,629
<i>Muad'Dib.</i>

276
00:43:40,865 --> 00:43:41,800
<i>Usul.</i>

277
00:43:59,384 --> 00:44:01,986
Hey! Stilgar!

278
00:44:16,868 --> 00:44:18,269
Father, I found my way.

279
00:44:35,454 --> 00:44:36,621
It's breathtaking.

280
00:44:45,363 --> 00:44:46,631
Hmm.

281
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:52,303
Look. Right there. Spice.

282
00:44:52,337 --> 00:44:55,173
Arrakis is so beautiful
when the sun is low.

283
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:07,352
Where you're from, does water
really fall from the sky?

284
00:45:07,385 --> 00:45:09,687
Oh, hm, yes.

285
00:45:09,721 --> 00:45:12,891
Sometimes it rains
for weeks on Caladan.

286
00:45:12,924 --> 00:45:15,193
Where you see sand here,
imagine water.

287
00:45:18,363 --> 00:45:22,468
Our castle stands on cliffs
high above the sea.

288
00:45:22,501 --> 00:45:25,436
If you dive in,
you can't reach the bottom.

289
00:45:25,471 --> 00:45:29,440
- You dive in?
- Yes, it's called swimming.

290
00:45:29,475 --> 00:45:32,277
I don't...
I don't believe you, <i>Usul.</i>

291
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:33,378
<i>Usul.</i>

292
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,315
What's your secret name?

293
00:45:39,751 --> 00:45:41,386
<i>Sihaya.</i>

294
00:45:41,419 --> 00:45:42,787
<i>- Sihaya.</i>
- Hmm.

295
00:45:44,255 --> 00:45:45,990
What does that mean?

296
00:45:46,024 --> 00:45:47,859
Means Desert Spring.

297
00:45:47,892 --> 00:45:48,960
"Desert Spring."

298
00:45:50,895 --> 00:45:52,363
- I love it.
- I hate it.

299
00:45:53,532 --> 00:45:55,400
It's from some stupid prophecy.

300
00:45:56,434 --> 00:45:57,469
I prefer Chani.

301
00:45:58,537 --> 00:46:00,071
I prefer Chani, too, then.

302
00:46:07,178 --> 00:46:09,113
Do you think Stilgar
would teach me?

303
00:46:09,147 --> 00:46:10,848
- To ride?
- Yeah.

304
00:46:10,882 --> 00:46:14,118
No. Only Fremen ride worms.

305
00:46:14,152 --> 00:46:15,920
Well, I thought I'd become one,
didn't I?

306
00:46:15,954 --> 00:46:17,822
By name, not by blood.

307
00:46:20,158 --> 00:46:24,862
Your blood comes
from Dukes and Great Houses.

308
00:46:26,898 --> 00:46:29,200
We don't have that here.

309
00:46:29,234 --> 00:46:33,238
Here, we're equal,
men and women alike.

310
00:46:33,271 --> 00:46:35,440
What we do,
we do for the benefit of all.

311
00:46:35,474 --> 00:46:37,842
Well, I'd very much like
to be equal to you.

312
00:46:44,082 --> 00:46:47,318
Paul <i>Muad'Dib Usul...</i>

313
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:51,389
maybe you could be Fremen.

314
00:46:54,593 --> 00:46:55,994
Maybe I'll show you the way.

315
00:48:25,049 --> 00:48:26,351
Rabban.

316
00:48:37,228 --> 00:48:41,600
Fremen attacks on your watch.

317
00:48:41,633 --> 00:48:47,606
Your orders were to restore
spice production to full capacity.

318
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:50,074
Do you know
what it means if you fail?

319
00:48:51,677 --> 00:48:55,581
The Emperor will take spice
out of our control.

320
00:48:56,582 --> 00:48:58,216
Tighten your grip, Rabban.

321
00:48:58,249 --> 00:49:00,284
Uncle.

322
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:02,621
Or feel mine on your neck.

323
00:49:18,336 --> 00:49:20,472
<i>Usul? Usul.</i>

324
00:49:20,506 --> 00:49:23,307
It's okay. It's okay.

325
00:49:26,612 --> 00:49:27,479
Hey.

326
00:49:30,415 --> 00:49:33,519
I'm here, I'm here.

327
00:49:33,552 --> 00:49:36,622
It's been a while since you've
had one of those nightmares.

328
00:49:36,655 --> 00:49:37,623
Mm.

329
00:49:41,493 --> 00:49:43,629
Tell me, what was it about?

330
00:49:49,701 --> 00:49:53,004
<i>Nothing's clear.
It's only fragments.</i>

331
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:58,976
<i>I'm in the South,
and I'm following someone.</i>

332
00:50:00,344 --> 00:50:02,280
<i>And it triggers a holy war.</i>

333
00:50:05,751 --> 00:50:09,455
<i>Millions and millions of people
starving to death...</i>

334
00:50:10,789 --> 00:50:12,156
<i>because of me.</i>

335
00:50:18,062 --> 00:50:21,199
You've been exposed
to spice for a long time.

336
00:50:21,232 --> 00:50:23,301
It can create weird dreams.

337
00:50:30,341 --> 00:50:31,209
It's a big day.

338
00:50:33,377 --> 00:50:35,012
We can ask Stilgar
to call it off.

339
00:50:35,046 --> 00:50:37,516
No. I'm fine.

340
00:50:53,565 --> 00:50:54,500
<i>Usul.</i>

341
00:50:57,335 --> 00:50:59,270
I tuned it myself.

342
00:51:01,405 --> 00:51:02,641
- Here.
- Thanks.

343
00:51:05,443 --> 00:51:09,280
Don't try to impress anyone.
You are brave. We all know that.

344
00:51:10,248 --> 00:51:12,618
Heh? Be simple.

345
00:51:12,651 --> 00:51:16,053
Be direct. Nothing fancy.

346
00:51:16,087 --> 00:51:18,222
- Nothing fancy.
- Hey, I'm serious.

347
00:51:18,256 --> 00:51:20,726
Nothing fancy or you will shame
my teaching.

348
00:51:20,759 --> 00:51:24,796
I won't shame you. I understand.

349
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:29,468
<i>Shai-Hulud</i> decides today if
you become Fremen, or if you die.

350
00:51:37,509 --> 00:51:38,610
Hey, <i>Muad'Dib!</i>

351
00:52:20,452 --> 00:52:21,453
Lower.

352
00:52:45,777 --> 00:52:48,179
Okay. Okay.

353
00:53:59,851 --> 00:54:04,388
Okay. Okay. Okay.

354
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:53,004
Okay.

355
00:55:10,622 --> 00:55:11,957
Okay. Okay!

356
00:55:36,848 --> 00:55:37,883
Come on!

357
00:55:48,827 --> 00:55:49,728
Whoa!

358
00:56:53,158 --> 00:56:54,459
You're a rider!

359
00:58:50,008 --> 00:58:52,544
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I know they do.

360
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,949
<i>Our task in the North
is nearly done.</i>

361
00:58:57,983 --> 00:58:59,718
<i>They believe in Paul.</i>

362
00:59:00,752 --> 00:59:02,988
<i>Now we go South.</i>

363
00:59:03,021 --> 00:59:06,691
<i>There are millions
of fundamentalists there.</i>

364
00:59:06,725 --> 00:59:09,060
<i>They will protect him
when he comes.</i>

365
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:15,900
<i>The</i> Kwisatz Haderach
<i>will be born in the South.</i>

366
00:59:29,914 --> 00:59:31,683
As long as I breathe.

367
00:59:36,121 --> 00:59:37,088
What's wrong?

368
00:59:43,161 --> 00:59:44,129
Chani.

369
00:59:44,162 --> 00:59:45,730
There will be trouble.

370
00:59:47,899 --> 00:59:49,167
What are you talking about?

371
00:59:53,004 --> 00:59:54,606
Chani, what do you mean?

372
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:55,974
The way they look at you.

373
00:59:57,342 --> 00:59:58,810
They worship you now.

374
01:00:01,713 --> 01:00:04,182
The Fedaykin,
they count your victories.

375
01:00:04,215 --> 01:00:06,818
They say you can see the future.

376
01:00:06,851 --> 01:00:08,620
Whisper, " <i>Lisan al-Gaib."</i>

377
01:00:09,888 --> 01:00:11,222
I'm no messiah.

378
01:00:13,992 --> 01:00:17,162
I'm a Fedaykin of Sietch Tabr.

379
01:00:17,195 --> 01:00:19,898
Yet, we have a Bene Gesserit
among us,

380
01:00:19,931 --> 01:00:21,266
fanning the flames
of your legend,

381
01:00:21,299 --> 01:00:22,834
saying you're the One.

382
01:00:44,289 --> 01:00:45,824
Mm.

383
01:00:50,261 --> 01:00:52,097
She says you should
be coming with us.

384
01:00:52,964 --> 01:00:54,032
You know I can't.

385
01:00:54,933 --> 01:00:56,367
She's asking why.

386
01:00:56,401 --> 01:00:58,369
Because I must continue
fighting in the North,

387
01:00:58,403 --> 01:01:00,605
to protect you down
there in the South.

388
01:01:02,373 --> 01:01:06,010
She says she can tell
when you lie.

389
01:01:06,044 --> 01:01:09,347
Tell her that's because our mother
keeps spreading dangerous tales.

390
01:01:16,955 --> 01:01:18,756
What is she saying now?

391
01:01:18,790 --> 01:01:21,192
She says you're blinded by love,

392
01:01:21,226 --> 01:01:23,394
and she reminds you that
you must reserve your hand

393
01:01:23,428 --> 01:01:25,263
for the most strategic alliance.

394
01:01:28,299 --> 01:01:31,269
She's also wondering why
you don't believe in who you are.

395
01:01:31,302 --> 01:01:32,670
I do believe.

396
01:01:32,704 --> 01:01:34,639
I believe I matter
to these people.

397
01:01:36,241 --> 01:01:38,243
And I believe I'm making
a difference in this war.

398
01:01:40,278 --> 01:01:42,013
We're nearly
at the gates of the city.

399
01:01:42,046 --> 01:01:44,916
- That's not what she means.
- I know what she means.

400
01:01:44,949 --> 01:01:47,285
Do you not think I also feel
the weight of the prophecy?

401
01:01:47,318 --> 01:01:49,287
It's not a prophecy.

402
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,022
It's a story that you
keep telling,

403
01:01:51,055 --> 01:01:53,091
but it's not their story,
it's yours.

404
01:01:53,124 --> 01:01:56,327
They deserve to be led
by one of their own.

405
01:01:56,361 --> 01:01:59,063
What your people did
to this world is heartbreaking.

406
01:01:59,097 --> 01:02:00,765
We gave them something
to hope for.

407
01:02:00,798 --> 01:02:02,300
That's not hope!

408
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:17,982
I'll be waiting for you.

409
01:02:19,417 --> 01:02:20,852
All of us.

410
01:02:20,885 --> 01:02:22,854
<i>All of us.</i>

411
01:03:04,229 --> 01:03:06,864
Those storms look bad.

412
01:03:53,945 --> 01:03:55,581
- How much?
- We lost...

413
01:03:55,614 --> 01:03:58,283
eighty percent of our last crop.

414
01:03:58,316 --> 01:04:02,186
My Lord Rabban, you should
not leave the security perimeter.

415
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:04,822
Security perimeter?
The rats are already inside.

416
01:04:04,856 --> 01:04:06,492
The Fremen Demon
might be with them.

417
01:04:06,525 --> 01:04:08,226
I hope so.

418
01:04:08,259 --> 01:04:08,893
We're tracking them, my Lord.

419
01:04:10,094 --> 01:04:12,897
Today, <i>Muad'Dib</i> dies!

420
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:56,140
Where is he?

421
01:04:56,174 --> 01:04:57,609
Still negative, my Lord.

422
01:04:57,643 --> 01:04:59,210
Why do I have to do
everything myself?

423
01:05:02,347 --> 01:05:03,414
Open range!

424
01:05:03,449 --> 01:05:04,949
Range open.

425
01:05:12,924 --> 01:05:14,460
Life. Delta, delta, delta.

426
01:05:35,714 --> 01:05:36,981
I've lost them.

427
01:05:42,387 --> 01:05:44,222
- Strike!
- Yes, my Lord.

428
01:06:50,789 --> 01:06:53,625
<i>Muad'Dib!</i>

429
01:06:53,659 --> 01:06:55,527
Show yourself!

430
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:30,462
<i>Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib!</i>

431
01:08:23,515 --> 01:08:25,651
For <i>Muad'Dib!</i>

432
01:08:38,296 --> 01:08:39,330
<i>Muad'Dib.</i>

433
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:45,704
Some new Fremen prophet?

434
01:08:45,737 --> 01:08:48,640
It's not the first time we've
had frictions with the Fremen.

435
01:08:48,674 --> 01:08:50,475
None of this magnitude.

436
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:56,280
So, my dear daughter...

437
01:08:57,549 --> 01:08:59,751
how would you deal
with this prophet?

438
01:09:06,157 --> 01:09:08,827
If this <i>Muad'Dib</i>
is a religious figure,

439
01:09:10,562 --> 01:09:12,330
you can't use direct force.

440
01:09:13,832 --> 01:09:17,268
Repression only makes
a religion flourish.

441
01:09:17,301 --> 01:09:19,370
You'll only end up
humiliating yourself.

442
01:09:19,403 --> 01:09:21,138
You underestimate my Sardaukar.

443
01:09:21,172 --> 01:09:23,842
You underestimate
the power of faith.

444
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:31,315
Her Highness proves once again
that she was my most acute student.

445
01:09:33,585 --> 01:09:36,455
- You'd send assassins?
- No.

446
01:09:36,488 --> 01:09:38,255
Prophets get stronger
when they die.

447
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:42,527
Let the conflict
on Arrakis turn into war.

448
01:09:42,561 --> 01:09:45,731
You then bring peace.
As a savior.

449
01:09:48,265 --> 01:09:50,201
You'd be a formidable empress.

450
01:09:54,539 --> 01:09:57,476
<i>Muad'Dib.</i> The prophet.

451
01:09:57,509 --> 01:10:00,177
The one who points the way.

452
01:10:00,211 --> 01:10:02,380
These are our own
religious patterns, aren't they?

453
01:10:02,413 --> 01:10:03,682
This is our doing.

454
01:10:07,351 --> 01:10:10,388
<i>Muad'Dib</i> means kangaroo mouse.

455
01:10:10,421 --> 01:10:12,323
An unusual war name
for a Fremen.

456
01:10:14,526 --> 01:10:17,629
- What if Paul Atreides were still alive?
- -Enough!

457
01:10:17,663 --> 01:10:21,800
This must not come out. Even
to your father's ears. Understand?

458
01:10:22,734 --> 01:10:25,671
I do, Reverend Mother.

459
01:10:25,704 --> 01:10:28,940
If Paul is alive,
he likely knows the truth.

460
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:30,909
And should
the Great Houses learn

461
01:10:30,942 --> 01:10:34,278
that your father was behind
the liquidation of the Atreides,

462
01:10:34,311 --> 01:10:37,649
your father will face war
and lose the throne.

463
01:10:39,618 --> 01:10:40,952
Then what hope is there?

464
01:10:42,487 --> 01:10:43,354
Hope?

465
01:10:44,823 --> 01:10:48,960
We are Bene Gesserit.
We don't hope, we plan.

466
01:10:50,327 --> 01:10:54,298
Paul is not our only prospect.

467
01:10:54,331 --> 01:10:59,336
The Baron's youngest nephew, Feyd-Rautha
Harkonnen, will inherit Arrakis.

468
01:11:00,872 --> 01:11:02,406
He may be the answer.

469
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,976
Feyd-Rautha? He's psychotic.

470
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:06,945
That's irrelevant.

471
01:11:06,978 --> 01:11:11,315
The question is,
can we control him?

472
01:11:11,348 --> 01:11:12,751
And I intend to find out.

473
01:11:36,074 --> 01:11:38,643
Would you like some fresh meat,
my darlings?

474
01:11:39,678 --> 01:11:42,814
Lungs? Or liver?

475
01:11:42,848 --> 01:11:45,917
What would you like?
I hear they're big today.

476
01:11:45,951 --> 01:11:50,421
Your new blades
for this very special day,

477
01:11:50,455 --> 01:11:53,290
na-Baron, Feyd-Rautha.

478
01:12:22,654 --> 01:12:23,655
-A notch off balance.

479
01:12:23,688 --> 01:12:24,421
It's the tip.

480
01:12:25,490 --> 01:12:26,925
Should be sharper.

481
01:12:41,139 --> 01:12:42,741
Come.

482
01:12:42,774 --> 01:12:44,810
I won't die like a fool.

483
01:12:44,843 --> 01:12:45,977
Kill me now.

484
01:12:46,011 --> 01:12:48,780
No drug for you today, Atreides.

485
01:14:04,122 --> 01:14:06,157
Welcome to Giedi Prime, sisters.

486
01:14:06,191 --> 01:14:08,460
I hope your travels
were agreeable.

487
01:14:08,493 --> 01:14:10,729
A long way to come
just to watch our prospect

488
01:14:10,762 --> 01:14:12,697
risk his life, Lady Fenring.

489
01:14:12,731 --> 01:14:14,766
No fear.

490
01:14:14,799 --> 01:14:16,501
These fights are all for show.

491
01:14:17,969 --> 01:14:20,572
But we'll get
a good look at him.

492
01:14:42,627 --> 01:14:46,531
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

493
01:16:00,905 --> 01:16:01,873
That slave isn't drugged.

494
01:16:02,974 --> 01:16:04,709
That bug is walking straight.

495
01:16:05,977 --> 01:16:07,212
You should cancel the fight.

496
01:16:07,245 --> 01:16:10,081
Don't spoil
my nephew's birthday.

497
01:16:57,695 --> 01:17:00,598
Happy birthday, dear nephew.

498
01:17:17,015 --> 01:17:18,983
Why do they not stop the fight?

499
01:17:19,017 --> 01:17:20,885
Plans within plans.

500
01:17:25,690 --> 01:17:27,092
Show me who you are.

501
01:17:44,075 --> 01:17:45,643
There he is.

502
01:18:30,221 --> 01:18:32,023
Back! Back!

503
01:18:49,874 --> 01:18:51,109
Stay back!

504
01:19:04,889 --> 01:19:07,125
You have fought well, Atreides.

505
01:19:08,226 --> 01:19:09,495
Hmm.

506
01:19:18,903 --> 01:19:23,241
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

507
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:30,248
He's impressive, indeed.

508
01:19:30,281 --> 01:19:34,152
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

509
01:19:42,126 --> 01:19:43,761
The slave wasn't drugged.

510
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:48,766
You tried to kill me.

511
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,169
This morning you were a playboy,

512
01:19:51,202 --> 01:19:53,104
feared and envied,

513
01:19:53,137 --> 01:19:56,441
but tonight you're a hero.

514
01:19:56,475 --> 01:19:58,209
My gift to you.

515
01:19:58,243 --> 01:20:00,245
I ought to drown you
in that tub.

516
01:20:01,813 --> 01:20:04,015
Don't be hasty.

517
01:20:04,048 --> 01:20:06,485
I have another gift for you.

518
01:20:06,518 --> 01:20:07,885
A bigger one.

519
01:20:09,387 --> 01:20:11,155
Arrakis.

520
01:20:14,926 --> 01:20:16,794
What about Rabban?

521
01:20:16,828 --> 01:20:19,097
He has failed
to protect spice production.

522
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:21,299
Rabban will be reassigned.

523
01:20:25,270 --> 01:20:28,172
Tame Arrakis, Feyd.

524
01:20:28,206 --> 01:20:30,808
Free the spice.
I'll make you Emperor.

525
01:20:43,121 --> 01:20:44,956
Emperor?

526
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:49,127
How?

527
01:20:51,262 --> 01:20:54,198
The Emperor helped me
destroy the Atreides.

528
01:20:55,534 --> 01:20:58,303
He lent his own army
to the cause.

529
01:20:58,336 --> 01:21:00,872
A serious crime.

530
01:21:00,905 --> 01:21:05,109
If it came to light, the Great
Houses would rise against him.

531
01:21:05,943 --> 01:21:07,145
And then...

532
01:21:08,413 --> 01:21:10,848
who will sit on the throne?

533
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:14,852
Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen.

534
01:21:55,093 --> 01:21:56,227
You're following me.

535
01:21:57,596 --> 01:21:58,630
Am I?

536
01:22:00,599 --> 01:22:02,133
I may have gotten lost.

537
01:22:04,302 --> 01:22:09,006
Will you show me the way out
of this maze, my Lord na-Baron?

538
01:22:16,247 --> 01:22:18,416
We've met, haven't we?

539
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:22,987
I don't think so.

540
01:22:23,955 --> 01:22:26,357
I'm Lady Margot Fenring.

541
01:22:26,391 --> 01:22:28,694
I'm here to honor
your coming of age.

542
01:22:28,727 --> 01:22:30,496
You're not allowed
in this section.

543
01:22:31,630 --> 01:22:33,231
How did you get past the guards?

544
01:22:33,264 --> 01:22:34,466
The guards?

545
01:22:37,435 --> 01:22:39,337
May I ask,
what are you doing here?

546
01:22:41,607 --> 01:22:45,042
You're not taking part
in your own celebrations?

547
01:22:55,386 --> 01:22:58,222
You're Bene Gesserit.

548
01:22:58,256 --> 01:23:01,125
And what makes you say that?

549
01:23:01,159 --> 01:23:03,629
I remember now.

550
01:23:03,662 --> 01:23:06,364
I dreamed about you last night.

551
01:23:06,397 --> 01:23:08,099
<i>A pleasant dream, I hope.</i>

552
01:23:08,132 --> 01:23:09,635
Don't mock me, woman.

553
01:23:09,668 --> 01:23:11,002
<i>I wouldn't dare.</i>

554
01:23:13,337 --> 01:23:16,340
I know your
Bene Gesserit tricks.

555
01:23:16,374 --> 01:23:18,644
And what do you know
about the Bene Gesserit?

556
01:23:22,548 --> 01:23:23,414
Tell me.

557
01:23:27,653 --> 01:23:29,253
Something wrong?

558
01:23:29,287 --> 01:23:30,589
I don't recognize this place.

559
01:23:31,790 --> 01:23:33,459
This is the guest wing.

560
01:23:36,327 --> 01:23:37,428
Where are you going?

561
01:23:39,330 --> 01:23:40,298
To my room.

562
01:24:07,526 --> 01:24:12,997
Come. To. Me.

563
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:17,401
Kneel.

564
01:24:31,550 --> 01:24:34,418
Put your right hand in the box.

565
01:24:49,635 --> 01:24:53,070
A sociopath.
Of high intelligence.

566
01:24:53,104 --> 01:24:55,106
Driven. Cruel.

567
01:24:55,139 --> 01:24:57,208
But strongly motivated by honor.

568
01:24:58,342 --> 01:25:00,479
He yearns to be hurt.

569
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:02,446
He loves pain.

570
01:25:02,481 --> 01:25:04,081
Can he be redeemed?

571
01:25:04,115 --> 01:25:05,584
He can be controlled.

572
01:25:05,617 --> 01:25:07,385
He's sexually vulnerable.

573
01:25:09,555 --> 01:25:10,421
And?

574
01:25:11,890 --> 01:25:13,559
The bloodline is secured.

575
01:25:15,326 --> 01:25:18,162
Female, as you requested.

576
01:25:19,196 --> 01:25:21,533
You did well, Margot.

577
01:25:21,567 --> 01:25:24,770
Respectfully, why didn't you
test him yourself?

578
01:25:26,237 --> 01:25:28,674
I'm a motherly figure.

579
01:25:28,707 --> 01:25:32,310
And based on what happened
between him and his own mother,

580
01:25:32,343 --> 01:25:34,880
I didn't expect to be effective.

581
01:25:34,913 --> 01:25:36,515
What happened between
him and his mother?

582
01:25:37,315 --> 01:25:38,182
He murdered her.

583
01:25:39,618 --> 01:25:42,588
Desire and humiliation.

584
01:25:43,855 --> 01:25:46,458
Those are his levers.

585
01:25:46,491 --> 01:25:48,860
If Feyd-Rautha
prevails on Arrakis,

586
01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:51,597
we shall know
how to control him.

587
01:26:12,484 --> 01:26:14,786
Rid me of this Fremen Demon.

588
01:26:29,835 --> 01:26:33,437
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

589
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:37,776
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

590
01:26:37,809 --> 01:26:39,478
Feyd-Rautha!

01:27:27,559 --> 01:27:28,794
Juicy?

599
01:27:28,827 --> 01:27:30,662
Juicy, juicy.

600
01:27:33,364 --> 01:27:34,966
Well, it was nice knowing ya.

601
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,501
Oh, yeah?

602
01:27:36,535 --> 01:27:38,269
Radar's clear. We're clear.

603
01:27:39,671 --> 01:27:41,173
Cooking time.

604
01:28:00,992 --> 01:28:02,761
Juicy, juicy.

605
01:28:02,794 --> 01:28:04,763
Yeah, I got a meter reading...

606
01:28:04,796 --> 01:28:06,798
All right, guys,
worms are on their way.

607
01:28:06,832 --> 01:28:07,899
- Watch out for abrasions.
- -Get ready to dock.

608
01:28:07,933 --> 01:28:09,300
It's gonna get hot.

609
01:28:13,437 --> 01:28:15,372
Crank 'em up! Throw them up!

610
01:28:44,102 --> 01:28:45,036
Hold!

611
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:00,952
Mine! Mine!

612
01:29:00,986 --> 01:29:02,721
Get moving!

613
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:08,994
- East! East!
- Get clear!

614
01:29:15,634 --> 01:29:17,569
Let's get out of here!

615
01:29:17,602 --> 01:29:18,970
Incoming!

616
01:29:22,406 --> 01:29:24,042
Don't run, fight!

617
01:29:25,844 --> 01:29:27,813
We're in deep Fremen shit.

618
01:29:29,881 --> 01:29:31,382
Holy Mother.

619
01:29:42,561 --> 01:29:43,695
Oh, fuck.

620
01:30:00,679 --> 01:30:03,515
I recognized your footsteps...

621
01:30:03,548 --> 01:30:05,116
- old man.
- No.

622
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:31,610
You young pup.

623
01:30:32,177 --> 01:30:34,045
You young pup!

624
01:30:41,119 --> 01:30:43,855
Mmm.
After the Battle of Arrakeen,

625
01:30:43,889 --> 01:30:47,391
I was able to negotiate a trip
back home for the survivors.

626
01:30:48,627 --> 01:30:50,662
Thanks to these guys.

627
01:30:50,695 --> 01:30:51,897
Why'd you stay?

628
01:30:52,931 --> 01:30:54,398
Well, I wanted blood.

629
01:30:56,601 --> 01:30:57,702
Rabban's head?

630
01:30:58,837 --> 01:31:00,805
Mm-hmm.

631
01:31:00,839 --> 01:31:03,942
Well, since <i>Muad'Dib's</i>
been driving Rabban crazy,

632
01:31:03,975 --> 01:31:08,847
the smuggling business
has been quite profitable.

633
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,682
Gurney Halleck the smuggler.

634
01:31:12,851 --> 01:31:15,186
Paul <i>Muad'Dib.</i>

635
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:17,923
I've heard many stories
about <i>Muad'Dib.</i>

636
01:31:19,024 --> 01:31:20,592
None of them pretty.

637
01:31:21,826 --> 01:31:23,128
You see the fear?

638
01:31:24,930 --> 01:31:26,765
When our resources
are limited...

639
01:31:29,567 --> 01:31:31,069
fear is all we have.

640
01:31:48,787 --> 01:31:50,255
How many men with you?

641
01:31:50,288 --> 01:31:52,490
- Two hundred.
- Two hundred?

642
01:31:57,062 --> 01:31:59,998
Do you realize what you're able
to achieve with 200 men?

643
01:32:01,299 --> 01:32:03,034
Incredible fighters.

644
01:32:03,068 --> 01:32:04,602
Duncan said there
were millions of them.

645
01:32:04,636 --> 01:32:06,237
In the Deep South, yes.

646
01:32:06,271 --> 01:32:08,707
Well, what are you waiting for?

647
01:32:08,740 --> 01:32:11,943
With thousands of these guys, you
could take control of the entire planet.

648
01:32:11,977 --> 01:32:14,012
It's your father's dream.
What are you afraid of?

649
01:32:14,045 --> 01:32:15,046
Hey!

650
01:32:17,148 --> 01:32:18,850
Worship, Gurney.

651
01:32:20,151 --> 01:32:21,486
They used to be friends.

652
01:32:23,121 --> 01:32:24,556
Now they're followers.

653
01:32:24,589 --> 01:32:26,658
<i>Muad'Dib,</i> the Prophet.

654
01:32:26,691 --> 01:32:28,626
Why is that a bad thing? Use it.

655
01:32:28,660 --> 01:32:30,795
It's not that simple.

656
01:32:30,829 --> 01:32:33,631
You have the power to avenge
your father, and you're afraid to use it?

657
01:32:33,665 --> 01:32:35,667
Spice opened my mind, Gurney.

658
01:32:36,634 --> 01:32:37,969
I can foresee things.

659
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:43,908
If I go South, all my visions
lead to horror.

660
01:32:43,942 --> 01:32:47,245
Billions of corpses
scattered across the galaxy.

661
01:32:47,278 --> 01:32:48,780
All dying because of me.

662
01:32:49,814 --> 01:32:50,949
Because you lose control.

663
01:32:53,018 --> 01:32:54,085
Because I gain it.

664
01:33:12,971 --> 01:33:14,139
That's a lot of water.

665
01:33:16,908 --> 01:33:18,243
Chani.

666
01:33:18,276 --> 01:33:19,978
What?
Look at him, he's hopeless.

667
01:33:20,845 --> 01:33:21,780
He's family.

668
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:26,251
Really?

669
01:33:54,312 --> 01:33:56,815
No need to be a prophet
to see what's ahead.

670
01:33:59,751 --> 01:34:01,086
Your path leads to war.

671
01:34:02,854 --> 01:34:03,922
You know that.

672
01:34:06,324 --> 01:34:08,693
So, war is coming.

673
01:34:08,726 --> 01:34:12,297
What will you do when you feel
its breath upon your neck?

674
01:34:16,034 --> 01:34:18,303
If you don't want to raise
an army in the South,

675
01:34:18,336 --> 01:34:19,971
you may still have an option.

676
01:34:23,308 --> 01:34:24,342
Fire power...

677
01:34:26,077 --> 01:34:27,745
which you don't have.

678
01:34:29,914 --> 01:34:30,882
And here I am.

679
01:34:35,353 --> 01:34:37,889
I know where your father
hid the family atomics.

680
01:34:43,294 --> 01:34:46,097
Every House possesses
an atomic arsenal.

681
01:34:47,466 --> 01:34:49,400
I thought ours had been lost.

682
01:34:51,870 --> 01:34:54,239
It's huge, Chani.
It could change everything.

683
01:34:59,711 --> 01:35:02,881
I could aim the bombs
at the main spice fields.

684
01:35:04,849 --> 01:35:08,052
He who can destroy a thing
has the real control of it.

685
01:35:09,787 --> 01:35:11,222
So, you can control it
and not us?

686
01:35:13,492 --> 01:35:15,293
You promised me
you didn't want power.

687
01:35:17,195 --> 01:35:19,197
No matter what I do,
you still don't trust me.

688
01:35:19,230 --> 01:35:22,000
'Cause you're a foreigner.
Like your friend.

689
01:35:24,335 --> 01:35:25,937
I'm not a foreigner.

690
01:35:33,745 --> 01:35:35,013
Not to me.

691
01:35:35,046 --> 01:35:36,714
But to the desert, you are.

692
01:35:37,815 --> 01:35:39,817
My allegiance is to you.

693
01:35:40,486 --> 01:35:41,886
To the Fremen.

694
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:43,721
I'm doing this for all of us.

695
01:35:45,190 --> 01:35:46,057
Do you believe me?

696
01:35:54,799 --> 01:35:55,867
I'll talk to Stilgar.

697
01:36:03,975 --> 01:36:04,976
There.

698
01:36:09,214 --> 01:36:12,417
It's right under
everybody's noses.

699
01:36:13,885 --> 01:36:15,153
Not clever.

700
01:36:15,186 --> 01:36:16,955
That's the idea.

701
01:36:16,988 --> 01:36:19,190
Nobody would ever look in there
because it's obvious.

702
01:36:21,859 --> 01:36:23,828
Not clever.

703
01:36:23,861 --> 01:36:25,330
Did you find it?

704
01:36:25,363 --> 01:36:27,533
I didn't look for it.

705
01:36:27,566 --> 01:36:29,033
How many heads exactly?

706
01:36:30,902 --> 01:36:32,837
Enough to blow up
the whole planet.

707
01:36:35,907 --> 01:36:37,275
It's a figure of speech.

708
01:36:39,177 --> 01:36:40,211
You know what I mean.

709
01:37:02,967 --> 01:37:04,902
Only with your genetic heritage.

710
01:37:44,576 --> 01:37:48,279
Your great-great-grandfather's
legacy.

711
01:37:48,313 --> 01:37:52,016
The 92 original Atreides
family's atomic warheads.

712
01:37:54,952 --> 01:37:58,122
Now that, that is power.

713
01:38:04,996 --> 01:38:09,200
Imperial Diary. Year 10,191.

714
01:38:09,233 --> 01:38:11,503
Eighth comment.

715
01:38:11,537 --> 01:38:15,406
Reports from the south
of Arrakis arrive rarely.

716
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:19,143
<i>These are barren, burnt lands
hidden by sandstorms</i>

717
01:38:19,177 --> 01:38:21,446
<i>which stretch a thousand miles
across the equator.</i>

718
01:38:23,448 --> 01:38:27,385
<i>Nothing can live there
without faith.</i>

719
01:38:27,418 --> 01:38:31,490
<i>Which is why our Bene Gesserit
missionaries have been so productive there.</i>

720
01:38:35,026 --> 01:38:37,995
<i>Through them, we are receiving
reports of a mysterious figure</i>

721
01:38:38,029 --> 01:38:39,897
<i>taking grip on the imaginations</i>

722
01:38:39,931 --> 01:38:43,301
<i>of the Southern
fundamentalist tribes.</i>

723
01:38:43,334 --> 01:38:46,971
<i>A new Reverend Mother
from the North...</i>

724
01:38:47,004 --> 01:38:51,109
<i>spreading word of the imminent
arrival of the</i> Lisan al-Gaib,

725
01:38:51,142 --> 01:38:54,212
<i>"The Voice
from the Outer World."</i>

726
01:38:54,245 --> 01:38:57,516
<i>With religious fervor
rising in the South,</i>

727
01:38:57,549 --> 01:39:01,352
<i>and</i> Muad'Dib <i>strangling
spice production in the North,</i>

728
01:39:01,386 --> 01:39:04,889
<i>everything points
to the escalation of war.</i>

729
01:39:24,643 --> 01:39:25,511
Hmm.

730
01:39:35,286 --> 01:39:36,154
Quiet.

731
01:41:25,196 --> 01:41:26,798
Listen carefully.

732
01:41:26,832 --> 01:41:28,534
Soon a man
is going to visit your temple

733
01:41:28,567 --> 01:41:31,302
and he may want
you to perform the rites.

734
01:41:31,335 --> 01:41:34,272
Reverend Mother,
it is forbidden.

735
01:41:39,611 --> 01:41:41,445
Let him try!

736
01:42:25,557 --> 01:42:26,725
What the hell?

737
01:42:30,328 --> 01:42:31,563
Chani!

738
01:42:37,536 --> 01:42:38,837
Chani!

739
01:42:42,908 --> 01:42:44,175
Chani.

740
01:42:53,852 --> 01:42:55,554
Sietch Tabr.

741
01:43:19,845 --> 01:43:21,546
Old fashioned artillery.

742
01:43:22,681 --> 01:43:24,616
Genius.

743
01:43:24,650 --> 01:43:27,486
We're literally melting rock
on their heads.

744
01:43:27,519 --> 01:43:30,555
I want to go on the ground.
Prepare my troops.

745
01:43:30,589 --> 01:43:33,759
My Lord. I would recommend
you stay inside. There was...

746
01:43:33,792 --> 01:43:35,727
Bring his body to my quarters.

747
01:43:36,895 --> 01:43:39,230
My poor darlings are hungry.

748
01:43:39,263 --> 01:43:40,932
There was no food
for them on the flight.

749
01:43:42,534 --> 01:43:44,970
What are you doing here?

750
01:43:45,003 --> 01:43:48,239
It's early morning.
What are you doing here?

751
01:43:48,272 --> 01:43:49,941
Kiss my feet, brother.

752
01:43:49,975 --> 01:43:51,242
I'm gonna eviscerate your...

753
01:43:57,248 --> 01:43:59,718
You humiliated our family.

754
01:44:00,852 --> 01:44:02,621
You humiliated me.

755
01:44:03,622 --> 01:44:04,990
Kiss...

756
01:44:05,023 --> 01:44:06,825
or die.

757
01:44:17,301 --> 01:44:18,402
We're even now.

758
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:27,211
Embarrass our family
one more time...

759
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:29,648
it will be the last.

760
01:45:04,616 --> 01:45:07,052
They didn't even
engage on the ground,

761
01:45:07,085 --> 01:45:09,454
like honorable fighters.

762
01:45:41,787 --> 01:45:44,823
<i>Usul,</i> in the South...

763
01:45:44,856 --> 01:45:47,358
only leaders
are allowed to speak.

764
01:45:48,660 --> 01:45:51,530
- You must take my place.
- I can't do that.

765
01:45:51,563 --> 01:45:54,466
It is a good time
to cross blades with me.

766
01:45:54,499 --> 01:45:57,803
I am weak.
I am an easy kill, <i>Muad'Dib.</i>

767
01:45:57,836 --> 01:45:59,805
I'd rather cut off my own hand.

768
01:45:59,838 --> 01:46:02,574
We need you. We need the
<i>Lisan al-Gaib</i> to lead our people.

769
01:46:02,607 --> 01:46:04,543
You know what I think
of all that, Stilgar.

770
01:46:04,576 --> 01:46:06,978
I don't care what you believe.
I believe.

771
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:22,828
I didn't see it coming.

772
01:46:24,729 --> 01:46:26,464
The Harkonnens aren't done here.

773
01:46:27,566 --> 01:46:29,701
They just went back to reload.

774
01:46:29,734 --> 01:46:31,603
We're setting thumpers.

775
01:46:31,636 --> 01:46:32,971
We're moving everyone
to the South.

776
01:46:33,004 --> 01:46:34,906
I'll stay behind
and cover your retreat.

777
01:46:34,940 --> 01:46:37,374
- What are you talking about?
- Chani, I can't go with you.

778
01:46:38,043 --> 01:46:39,644
You know why.

779
01:46:39,678 --> 01:46:41,680
- I'll stay, too.
- Nobody stays but me.

780
01:46:41,713 --> 01:46:44,149
- Paul.
- That's an order, Gurney Halleck! Go South!

781
01:46:44,182 --> 01:46:45,550
Protect my mother.

782
01:46:47,986 --> 01:46:49,120
- My Lord.
<i>- Muad'Dib.</i>

783
01:46:59,164 --> 01:47:00,999
He's afraid of the fundamentalists.

784
01:47:02,534 --> 01:47:03,535
And he should be.

785
01:47:16,982 --> 01:47:18,382
<i>Don't resist.</i>

786
01:47:25,624 --> 01:47:27,092
Talk to me, Jamis.

787
01:47:37,969 --> 01:47:42,140
<i>You see only fragments.</i>

788
01:47:42,173 --> 01:47:46,111
<i>You cannot see the future
without seeing the past.</i>

789
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:52,918
<i>To unlock your mind, you
need to drink the Water of Life...</i>

790
01:47:52,951 --> 01:47:55,887
<i>and you will see everything.</i>

791
01:47:59,591 --> 01:48:02,994
<i>A good hunter always climbs
the highest dune before his hunt.</i>

792
01:48:04,596 --> 01:48:05,764
<i>He needs to see...</i>

793
01:48:07,732 --> 01:48:09,200
<i>as far as he can see.</i>

794
01:48:14,606 --> 01:48:15,740
You need to see.

795
01:48:18,610 --> 01:48:20,645
<i>You must drink
the Water of Life.</i>

796
01:48:21,947 --> 01:48:23,648
<i>Your mind, it's gonna open,</i>

797
01:48:25,884 --> 01:48:27,585
<i>and you will see.</i>

798
01:48:45,971 --> 01:48:47,906
The world has made choices for us.

799
01:48:53,011 --> 01:48:54,779
If I go South, I might lose you.

800
01:48:54,813 --> 01:48:56,581
You will never lose me,

801
01:48:57,882 --> 01:48:59,050
Paul Atreides.

802
01:49:00,952 --> 01:49:03,254
Not as long as you stay who you are.

803
01:49:10,862 --> 01:49:12,864
I'll cross the storms with you.

804
01:49:12,897 --> 01:49:14,165
Go South.

805
01:49:15,567 --> 01:49:17,035
Bring your people to safety.

806
01:49:23,174 --> 01:49:25,877
And then I will do
what must be done.

807
01:49:50,035 --> 01:49:51,202
Where?

808
01:49:51,236 --> 01:49:53,805
Spy. Left behind.

809
01:49:53,838 --> 01:49:55,740
No trace of the others.

810
01:49:55,774 --> 01:49:58,243
They've gone South
to hide in the storms.

811
01:50:03,081 --> 01:50:04,816
Send this message to the Baron.

812
01:50:04,849 --> 01:50:07,152
The North is liberated
and secured.

813
01:50:07,185 --> 01:50:09,721
Harvest spice at will.

814
01:50:09,754 --> 01:50:11,089
Yes, na-Baron.

815
01:50:25,837 --> 01:50:29,207
You killed nine of my men
with one single blade.

816
01:50:30,775 --> 01:50:32,610
She won't talk.

817
01:50:32,644 --> 01:50:34,612
Tell her that's fine.

818
01:50:34,646 --> 01:50:36,881
I already know
everything I need to know.

819
01:50:44,889 --> 01:50:46,724
Only pleasure remains.

820
01:52:52,083 --> 01:52:55,987
<i>Now that you can see our past,</i>

821
01:52:59,257 --> 01:53:02,327
<i>you can see your future.</i>

822
01:53:23,348 --> 01:53:27,218
<i>Oh, brother, my dearest brother,</i>

823
01:53:27,252 --> 01:53:30,054
<i>you are not prepared
for what is to come.</i>

824
01:53:31,889 --> 01:53:35,193
<i>You'll now learn the truth
about our family.</i>

825
01:53:35,226 --> 01:53:38,796
<i>And it will hurt you
to the core.</i>

826
01:53:40,331 --> 01:53:42,300
Paul...

827
01:53:42,333 --> 01:53:45,403
<i>Don't worry. I'm with you.</i>

828
01:53:46,938 --> 01:53:48,306
I love you.

829
01:54:01,453 --> 01:54:02,854
Find them.

830
01:54:32,283 --> 01:54:33,284
Paul?

831
01:54:34,052 --> 01:54:35,086
Paul.

832
01:54:37,322 --> 01:54:39,924
I'm here. I'm here. Hey.

833
01:54:43,328 --> 01:54:44,596
What happened?

834
01:54:46,164 --> 01:54:47,466
What happened?

835
01:54:58,109 --> 01:54:59,645
He's dead.

836
01:54:59,678 --> 01:55:02,413
His vital signs are so low,
they can't be detected.

837
01:55:02,447 --> 01:55:03,915
But he's alive.

838
01:55:03,948 --> 01:55:05,450
What did you do to him?

839
01:55:06,918 --> 01:55:09,020
No, not that.
Why would he do that?

840
01:55:09,053 --> 01:55:10,121
Why would you do that?

841
01:55:19,197 --> 01:55:22,601
Chani, his body is fighting the
poison and he needs your help.

842
01:55:22,634 --> 01:55:24,035
You do it.

843
01:55:25,203 --> 01:55:26,304
You did this to him.

844
01:55:26,337 --> 01:55:28,005
You did this to your own son!

845
01:55:28,039 --> 01:55:29,107
You do it!

846
01:55:29,140 --> 01:55:31,142
Fix it yourself.

847
01:55:31,175 --> 01:55:34,546
Chani, you might not believe in
the prophecy, but you're a part of it.

848
01:55:34,580 --> 01:55:36,280
You're the poison.

849
01:55:36,314 --> 01:55:39,016
You and your lies.
Why would you do this?

850
01:55:39,050 --> 01:55:40,218
Do it.

851
01:56:04,743 --> 01:56:06,177
Desert Spring tears.

852
01:56:30,469 --> 01:56:33,705
<i>Kwisatz Haderach,</i>

853
01:56:33,739 --> 01:56:37,676
<i>climb up. Arise.</i>

854
01:56:47,351 --> 01:56:49,153
<i>Usul,</i> I'm here. I'm here.

855
01:56:58,497 --> 01:57:00,198
Are you okay?

856
01:57:00,231 --> 01:57:01,232
Yes.

857
01:57:10,341 --> 01:57:11,477
Are you sure?

858
01:57:15,547 --> 01:57:16,981
Thanks to you.

859
01:58:02,628 --> 01:58:04,228
I'm sorry about Chani.

860
01:58:05,731 --> 01:58:07,633
She'll come to understand.

861
01:58:08,534 --> 01:58:09,768
I've seen it.

862
01:58:11,402 --> 01:58:13,371
You can see?

863
01:58:13,404 --> 01:58:15,674
The visions are clear now.

864
01:58:17,843 --> 01:58:21,647
I see possible futures.
All at once.

865
01:58:22,814 --> 01:58:26,350
Our enemies are all around us.

866
01:58:26,384 --> 01:58:28,720
And in so many futures,
they prevail.

867
01:58:29,655 --> 01:58:31,523
But I do see a way.

868
01:58:32,724 --> 01:58:35,126
There is a narrow way through.

869
01:58:45,403 --> 01:58:47,238
I saw our bloodline, Mother.

870
01:58:48,507 --> 01:58:49,841
Written across time.

871
01:59:02,521 --> 01:59:05,323
<i>You are the daughter
of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.</i>

872
01:59:08,225 --> 01:59:09,628
Did my father know?

873
01:59:15,667 --> 01:59:18,837
I didn't know myself,
until I took the worm's poison.

874
01:59:26,712 --> 01:59:28,346
We're Harkonnens.

875
01:59:32,416 --> 01:59:34,486
So this is how we'll survive.

876
01:59:36,253 --> 01:59:37,689
By being Harkonnens.

877
02:01:14,720 --> 02:01:15,754
We must talk.

878
02:01:17,789 --> 02:01:20,692
Stilgar, you can stop this.
Do you hear me?

879
02:01:20,726 --> 02:01:22,426
You have the power to stop this.

880
02:01:22,461 --> 02:01:23,929
Northern woman!

881
02:01:23,962 --> 02:01:25,831
You are not allowed
to speak inside the circle.

882
02:01:25,864 --> 02:01:27,532
If you want to speak,
you know what to do.

883
02:01:27,566 --> 02:01:30,769
Stilgar, please.
For Arrakis' sake.

884
02:01:43,482 --> 02:01:46,417
This prophecy
is how they enslave us!

885
02:01:46,450 --> 02:01:48,553
How they dominate...

886
02:01:48,587 --> 02:01:50,387
You'll get yourself in trouble.

887
02:01:50,421 --> 02:01:51,857
This is none of your business.

888
02:01:51,890 --> 02:01:53,892
Rabban Harkonnen himself
killed my family.

889
02:01:53,925 --> 02:01:55,894
He gave me this scar
to remember him by.

890
02:01:55,927 --> 02:01:57,963
This is all of my business.

891
02:02:44,976 --> 02:02:47,078
Only tribe leaders can speak.

892
02:02:47,112 --> 02:02:49,413
If you wish to share your voice,

893
02:02:49,446 --> 02:02:52,383
you must take his place
by defeating him

894
02:02:52,416 --> 02:02:54,820
and returning his water
to the well.

895
02:02:54,853 --> 02:02:58,422
You think I'm stupid enough to
deprive myself of the best of us?

896
02:03:02,661 --> 02:03:04,796
Take my life, <i>Usul.</i>

897
02:03:04,830 --> 02:03:06,865
It is the only way.

898
02:03:06,898 --> 02:03:08,834
I'm pointing the way!

899
02:03:11,036 --> 02:03:12,571
Slow down.

900
02:03:48,139 --> 02:03:50,374
But you think
you could have a chance.

901
02:04:34,252 --> 02:04:35,887
Dune.

902
02:04:35,921 --> 02:04:37,555
<i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

903
02:04:37,589 --> 02:04:39,858
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

904
02:04:41,159 --> 02:04:42,594
<i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

905
02:04:53,772 --> 02:04:54,839
<i>Muad'Dib!</i>

906
02:04:54,873 --> 02:04:56,741
<i>Muad'Dib.</i>

907
02:05:21,099 --> 02:05:23,168
This is my father's
ducal signet.

908
02:05:33,545 --> 02:05:36,147
I am Paul <i>Muad'Dib</i> Atreides,

909
02:05:36,181 --> 02:05:38,016
Duke of Arrakis.

910
02:05:47,292 --> 02:05:49,027
<i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

911
02:05:49,060 --> 02:05:51,162
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

912
02:05:51,196 --> 02:05:55,533
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

913
02:05:55,567 --> 02:05:58,269
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

914
02:05:58,303 --> 02:06:01,272
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

915
02:06:01,306 --> 02:06:04,576
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

916
02:06:04,609 --> 02:06:07,779
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

917
02:06:07,812 --> 02:06:09,247
<i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

918
02:06:46,785 --> 02:06:49,054
Paul Atreides is still alive.

919
02:06:50,822 --> 02:06:52,323
He challenges my father.

920
02:06:53,792 --> 02:06:55,560
You've never been on Arrakis.

921
02:06:57,028 --> 02:06:59,030
It's quite impressive.
You'll see.

922
02:06:59,064 --> 02:07:00,665
Was this all upon your advice?

923
02:07:00,698 --> 02:07:02,734
What?

924
02:07:02,767 --> 02:07:05,804
Did you counsel my father
to exterminate the Atreides?

925
02:07:05,837 --> 02:07:09,174
Of course I did. Why else
would it have happened?

926
02:07:09,207 --> 02:07:11,643
You tried to sacrifice
an entire bloodline.

927
02:07:11,676 --> 02:07:13,745
And I was right to do it.

928
02:07:13,778 --> 02:07:16,915
The <i>Kwisatz Haderach</i>
is a form of power

929
02:07:16,948 --> 02:07:19,184
that our world has not yet seen.

930
02:07:19,217 --> 02:07:21,820
The ultimate power.

931
02:07:21,853 --> 02:07:23,688
For ninety generations,

932
02:07:23,721 --> 02:07:25,757
we have supervised
House Atreides.

933
02:07:25,790 --> 02:07:28,860
They were promising, but they
were becoming dangerously defiant.

934
02:07:28,893 --> 02:07:32,330
Their bloodline
had to be terminated.

935
02:07:32,363 --> 02:07:34,833
That is why we have put
many bloodlines at work.

936
02:07:34,866 --> 02:07:35,900
Several prospects.

937
02:07:35,934 --> 02:07:37,368
But it's backfired.

938
02:07:37,402 --> 02:07:39,104
Paul is alive.

939
02:07:39,137 --> 02:07:41,072
And if he defeats
Feyd-Rautha, my father...

940
02:07:41,106 --> 02:07:45,310
Your father will lose the
throne no matter who prevails.

941
02:07:45,343 --> 02:07:48,346
But there is one way your
family can remain in power

942
02:07:48,379 --> 02:07:51,816
and, through you, the
continuation of our stewardship.

943
02:07:52,917 --> 02:07:54,786
One. Way.

944
02:07:55,386 --> 02:07:57,889
Are you prepared?

945
02:07:57,922 --> 02:08:00,625
You've been preparing me
my whole life, Reverend Mother.

946
02:08:02,927 --> 02:08:05,230
You're heading north
with the others?

947
02:08:05,263 --> 02:08:07,198
I'm Fedaykin.

948
02:08:07,232 --> 02:08:09,934
I follow my leaders. If
fighting goes north, I go north.

949
02:08:09,968 --> 02:08:11,336
Paul didn't have
a choice, Chani.

950
02:08:11,369 --> 02:08:14,005
I won't be fighting for him.

951
02:08:14,038 --> 02:08:15,340
I'm fighting for my people.

952
02:08:19,210 --> 02:08:21,045
I came to wish you best of luck.

953
02:08:22,313 --> 02:08:23,882
I'd wish you the same,

954
02:08:25,850 --> 02:08:27,418
but it seems
you've won your battle.

955
02:08:50,742 --> 02:08:52,043
He took the bait.

956
02:08:58,783 --> 02:09:00,718
Oh, the Emperor's very obliging.

957
02:09:01,753 --> 02:09:03,321
He's right on time.

958
02:09:36,421 --> 02:09:38,790
What is he doing here?

959
02:09:38,823 --> 02:09:40,925
I brought spice production
under control.

960
02:09:44,095 --> 02:09:45,263
What do we do?

961
02:09:46,831 --> 02:09:49,535
Send messages
to the Great Houses.

962
02:09:49,568 --> 02:09:53,805
Tell them that Arrakis
is under Sardaukar attack.

963
02:09:53,838 --> 02:09:56,508
Tell them, their future
hangs in the balance.

964
02:10:23,868 --> 02:10:26,371
When the storm hits this ridge,

965
02:10:26,404 --> 02:10:28,873
Gurney will open
the way for you, Stilgar,

966
02:10:28,906 --> 02:10:31,175
so you can enter
the basin from the West

967
02:10:31,209 --> 02:10:33,545
and distract
their defense systems.

968
02:10:33,579 --> 02:10:35,380
Chani, I want you
and your Fedaykin

969
02:10:35,413 --> 02:10:36,914
to then attack from the East,

970
02:10:37,882 --> 02:10:39,917
inside the basin.

971
02:10:39,951 --> 02:10:42,053
I'll strike from the
North, head on,

972
02:10:42,086 --> 02:10:44,155
with the Fundamentalist troops.

973
02:10:44,188 --> 02:10:47,025
And I'll serve Arrakeen
for dessert.

974
02:10:47,058 --> 02:10:49,227
Remember,
I need the Emperor alive.

975
02:11:49,488 --> 02:11:50,489
Hm.

976
02:11:58,630 --> 02:12:01,132
Baron,

977
02:12:01,165 --> 02:12:06,003
do you have any idea
who this <i>Muad'Dib</i> could be?

978
02:12:06,037 --> 02:12:09,006
Some fanatic, your Majesty.
That's all we know.

979
02:12:09,040 --> 02:12:11,042
More. More. Give me more.

980
02:12:11,075 --> 02:12:12,176
He's a madman!

981
02:12:12,210 --> 02:12:14,212
- Mad?
- All Fremen are mad.

982
02:12:16,582 --> 02:12:18,617
That's all you know?

983
02:12:18,650 --> 02:12:20,619
Really?

984
02:12:20,652 --> 02:12:22,387
<i>Muad'Dib</i> is dead.

985
02:12:24,690 --> 02:12:27,693
Or he went hiding
in the Southern storms

986
02:12:27,726 --> 02:12:29,394
which means the same thing.

987
02:12:30,395 --> 02:12:31,697
Your Majesty,

988
02:12:31,730 --> 02:12:33,264
the sand storm
that's approaching

989
02:12:33,297 --> 02:12:35,701
threatens the integrity
of our shields.

990
02:12:35,734 --> 02:12:37,935
We recommend
going back into orbit.

991
02:12:37,969 --> 02:12:39,937
Well, the mountains will
protect us from most of it,

992
02:12:40,972 --> 02:12:42,173
your Majesty.

993
02:12:43,975 --> 02:12:48,112
Baron, have you
ever investigated

994
02:12:48,146 --> 02:12:51,483
the south regions of Arrakis?

995
02:12:51,517 --> 02:12:54,218
Well, the entire region
is uninhabitable.

996
02:12:54,252 --> 02:12:56,954
It's well known, your Majesty.

997
02:12:56,988 --> 02:13:01,092
Your uninhabited South

998
02:13:01,125 --> 02:13:04,195
exhibits evidence
of human activity.

999
02:13:04,228 --> 02:13:06,532
I wasn't aware of this.

1000
02:13:06,565 --> 02:13:09,100
I swear to you, I wasn't
aware of any of this.

1001
02:13:14,105 --> 02:13:15,541
<i>Muad'Dib</i> is alive.

1002
02:13:17,008 --> 02:13:18,209
I must find him.

1003
02:14:38,657 --> 02:14:40,157
Fire!

1004
02:15:19,831 --> 02:15:22,300
Sardaukar! On guard!

1005
02:19:36,054 --> 02:19:37,055
Sardaukar!

1006
02:20:42,554 --> 02:20:43,922
Grandfather.

1007
02:21:06,044 --> 02:21:07,646
You die like an animal.

1008
02:21:38,877 --> 02:21:39,911
<i>Muad'Dib.</i>

1009
02:23:09,601 --> 02:23:10,702
Rabban!

1010
02:23:21,813 --> 02:23:23,581
Look who's back from the dead.

1011
02:23:37,929 --> 02:23:41,266
For my Duke, and my friends.

1012
02:24:46,898 --> 02:24:47,932
Warships.

1013
02:24:50,268 --> 02:24:51,369
The Great Houses.

1014
02:24:52,937 --> 02:24:55,406
Gurney, it's time.
Bring the prisoners.

1015
02:24:55,440 --> 02:24:59,043
My Lord.

1016
02:25:22,901 --> 02:25:24,068
This isn't over yet.

1017
02:25:30,074 --> 02:25:31,309
I want you to know...

1018
02:25:34,245 --> 02:25:36,247
I will love you
as long as I breathe.

1019
02:25:48,460 --> 02:25:50,929
There is a massed armada
in orbit.

1020
02:25:54,332 --> 02:25:58,102
You're facing
a full invasion, Fremen.

1021
02:25:58,136 --> 02:26:01,239
How can you be so sure the
Great Houses are here for me?

1022
02:26:07,212 --> 02:26:11,517
They may be curious to hear my
side of the story, don't you think?

1023
02:26:11,550 --> 02:26:16,120
I am Paul Atreides, son of
Leto Atreides, Duke of Arrakis.

1024
02:26:17,956 --> 02:26:19,424
- Gurney.
- My Lord.

1025
02:26:19,458 --> 02:26:21,826
Send a warning to all ships.

1026
02:26:21,859 --> 02:26:25,797
If the Great Houses attack, our
atomics will obliterate all spice fields.

1027
02:26:27,298 --> 02:26:30,001
- You're out of your mind.
- He's bluffing.

1028
02:26:30,034 --> 02:26:32,103
Consider what you're
about to do, Paul Atreides.

1029
02:26:32,136 --> 02:26:34,339
Silence!

1030
02:26:36,508 --> 02:26:38,009
Abomination.

1031
02:26:42,247 --> 02:26:43,815
Message sent, my Lord.

1032
02:26:45,850 --> 02:26:49,420
As a servant of the Imperium,
you will bow at my feet.

1033
02:26:49,455 --> 02:26:53,057
Your feet? You'll be lucky
to keep your head.

1034
02:26:56,294 --> 02:26:57,929
I'll take the hand
of your daughter.

1035
02:27:00,431 --> 02:27:02,433
She will remain safe.

1036
02:27:02,468 --> 02:27:05,103
And we will rule together
over the Empire.

1037
02:27:14,879 --> 02:27:16,114
But you...

1038
02:27:18,983 --> 02:27:20,552
You have to answer
for my father.

1039
02:27:28,192 --> 02:27:31,929
Do you know why I killed him?

1040
02:27:33,197 --> 02:27:35,166
Because he was a man

1041
02:27:35,199 --> 02:27:37,168
who believed
in the rules of the heart.

1042
02:27:38,537 --> 02:27:40,438
But the heart
is not meant to rule.

1043
02:27:42,040 --> 02:27:43,074
In other words...

1044
02:27:45,477 --> 02:27:49,147
your father was a weak man.

1045
02:27:58,222 --> 02:28:01,259
Stand or choose your champion.

1046
02:28:04,095 --> 02:28:05,531
I am here, Atreides.

1047
02:28:08,099 --> 02:28:09,334
I need a blade.

1048
02:28:09,367 --> 02:28:11,002
Accept mine.

1049
02:28:23,014 --> 02:28:26,017
Do not stain your hands
on this animal.

1050
02:28:26,050 --> 02:28:27,385
Let me deal with him.

1051
02:28:27,418 --> 02:28:29,153
It's my burden, Gurney.

1052
02:28:47,673 --> 02:28:50,174
Why does he take such risks?

1053
02:28:50,208 --> 02:28:52,511
<i>Muad'Dib</i> leads the way.

1054
02:29:16,367 --> 02:29:19,671
I'm happy
to finally meet you, cousin.

1055
02:29:21,105 --> 02:29:23,941
Cousin? Is that right?

1056
02:29:26,210 --> 02:29:31,115
Well, you wouldn't be
the first relative I've killed.

1057
02:29:33,719 --> 02:29:36,555
May thy knife chip and shatter.

1058
02:29:39,991 --> 02:29:44,128
May thy knife chip and shatter.

1059
02:30:35,146 --> 02:30:37,982
She's your pet?

1060
02:30:52,764 --> 02:30:56,133
Any special attention for the pet?

1061
02:32:22,854 --> 02:32:24,756
You have fought well, Atreides.

1062
02:32:32,497 --> 02:32:34,165
<i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

1063
02:32:34,198 --> 02:32:36,434
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

1064
02:33:28,954 --> 02:33:31,657
<i>You should've believed.</i>

1065
02:33:31,690 --> 02:33:33,324
<i>You chose the wrong side.</i>

1066
02:33:34,626 --> 02:33:36,293
<i>Side?</i>

1067
02:33:36,327 --> 02:33:39,397
<i>You, of all people, should know.</i>

1068
02:33:39,430 --> 02:33:43,802
<i>There are no sides...
Reverend Mother.</i>

1069
02:34:02,988 --> 02:34:04,890
The life debt has been paid.

1070
02:34:04,923 --> 02:34:06,758
Spare my father now and
I will be your willing bride.

1071
02:34:06,792 --> 02:34:08,325
The throne will be yours.

1072
02:35:40,886 --> 02:35:44,456
My Lord,
the Great Houses have answered.

1073
02:35:44,489 --> 02:35:46,390
They refuse to honor your ascendancy.

1074
02:35:47,893 --> 02:35:51,029
We await your orders,
<i>Lisan al-Gaib.</i>

1075
02:36:00,105 --> 02:36:01,940
Lead them to Paradise.

1076
02:36:01,973 --> 02:36:03,642
<i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

1077
02:36:03,675 --> 02:36:05,911
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

1078
02:36:20,892 --> 02:36:24,563
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

1079
02:36:33,104 --> 02:36:34,906
<i>What is happening, Mother?</i>

1080
02:36:36,975 --> 02:36:39,477
Your brother attacks
the Great Houses.

1081
02:36:43,014 --> 02:36:45,449
The Holy War begins.
